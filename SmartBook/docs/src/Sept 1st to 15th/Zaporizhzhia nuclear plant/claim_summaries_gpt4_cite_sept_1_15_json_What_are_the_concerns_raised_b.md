Ukraine has raised concerns about the Russian forces' control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which has been occupied by Russia but run by Ukrainian engineers since the start of the conflict. The Ukrainian authorities claim that Russia is using the plant as a shield, storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. They also accuse Russia of recklessly connecting the plant to its own power grid and allege that Russia has misled the IAEA inspection mission <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Owing to the fighting and damage, only one of the plant's six reactors remains operational, raising fears of a radiation leak or a reactor meltdown <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also expressed concerns about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The IAEA reports that the "physical integrity" of the plant has been violated, and damage to the building during heavy shelling has been observed <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This condition necessitated the agency to keep two experts at the facility for constant monitoring and providing independent assessments <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The agency has called for the establishment of a security zone around the plant, stressing that the current situation is untenable and there is an urgent need for measures to prevent a nuclear accident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The IAEA Director-General, Rafael Mariano Grossi, warned that persistent shelling could lead to a catastrophic event <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
