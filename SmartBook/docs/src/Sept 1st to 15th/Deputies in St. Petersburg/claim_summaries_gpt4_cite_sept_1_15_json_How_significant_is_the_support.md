Deputy Nikita Yuferev's public call for Russian President Vladimir Putin's resignation, despite threats of fines and jail time, points to a possible shift in public sentiment against Putin's government <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. A petition demanding Putin's resignation, signed by 65 municipal representatives and co-authored by Dmitry Palyuga, suggests a growing form of dissent among elected officials, despite the risk of heavy prison sentences for discrediting the armed forces or spreading false information about them <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This dissent is further evidenced by a second municipal council in Moscow's Lomonosovsky district voting on a similar motion for Putin's resignation, indicating that public support for the war in Ukraine might not be universal <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Public support for Yuferev and others' anti-war stance suggests a potential erosion of support for Putin's actions in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The increasing public support for Nikita Yuferev and other deputies advocating for Russian President Vladimir Putin's resignation suggests a potential shift in public sentiment against Putin and his government <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Yuferev, a deputy in St. Petersburg's Smolninskoye Municipal District, has even garnered offers from supporters to pay his fines and legal fees and to help relocate his family to Mexico for safety <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. His call for Putin's resignation is not isolated. Other local deputies, including 65 municipal representatives from St. Petersburg, Moscow, and several other regions, have also signed a petition calling for the same <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>This dissent among elected representatives is unusual in Russia, where laws have been enacted that punish those who "discredit" the armed forces or spread "deliberately false information" about them <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This growing opposition, coupled with the risk these deputies are willing to take, signifies a changing public opinion against Putin's actions, especially in regard to the war in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Further, the support these deputies have received from the public also serves as evidence that the war does not enjoy universal backing <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite this, it remains uncertain how these calls for resignation will practically precipitate Putin's resignation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Nonetheless, the public support for these deputies sends a strong message to Putin's powerful opponents that they have backing amongst the Russian populace <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

Its signatories also put themselves at risk for punishment under laws passed shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine that outlaw virtually all anti-war dissent. "President Putin's actions are detrimental to the future of Russia and its citizens," reads the petition shared on Twitter by Ksenia Torstrem, a deputy for St. Petersburgs Semyonovsky district.

Outspoken criticism of Putin is rare, and while the two motions were little more than symbolic statements, they represented a remarkable public rebuke. They also served as evidence that public support for the war in Ukraine is not universal, and could be eroding as a recent survey of Russian public opinion found. "We believe that the decision made by President Putin to start the special military operation is detrimental to the security of Russia and its citizens," the Smolninsky document filed on Wednesday evening said.|

Soon afterward, Yeltsin emerged as a hero defending democracy against the coup that held Gorbachev captive for three days. He was supported by tens of thousands of ordinary citizens who stood guard around Russias parliament, the White House, and rallied massively in Leningrad in front of the Winter Palace to prevent an assault by the army and the KGB. When the Soviet president returned to Moscow, Yeltsin effectively carried out his own countercoup against Gorbachev, reducing him to a figurehead and engineering Russias exit from the USSR.|

The author of the appeal, Dmitry Palyuga, posted it on Twitter, alleging Putin was responsible for "(1) the decimation of young able-bodied Russian men who would serve the workforce better than the military; (2) Russias economic downturn and brain drain; (3) NATOs expansion eastward, including adding Finland and Sweden to "double" its border with Russia; (4) the opposite effect of the "special military operation" in Ukraine." Palyuga and fellow Deputy Nikita Yuferev later posted on Twitter a summons issued to them by the St. Petersburg police for their "discrediting of the ruling establishment".

Several hours later, the number had grown to 65. "It is a way to show our solidarity and that we arent afraid," she says. When asked about Peskovs assertion that Russia has political pluralism, she laughs.|

She acknowledged that it was unclear how, in practice, the petition might help precipitate Mr. Putins resignation. But one signatory, Vasily Khoroshilov, a municipal deputy in Moscow, said the idea was to send a message to powerful opponents of Mr. Putin that they would have support among the Russian public.|

And besides what we know, when so much is hidden from public view, how can we know for certain how often and how deeply the monarchy interferes with democratic governance? In addition to the controversies mentioned above, she was caught up in the Paradise Papers scandal and, in my view, has protected her alleged sex abuser son, Prince Andrew, from the serious investigation that he deserves.|

Advertisement "We understand that Putin won't shed a tear and stop the operation," Nikita Yuferev, one of the councilors from St. Petersburg, told the Post. "These requests are written for people who are still in Russia and for whom the propaganda tries to assure that they are the minority, that there are no people who are against this," Yuferev said.|
