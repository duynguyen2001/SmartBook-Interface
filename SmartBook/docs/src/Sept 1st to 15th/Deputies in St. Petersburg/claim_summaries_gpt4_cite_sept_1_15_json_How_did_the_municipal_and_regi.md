The regional and municipal elections in Russia since the start of the war have sparked a wave of dissent and calls for President Vladimir Putin's resignation from dozens of municipal deputies across Moscow and St. Petersburg <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. These elections, which were the first since the onset of the war, saw a sweeping victory for pro-Kremlin candidates, and the call for Putin's resignation comes in the wake of allegations of vote rigging and a significant advance by Kyiv's forces in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The deputies who signed the petition for Putin's resignation, however, face the risk of punishment under new laws that virtually outlaw all anti-war dissent <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Despite the widespread success of pro-Kremlin candidates in the elections, the calls for Putin's resignation have underscored a lack of universal public support for the war in Ukraine and have potentially signaled an erosion of support for Putin's military actions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The deputies' open criticism of Putin is a rare public rebuke, and while their motions are largely symbolic, they nonetheless attest to growing public discontent and opposition to the war <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The petition's existence, despite Russia's crackdown on dissent, indicates that Ukraine's counteroffensive successes have emboldened Putin's opponents and left his supporters looking for someone else to blame <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

Outspoken criticism of Putin is rare, and while the two motions were little more than symbolic statements, they represented a remarkable public rebuke. They also served as evidence that public support for the war in Ukraine is not universal, and could be eroding as a recent survey of Russian public opinion found. "We believe that the decision made by President Putin to start the special military operation is detrimental to the security of Russia and its citizens," the Smolninsky document filed on Wednesday evening said.|

The petition, pushed by opponents of the Ukraine invasion, had no practical impact, and it was roundly ignored in Russias state-controlled media.

Putin newly emboldened and his supporters looking for someone else to blame.|

Another local deputy said 65 municipal representatives from St Petersburg, Moscow and several other regions had signed a petition she published on Monday calling for Putin's resignation. While posing no current threat to Putin's grip on power, the moves mark rare expressions of dissent by elected representatives at a time when Russians risk heavy prison sentences for "discrediting" the armed forces or spreading "deliberately false information" about them. Palyuga told Reuters before Tuesday's hearing that the group's appeals were aimed not only at liberal Russians but also at "people loyal to the authorities who are starting to have doubts when they see the lack of success of the Russian army".|

We demand the resignation of Vladimir Putin from the post of president of the Russian Federation," states the petition, which has been circulated widely on social networks and been picked up by several media outlets. It is a striking show of opposition in a country where the Kremlins harsh crackdown on dissent has meant Putin is rarely denigrated publicly. Since the start of the conflict, those who criticise the president risk jail time due to a law that criminalises the publication of "fake news" on the Ukraine invasion.|
