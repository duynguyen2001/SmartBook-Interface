The potential implications of Russia's threat to stop supplying oil to countries that enforce a price cap could have severe effects on the global energy market. Putin's threat to cut off energy supplies to the West, as a response to the European Union's price cap on Russian gas, could exacerbate the global energy crisis, leading to even higher prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The Russian state-controlled gas giant Gazprom's CEO has warned that European gas prices could surge significantly if supplies are severed <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Furthermore, Russia's decision to cut supplies could pose long-term costs on its oilfields, and the threat of this action could cause petroleum markets to rise <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Countries implementing a price cap could suffer from energy shortages and face severe economic implications. Eastern and southern EU countries, in particular, could be heavily impacted by a cut-off <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These disruptions could also contribute to global inflation and affect workers and businesses worldwide <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Moreover, the halt of Russian oil supplies could deepen the concerns about a winter gas shortage and the prospect of a recession in Europe <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Putin's hardline stance on the issue, warning that Russia will not supply anything that contradicts their interests, creates further uncertainty and tension in the global energy market <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.
