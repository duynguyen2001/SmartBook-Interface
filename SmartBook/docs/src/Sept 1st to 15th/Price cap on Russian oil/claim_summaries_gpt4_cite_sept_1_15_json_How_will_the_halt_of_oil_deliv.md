# How will the halt of oil deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline impact the effectiveness of the price cap strategy?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The halt of oil deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline could limit the effectiveness of the price cap strategy by potentially leading to increased global competition for gas and coal, and supporting elevated prices due to supply disruption <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This could exacerbate the energy crisis in Europe, forcing governments to spend more on support for consumers and putting further strain on their economies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
The halt of oil deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, due to an oil leak and Western sanctions, has escalated the energy crisis in Europe and may impact the effectiveness of the price cap strategy imposed by the G7 group of nations on Russian oil <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This strategy was intended to curtail Moscow's revenue from its invasion of Ukraine and to subdue inflation in the West <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. However, with the uncertainty around the resumption of oil flow through the Nord Stream pipeline, gas prices remain elevated and this trend is expected to continue for the next couple of years <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Moreover, Russia's threat to completely cut off energy supplies to the West could potentially disrupt global energy markets and lead to even higher prices, undermining the intention of the price cap strategy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The halt of oil deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has intensified the energy crisis in Europe, increasing gas prices and forcing companies to cut production. Governments have been forced to spend billions to cushion consumers from the impact, with the expectation that prices will remain elevated for the next two years or more <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. In response, G7 nations have announced a price cap strategy on Russian oil, hoping to reduce Moscow's revenue from the Ukraine invasion, and to curb inflation in the West <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>However, the effectiveness of the price cap strategy has been challenged. Russia could refuse to export oil at the lower price, potentially causing severe and lasting damage to its production capacity. Alternatively, Russia could continue to export oil to countries that refuse to abide by the G7 price cap, such as China and India <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The strategy has also been criticized for potentially increasing Europeâ€™s import prices and creating a cycle of costlier imports and larger subsidies. Furthermore, the implementation of the price cap strategy could incentivize Russia to completely cut off energy supplies to the West, causing further turmoil in global energy markets and higher prices worldwide <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

While the Kremlin denies that is the case, the big Nord Stream 1 pipeline into northern Germany has been shut indefinitely, with Moscow directly blaming sanctions. Last week, the G7 group of nations - announced a price cap for Russian oil - a move it said would reduce both Moscow's revenue for its Ukraine invasion, and inflation in the West. Finnish researchers recently estimated that Russia has made 158bn (136bn) from surging fossil fuel prices during the six-month invasion - with EU imports accounting for more than half of that.|

Global competition for gas and coal this winter is expected to prevent prices from falling. Any more disruption to Russian gas supply, such as a full stoppage through Nord Stream 1, would support prices. Although European countries are on track to refill gas storage sites to a minimum level of 80% by Oct. 1, an extra cold winter could deplete those reserves quickly.|

The Russian president said Germany and Western sanctions affecting the supply of parts were to blame for the pipeline not being operational. The impact of the surge in prices is forcing companies to curtail production and governments to spend billions on support to cushion consumers from the impact. New British Prime Minister Liz Truss is expected to unveil her plans on Thursday, with the bill from a price freeze forecast to rise towards 100 billion pounds.|

Russia scrapped a Saturday deadline for flows down the Nord Stream pipeline to resume, citing an oil leak in a turbine. It coincided with the Group of Seven finance ministers announcing a price cap on Russian oil. The euro slid to $0.9876 in early European trade, the lowest level since 2002, while sterling -- with the British economy also vulnerable to rising gas prices -- dropped half a percent to a new 2-1/2 year low of $1.1444.|

Just before the European Union announced a price cap on Russian gas on Wednesday (7 September), Putin threatened to sever supplies if such limits were imposed, warning the West it would freeze like the wolfs tail in a famous Russian fairy tale. Halting flows to Europe from Russia, the worlds second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the top natural gas exporter, would likely further roil global energy markets and leave the world economy facing even higher prices. Alexei Miller, chief executive of Russian state-controlled gas giant Gazprom, said in August that European gas prices could surge to $4,000 per thousand cubic metres, from around $2,200 seen on Wednesday.|

The question is, will these work? The crucial challenge will be enforcement. There are three main problems.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> The unexpected delay was attributed to mechanical problems with the pipeline, but it raised concerns that it was in retaliation for the price cap, an idea that Moscow has condemned.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/business/economy/g7-russian-oil-price-cap.html" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Sep 2nd, 2022</div></div>| The untested plan has been pushed by the Biden administration as way of keeping sanctions pressure on Russia while minimizing the impact on a global economy that has been saddled with soaring energy and food prices this year. Hours after the G7 ministers announced their plan on Friday, Gazprom, the Russian-owned energy giant, said it would postpone restarting the flow of natural gas through a closely watched pipeline that connects Russia to Germany, known as Nord Stream 1. The unexpected delay was attributed to mechanical problems with the pipeline, but it raised concerns that it was in retaliation for the price cap, an idea that Moscow has condemned. Eric Mamer, a spokesman for the European Commission, said that the "fallacious pretenses" for the latest delay were "proof of Russias cynicism."|

Europe is scrambling to wean itself off Russian supplies and build up reserves before the cold winter months, but investors reckon the hit to its economy will be huge. Russia scrapped a Saturday deadline for flows down the Nord Stream pipeline to resume, citing an oil leak in a turbine.

Russia could refuse to export oil at the lower price, though that would not only reduce one of its few sources of external revenue, it also would require shutting down oil wells that arent easily restarted. An extended shutdown of Russian oil wells could do severe and lasting damage to its production capacity. But Russia could continue to export oil to countries that refuse to abide by the G7 price cap, eg China and India.|
