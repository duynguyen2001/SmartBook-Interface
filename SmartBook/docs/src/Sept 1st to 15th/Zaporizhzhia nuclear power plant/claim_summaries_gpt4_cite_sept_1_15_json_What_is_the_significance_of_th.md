The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), led by Director General Rafael Grossi, has initiated a Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) to ensure the nuclear safety and security of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP). The ISAMZ team will carry out a detailed assessment of the physical damage to the plant's facilities, determine the functionality of the main and backup safety and security systems, and evaluate the working conditions of the staff <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The IAEA has now established a continuous presence at the plant to help stabilize the situation and carry out vital safeguard activities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is of strategic importance as it accounts for nearly half of the total electricity generated by Ukraine's nuclear power plants and one-fifth of its annual electricity production <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

The reactor was disconnected from the Ukrainian grid last week and was operating in an "island mode," generating electricity and using its own energy to power cooling systems. Last week, a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for the "immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone" around thenuclear power plant. The highly anticipated report came days after IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi led an expert mission to Zaporizhzhia, in what was the first independent look at the condition of the facility since Russia seized it at the start of the war.|

There are fears the fighting could trigger a catastrophe on the scale of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. The plant was built during the Soviet era and is one of the 10 biggest in the world. Neither Moscow nor Kiev officials would immediately commit to the idea of a safety zone, saying more details of the proposal were needed.|
