Ukrainian forces continued targeting Russian military assets and positions in Kherson Oblast, likely steadily degrading them. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced the restoration of the second reserve power transmission line to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP). Ukraines sweeping counteroffensive is damaging Russian administrative capabilities and driving Russian departures from occupied parts of Ukraine far behind the line of contact.|

The IAEA intends to keep two experts at the facility on an extended basis, but the agencys power to change the conditions at the plant including reported anxiety and exhaustion on the part of the Ukrainian workers, heavy fighting around the plant, and Russian attempts to connect the plant to its own power grid is limited.|

Monitors from the I.A.E.A., including the agencys director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, visited the facility last week amid continuing shelling of the area that at one point forced them to take cover. In a report on its findings, the agency said that shelling should be "stopped immediately" and that it was prepared to start consultations with both sides in the conflict over security at the plant, which is the largest in Europe. For weeks, fighting around the large facility which was seized by Russian forces in March but is operated by Ukrainian engineers has raised fears of a nuclear accident.|

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected from its last external power line. However, the facility is still managing to supply electricity to the grid through a reserve line.|

A "serious situation" developedafter the power infrastructure feeding the city of Enerhodar which houses the plant operators and their families was destroyed by shelling, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement.|

The damage to critical infrastructure around the facility has been significant, and there are fears more damage could lead to a radiation disaster in the country that still manages the cleanup of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster. Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the plant on Thursday for an independent inspection after they were delayed by yet more shelling. Russian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in early March as part of what Moscow calls its "special military operation" in Ukraine.|

Since a Sept. 5 fire caused by shelling knocked the plant off transmission lines, the reactor was powering crucial safety equipment in so-called "island mode" an unreliable regime that left the plant increasingly vulnerable to a potential nuclear accident. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog that has two experts at the site, welcomed the restoration of external power. But IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said he is "gravely concerned about the situation at the plant, which remains in danger as long as any shelling continues."|
