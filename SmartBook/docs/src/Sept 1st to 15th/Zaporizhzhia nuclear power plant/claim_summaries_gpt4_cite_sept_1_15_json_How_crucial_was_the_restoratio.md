# How crucial was the restoration of the transmission line linking the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to Ukraine's power system?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The restoration of the transmission line linking the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to Ukraine's power system was crucial as it allowed for the shutdown and transfer of the plant's last operating reactor to a safe cold state, which was previously operating in an "island mode" due to the disconnection from the Ukrainian grid <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This restoration is also significant considering the plant's contribution to Ukraine's annual electricity production and the fact that it had been relying on a reserve line for power supply after losing its last main power line <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, the largest nuclear complex in Europe, had its last operating reactor shut down after the restoration of a transmission line linking the plant to Ukraine's power system <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The plant, which accounts for nearly half of the total electricity generated by Ukraine's nuclear power plants and one-fifth of the country's annual electricity production, was "completely shut down" after the plant's number 6 power unit was disconnected from the grid, and arrangements for its cooling and transfer to a cold state were initiated <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This restoration was crucial as the facility had been operating in an "island mode," generating electricity and using its own energy to power cooling systems, which are essential for the safe functioning of nuclear power plants <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The plants' power was previously supplied by four high-voltage lines, which connected the nuclear complex to Ukraine's electricity grid.

The plant, the largest nuclear complex of its kind in Europe, was "completely shut down" after the plant's number 6 power unit was disconnected from the grid at 3:41 a.m. local time, the agency said in a statement, adding that "arrangements for its cooling and transfer to a cold state are underway." Energoatom said that one of the transmission lines was restored to its operational capacity Saturday, making it possible to power the plant from Ukraine's energy system and shut down the number 6 power unit and transfer it to the "safest state cold shutdown." The reactor was disconnected from the Ukrainian grid last week and was operating in an "island mode," generating electricity and using its own energy to power cooling systems.|

Specifically, nuclear power plants require water to be pumped constantly through their cores in order to function safely, and the pumps need electricity. At Zaporizhzhia, the power is normally supplied by four high-voltage lines, which connect the nuclear complex to Ukraine's electricity grid, but the conflict has seen those lines systematically cut. The last 750kV line was severed on September 3, according to the IAEA.|

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected from its last external power line. However, the facility is still managing to supply electricity to the grid through a reserve line.|

Ukrainian forces continued targeting Russian military assets and positions in Kherson Oblast, likely steadily degrading them. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced the restoration of the second reserve power transmission line to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP). Ukraines sweeping counteroffensive is damaging Russian administrative capabilities and driving Russian departures from occupied parts of Ukraine far behind the line of contact.|

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) added that the plant, Europe's largest, is now relying on a reserve line to supply power to Ukraine's grid. Separately, Ukraine's state nuclear company said only one of the station's six reactors now remains in operation. Both Ukraine and Russia accuse each other of repeatedly shelling the plant.|

The plant and surrounding areas have been repeatedly hit by shelling that Russia and Ukraine blame on each other. The last power line connecting the plant to the Ukrainian electricity grid was cut Monday, leaving the plant without an outside source of electricity. It is receiving power for its own safety systems from the only reactor out of six total that remains operational.|

The three others were lost earlier during the conflict. However, the IAEA experts now present at Europes largest nuclear power plant located in the middle of a war zone also learnt that the 330/750 kV reserve line linking the facility to a nearby thermal power plant was delivering the electricity the ZNPP generates to the external grid. The same reserve line can also provide back-up power to the ZNPP if needed.|

In a statement, it presented the retreat as a preplanned move, intended to strengthen its efforts in the east where its army has been bogged down for weeks. Maintaining control of towns and cities has at times proven tenuous over the course of the war, and it was not immediately clear how secure Ukraines control over Izium was and what efforts Russia might take to try to win it back. But the loss of Izium a strategically important railway hub that Russian forces seized in the spring after a bloody weekslong battle could mark a turning point in the war, dwarfed only by Russias humiliating defeat around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in the spring.|

"Arrangements for its cooling and transfer to a cold state are underway," Energoatom said, adding that in recent days the sixth and last operating reactor at the plant had been powering exclusively the facility's in-house needs because "all transmission lines linking the Zaporizhzhya NPP to the Ukrainian power system were damaged due to Russian shelling." The U.N. nuclear watchdog had warned on Friday that this could happen following renewed shelling around the nuclear facility the largest in Europe.|

Following the incident, Energoatom said both reactors have been reconnected to the Ukrainian grid. However, the generators can run for a limited time in an emergency, and the situation requires restoring the external power supply as soon as possible. The condition of the generators is itself unknown; the IAEA mission will have to check if they are in working condition.|
