# What strategies can the G7 and EU employ to minimize the risk of Russia cutting off oil supplies to countries that adhere to the price cap?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
To minimize the risk of Russia cutting off oil supplies due to the price cap, the G7 and EU can diversify their energy sources by engaging with alternative suppliers from Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, as Russian producers face increased competition in these regions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Additionally, they can continue to employ financial tools and novel economic strategies to reduce dependence on Russian oil and deter the country from using energy revenue for military power projection <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
In response to the G7's implementation of a $60 price cap on Russian oil, Russia has threatened to halt oil shipments to participating countries <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The EU and UK have joined in banning Russian oil, adding to the pressure on Russia's energy sector <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. OPEC+, including Russia, has agreed to maintain its current production reduction, which could mitigate some of the supply risks by ensuring market stability <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the G7 and EU's strategy includes the objective of depriving Russia of the funds necessary to sustain its military efforts, aiming to deter the country's aggression while attempting to maintain global energy supply and economic stability <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
In response to Russia's warning to halt oil shipments to countries adhering to the $60 price cap, the G7 and EU could explore alternative policies aimed at reducing Russian oil revenues without solely relying on the price cap strategy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. One such policy could involve the imposition of import tariffs on Russian oil, which has been favored by some European policy analysts over the price cap, as it could potentially cut Russia's oil revenues while still allowing for some degree of oil trade with Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Additionally, the G7, alongside Australia and the EU, has indicated a willingness to consider further actions to ensure the effectiveness of the price cap, which may include adjustment mechanisms to keep the cap below market prices or other economic measures yet to be detailed <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>To mitigate the potential risks associated with Russia's threats, the G7 and EU can leverage well-established economic tools as well as novel approaches that push the boundaries of economic statecraft <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The Treasury Department's objectives to deprive Russia of the means to wage war, prevent military power projection, and denounce war crimes could serve as guiding principles for developing these strategies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the G7 and EU could strengthen their multilateral approach to sanctions by coordinating with countries that have either banned Russian oil imports or are in the process of phasing them out, ensuring a more united front against Russia's actions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. This multilateral coordination could help stabilize global energy supplies while still limiting Russian oil revenues <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February, India has become the main outlet for seaborne cargoes of Urals crude.|

Accordingly, the Treasury Department is using its financial authorities to achieve three objectives: (1) deprive Russia of the enabling means necessary to wage war in Ukraine; (2) prevent Russia from projecting military power; and (3) deter and denounce Russian war crimes and human rights abuses in Ukraine. To achieve these objectives, we have brought to bear both well-establish tools from our economic arsenal as well as bold, novel approaches that are pushing the boundaries of economic statecraft. Yesterdays news represents the culmination of our efforts to pursue one such novel economic approach: the United States, alongside Australia, the G7 countries, and the EU put into effect a price cap on Russian-origin oil to reduce the Kremlins oil revenues.|

Europe's ban on importing oil from Russia shipped by sea kicks in on Monday, injecting extra uncertainty into the outlook for energy supply. G7 nations, the European Union and Australia agreed Friday to impose a price cap of $60 a barrel on Russian oil shipped to other countries that have not adopted an embargo. The move, which also takes effect Monday, is aimed at depriving the Kremlin of revenue while avoiding a price shock by keeping Russian oil flowing to some markets.|

A fourth option would be an import tariff on Russian oila policy that several influential policy analysts in Europe favored over the price cap.

So if the price cap fails, members of the G7 need not throw up their hands in defeat.|

Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter. The agreement allows Russian oil to be shipped to third-party countries using tankers from G7 and European Union member states, insurance companies and credit institutions, only if the cargo is bought at or below the $60 per barrel cap. Moscow has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production.|

In an effort to further limit Russias oil revenues without imposing additional secondary sanctions, and while simultaneously trying to stabilize global energy supply, the United States instituted the price cap. As part of a more coordinated multilateral approach to sanctions, the G7 (the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom) and Australia agreed to adopt the $60 per barrel cap proposed by the European Union. The countries that agreed to the price cap have either already banned the import of Russian oil or have committed to prohibiting or phasing out such imports.|

No details were immediately available on what further actions could be taken. The price cap, a G7 idea, aims to reduce Russia's income from selling oil, while preventing a spike in global oil prices after an EU embargo on Russian crude takes effect on Dec. 5. Warsaw had resisted the proposed level as it examined an adjustment mechanism to keep the cap below the market price.|
