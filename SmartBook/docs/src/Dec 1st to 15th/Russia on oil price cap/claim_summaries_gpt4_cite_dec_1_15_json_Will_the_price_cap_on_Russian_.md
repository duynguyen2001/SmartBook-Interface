# Will the price cap on Russian oil lead to an increase in illicit trade and sanctions evasion activities?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The implementation of a price cap on Russian oil by the EU and G7, alongside an EU embargo, is expected to bolster the already emerging under-the-radar oil trade, as Russia seeks to evade these sanctions and continue financing its war efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This shadow market may lead to increased illicit shipments and sales by vessel owners and traders willing to flout the restrictions, despite the potential risks and uncertainties surrounding the cap's impact on global oil prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

The implementation of a $60 price cap on Russian oil by the EU and G7, along with an EU embargo, is expected to escalate illicit oil trade as Russia seeks alternative markets, notably in Asia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite the aim of these measures to undercut Russia's war financing, there is uncertainty regarding their impact on global oil prices and the potential for Russia to continue selling oil, possibly bypassing the cap <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The sanctions have already prompted a competitive environment among Russian producers and other suppliers, possibly driving down prices further <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Analysts are concerned that the sanctions and the price cap may not effectively constrain Russia's oil revenues if evasion and under-the-radar trading increase <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

The implementation of a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil by the EU and the G7, alongside an EU embargo on Russian crude oil imports, is expected to exacerbate illicit shipments of oil as Russia seeks to bypass these financial constraints <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. As sanctions on oil exports from Venezuela, Iran, and now Russia, have fostered an underground oil trade, the recent measures are likely to further incentivize vessel owners, shipping firms, and traders to engage in sanction-evading activities to sell Russian oil to willing buyers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Additionally, Russia's refusal to comply with the price cap and its readiness to cut production rather than sell oil below the set cap may lead to intensified competition among Russian producers and with other suppliers, potentially resulting in lower prices to attract buyers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The potential impact of the price cap on global oil prices and energy market stability remains uncertain. Some analysts predict that the cap, along with the EU's ban on Russian seaborne crude, could strain the global market by reducing Russian oil supply and drive up gas prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Others suggest that Russia might circumvent the cap, maintaining its oil export rates and thus mitigating effects on gas prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The Kremlin has stated it will not sell oil to countries enforcing the cap, which could lead to increased oil prices and destabilize energy markets according to Russian officials <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The Western strategy of capping Russian oil profits as a response to the Ukraine conflict adds another layer of complexity to the already volatile energy landscape, with potential repercussions for both legal and illicit oil trade dynamics <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

|---|---|---|
|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The EU embargo on Russian crude oil imports and the price cap on Russian crude are set to further increase illicit shipments of oil.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/oilpricecom-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Black-Market-For-Oil-Is-Booming.html" target="_blank">OilPrice.com</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Russia is already thought to be amassing a "dark fleet" of tankers to ship its oil outside the price cap regime. The EU embargo on Russian crude oil imports and the price cap on Russian crude are set to further increase illicit shipments of oil. The sanctions on the oil exports of Venezuela and Iran, and now Russia, have given rise to a lucrative under-the-radar oil trade in which less scrupulous vessel owners, shipping firms, and traders continue to sell sanctioned oil to those willing to take the risk to buy it.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> It is not yet clear how much Russian oil the two sanctions measures could take off the global market, which would tighten supply and drive up prices.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/first-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/04/1140629951/opec-keeps-oil-targets-the-same-amid-uncertainty-on-russian-sanctions" target="_blank">Up First</a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Dec 4th, 2022</div></div>| The decision at a meeting of oil ministers Sunday comes a day ahead of the planned start of two measures aimed at hitting Russia's oil earnings in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Those are: a European Union boycott of most Russian oil and a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian exports imposed by the EU and the Group of Seven democracies. It is not yet clear how much Russian oil the two sanctions measures could take off the global market, which would tighten supply and drive up prices. The world's No.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> While the exact effect of the price cap remains unclear, some analysts expect the move to send gas prices higher in the coming months as the global market strains under lost Russian oil supply.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/abc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/cap-russian-oil-send-gas-prices-rising/story?id=94480014" target="_blank">ABC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The Western scheme aims to choke off the primary source of funds behind the Russian war in Ukraine but the move risks disrupting the global oil supply and spiking gas prices. The newly announced measures contributed to a jump in global oil prices in early trading on Monday but prices retreated later in the day. While the exact effect of the price cap remains unclear, some analysts expect the move to send gas prices higher in the coming months as the global market strains under lost Russian oil supply. However, Russia may circumvent the price cap and continue selling oil at its current rate, mitigating any effect on gas prices, other analysts said.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Russia has said it will not abide by the cap even if it has to cut production.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russian-oil-sold-india-below-price-cap-buyers-market-2022-12-14/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 14th, 2022</div></div>| The European Union ban on imports of Russia's seaborne oil from Dec. 5 has driven Moscow to seek alternative markets, mainly in Asia, for about 1 million barrels per day. Also on Dec. 5, the Group of Seven leading economies implemented a $60 price cap on Russian seaborne oil to try to limit Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine. Russia has said it will not abide by the cap even if it has to cut production. The Western actions have left Russian producers in fierce competition with each other and with suppliers from Asia, Europe and the Middle East, meaning their best hope of finding buyers is to lower prices, two traders said.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> However, analysts and policymakers are uncertain as to what effect the cap will have on oil prices, especially since Russia has been selling oil at a discount believed to be about $48 per barrel.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/investopedia-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/opec-maintains-production-cuts-as-eu-bans-russian-oil-6835651" target="_blank">Investopedia</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The EUs ban on all imports of Russian seaborne crude takes effect today, as well as the G7 price cap of $60 per barrel. The price cap is meant to curb profits Russia makes on its oil exports to finance the war in Ukraine. However, analysts and policymakers are uncertain as to what effect the cap will have on oil prices, especially since Russia has been selling oil at a discount believed to be about $48 per barrel. The Kremlin has warned it will not trade any oil at all with nations that implement the price cap.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Will this new cap have any impact?|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.fool.ca/2022/12/08/even-at-60-oil-these-energy-stocks-are-still-ridiculously-cheap/" target="_blank">fool.ca</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 8th, 2022</div></div>| Prominent oil buyers across the world have collectively decided to cap the price of oil exported from Russia. Last week, members of the G7 and European Union bloc of nations decided to implement a US$60 price cap on crude oil exported from Russia. Will this new cap have any impact? What does it mean for Canadian oil stocks?|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> However, Russia - which is the world's second biggest producer of crude oil - has said it will not accept the price cap and threatened to stop exporting oil to countries adopting the measures.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63855030" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| It will stop any Russian crude sold for more than that price from being shipped using G7 and EU tankers, insurance companies and credit institutions. Many major global shipping and insurance companies are based within the G7. However, Russia - which is the world's second biggest producer of crude oil - has said it will not accept the price cap and threatened to stop exporting oil to countries adopting the measures. Jorge Leon, senior vice-president at Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy, told the BBC's Today programme that oil prices could increase as a result.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> No formal agreement has yet been reached, although Reuters reported Thursday that EU governments had tentatively agreed to a $60 barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/02/opec-meeting-oil-output-cuts-on-the-table-ahead-of-russia-sanctions.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 2nd, 2022</div></div>| The 27-nation EU bloc agreed in June to ban the purchase of Russian seaborne crude from Dec. 5 as part of a concerted effort to curtail the Kremlin's war chest following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Concern that an outright ban on Russian crude imports could send oil prices soaring, however, prompted the G-7 to consider a price cap on the amount it will pay for Russian oil. No formal agreement has yet been reached, although Reuters reported Thursday that EU governments had tentatively agreed to a $60 barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil. "The other factor OPEC will need to consider is indeed the price cap," Galimberti said.|

The G7 - which includes Britain and the United States - has agreed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil. The United States became the world's largest LNG exporter in the first half of 2022, U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed as the country rapidly increased its export capacity and high prices, particularly in Europe led to higher exports. Britain said the United States would aim to export 9-10 billion cubic metres of LNG over the next year under the agreement, maintaining the increase in exports seen this year.|

However the price cap would have an effect on the stability of the energy market, said Peskov. "One thing is obvious and indisputable: the adoption of these decisions is a step towards destabilizing the world energy markets," he said.|
