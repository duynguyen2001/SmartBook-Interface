# How will Russia's refusal to recognize the Western-imposed oil price cap affect its oil export strategy and global market share?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Russia's threat to halt oil exports to countries enforcing the G7 and EU-imposed price cap could lead to a reduction in its global market share and potentially drive up global oil prices due to decreased supply <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This refusal also risks further isolating Russia from major international shipping and insurance services, making it more challenging to sell its oil above the capped price <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
Russia's refusal to accept the G7 and EU oil price cap could lead to a reduction in its oil exports, as the cap prevents Russian crude from being shipped using key global shipping and insurance companies based in G7 countries unless it is sold at or below the cap <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This could result in Russia potentially cutting production if it opts not to sell oil at the capped price, which would impact its global market share and foreign currency earnings that have historically been significant since the discovery of oil and gas in Siberia post-World War Two <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The potential decrease in Russian oil on the global market may tighten supply and drive up prices, affecting the global economy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Overcompliance with the sanctions by traders, insurers, or shipping firms could exacerbate the supply reduction, further influencing global oil prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
Russia's adamant refusal to recognize the Western-imposed oil price cap of $60 per barrel is poised to significantly reshape its oil export strategy and potentially impact its global market share. In response to the cap, which is enforced by the G7 and the EU's leverage over key shipping and insurance services, Russia has threatened to halt oil exports to nations complying with the measures, even if it necessitates a reduction in production <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. This stance suggests Russia may intensify efforts to seek alternative markets, primarily in Asia, to compensate for the loss of Western buyers, as the EU's ban on seaborne Russian oil imports further constricts traditional trade avenues <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>The global oil market is likely to experience volatility due to Russia's decision and the new sanctions. If Russia follows through on its threats to cut oil production or withhold exports from participating countries, the reduced supply could lead to an increase in oil prices, affecting the global market <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, with Russia's oil already being sold at a discount and the country's production levels not showing a significant decrease, the actual impact on its market share and global oil prices remains uncertain <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The situation is further complicated by the possibility of overcompliance from companies avoiding engagement with Russian oil below the cap, which could exacerbate supply reductions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Many major global shipping and insurance companies are based within the G7. However, Russia - which is the world's second biggest producer of crude oil - has said it will not accept the price cap and threatened to stop exporting oil to countries adopting the measures. Jorge Leon, senior vice-president at Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy, told the BBC's Today programme that oil prices could increase as a result.|

As the world's key shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the cap could make it difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price. Russia, which is the world's second-largest oil exporter, said on Sunday it would not accept the cap and would not sell oil that is subject to it, even if it has to cut production. Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources of Russian foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War Two.|

Those are: a European Union boycott of most Russian oil and a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian exports imposed by the EU and the Group of Seven democracies. It is not yet clear how much Russian oil the two sanctions measures could take off the global market, which would tighten supply and drive up prices. The world's No.|

In the case of the price cap, overcompliance would look like traders, insurers, or shipping firms refusing to deal with Russian oil even if its sold for a price below the cap. The result could be a major drop in the supply of Russian oil available on the global market, which could increase prices for everyone. (Of course, if the supply of Russian oil is squeezed but global energy prices do not increase, that would not be a problem from the perspective of the G7.)|

The situation remains fluid and evolving. Russia has indicated that it will not sell oil subject to the price cap. Meanwhile, OFAC also announced it would institute a similar price cap on Russian-origin petroleum products starting February 5, 2023.|

The agreement allows Russian oil to be shipped to third-party countries using tankers from G7 and European Union member states, insurance companies and credit institutions, only if the cargo is bought at or below the $60 per barrel cap. Moscow has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. Ukraine wants the cap set lower: Zelenskiy said $60 was too high to deter Russia's assault.|

Along with fears of further rate hikes - crude is getting swept up in the risk-off tilt of broader markets," Smith said. Russia has said it will not sell oil to anyone who signs up to the price cap. Russia's January-November oil and gas condensate production rose 2.2% from a year ago to 488 million tonnes, according to Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who expects a slight output decline following the latest sanctions.|

Also on Dec. 5, the Group of Seven leading economies implemented a $60 price cap on Russian seaborne oil to try to limit Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine. Russia has said it will not abide by the cap even if it has to cut production. The Western actions have left Russian producers in fierce competition with each other and with suppliers from Asia, Europe and the Middle East, meaning their best hope of finding buyers is to lower prices, two traders said.|

Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak repeated that on Sunday, adding that the Kremlin is prepared to cut oil production if necessary. Uncertainty over the Western restrictions and Russia's energy threats has spilled over into global oil markets. On Sunday, members of an alliance of oil-producing countries that includes Russia and Saudi Arabia but not the U.S. opted to maintain current production levels.|

The price cap is meant to curb profits Russia makes on its oil exports to finance the war in Ukraine. However, analysts and policymakers are uncertain as to what effect the cap will have on oil prices, especially since Russia has been selling oil at a discount believed to be about $48 per barrel. The Kremlin has warned it will not trade any oil at all with nations that implement the price cap.|
