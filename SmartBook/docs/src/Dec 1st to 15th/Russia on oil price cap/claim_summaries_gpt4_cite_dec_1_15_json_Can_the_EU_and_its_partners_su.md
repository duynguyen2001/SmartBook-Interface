The implementation of a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil by the EU and G7 aims to curb Russia's oil revenues while striving to avoid supply shortages in the global market <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, Russia's refusal to accept the cap and its threat to cut off oil exports to participating countries could lead to tightened supplies and increased oil prices, potentially causing economic strain <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

The EU and G7 have imposed a price cap on Russian oil to diminish Russia's oil revenues while attempting to maintain global energy supplies, but Russia has threatened to halt exports to nations enforcing the cap, potentially tightening supply and increasing oil prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The measures, including an EU boycott and a $60 per barrel price cap, raise uncertainties about the volume of Russian oil that might be withdrawn from the market, which could lead to higher prices due to supply constraints <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Major consumers like India and China may use the cap to negotiate lower prices, indicating some potential for the cap's effectiveness, yet the global energy market remains tight, suggesting crude oil prices could remain high <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. International efforts continue to target Russia's main revenue source through economic and financial actions, aiming to balance economic pressure against Russia with the need to ensure a stable global energy market <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The European Union, along with the G7 nations, has implemented a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian oil in an effort to limit Russia's revenue used to finance the war in Ukraine, while attempting to maintain adequate global crude supplies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, Russia, being the world's second-largest producer of oil, has refused to comply with the cap, threatening to halt oil exports to countries enforcing this measure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The EU's ban on imports of Russian seaborne oil and the G7's price cap are significant moves aiming to pressure Moscow but carry the risk of tightening the global oil supply and potentially driving up prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The oil price cap also allows major Russian oil buyers, such as India and China, to potentially negotiate lower prices, which could impact the effectiveness of the cap <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Analysts and policymakers are uncertain about the long-term effects of the cap on oil prices, especially since Russia has been selling oil at discounted rates already <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The cap's success is contingent on the willingness of major global shippers and insurers, predominantly based within the G7, to enforce it, as well as the ability of the EU and its partners to navigate the potential economic repercussions without significant disruption to the global energy markets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

Many major global shipping and insurance companies are based within the G7. However, Russia - which is the world's second biggest producer of crude oil - has said it will not accept the price cap and threatened to stop exporting oil to countries adopting the measures. Jorge Leon, senior vice-president at Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy, told the BBC's Today programme that oil prices could increase as a result.|

This is the root of a policy coming into effect todaya price cap on Russian oil. This policy is a way for the international community to apply economic pressure on Russias main source of revenue, energy earnings, while also ensuring the global energy market remains well supplied. As the risks Russia poses have evolved, so too has our need to assess those risks.|

Also on Dec. 5, the Group of Seven leading economies implemented a $60 price cap on Russian seaborne oil to try to limit Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine. Russia has said it will not abide by the cap even if it has to cut production. The Western actions have left Russian producers in fierce competition with each other and with suppliers from Asia, Europe and the Middle East, meaning their best hope of finding buyers is to lower prices, two traders said.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="7"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[7]</font> However, analysts and policymakers are uncertain as to what effect the cap will have on oil prices, especially since Russia has been selling oil at a discount believed to be about $48 per barrel.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/investopedia-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/opec-maintains-production-cuts-as-eu-bans-russian-oil-6835651" target="_blank">Investopedia</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The EUs ban on all imports of Russian seaborne crude takes effect today, as well as the G7 price cap of $60 per barrel. The price cap is meant to curb profits Russia makes on its oil exports to finance the war in Ukraine. However, analysts and policymakers are uncertain as to what effect the cap will have on oil prices, especially since Russia has been selling oil at a discount believed to be about $48 per barrel. The Kremlin has warned it will not trade any oil at all with nations that implement the price cap.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="8"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The European Union and the UK also joined to ban Russian oil.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.investingcube.com/brent-crude-oil-price-forecast-for-2022-2023-2025-commodities/" target="_blank">investingcube.com</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 6th, 2022</div></div>| The most recent oil price news was the decision by the G7 to place a limit on Russian ural price at $60. In its response, Russia warned that it will stop shipping oil to countries that participate in the cap. The European Union and the UK also joined to ban Russian oil. Another oil news was the decision by OPEC+ to stick with its oil production target despite headwinds.|

Concern that an outright ban on Russian crude imports could send oil prices soaring, however, prompted the G-7 to consider a price cap on the amount it will pay for Russian oil. No formal agreement has yet been reached, although Reuters reported Thursday that EU governments had tentatively agreed to a $60 barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil. "The other factor OPEC will need to consider is indeed the price cap," Galimberti said.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="10"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[10]</font> While the exact effect of the price cap remains unclear, some analysts expect the move to send gas prices higher in the coming months as the global market strains under lost Russian oil supply.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/abc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/cap-russian-oil-send-gas-prices-rising/story?id=94480014" target="_blank">ABC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The Western scheme aims to choke off the primary source of funds behind the Russian war in Ukraine but the move risks disrupting the global oil supply and spiking gas prices. The newly announced measures contributed to a jump in global oil prices in early trading on Monday but prices retreated later in the day. While the exact effect of the price cap remains unclear, some analysts expect the move to send gas prices higher in the coming months as the global market strains under lost Russian oil supply. However, Russia may circumvent the price cap and continue selling oil at its current rate, mitigating any effect on gas prices, other analysts said.|
