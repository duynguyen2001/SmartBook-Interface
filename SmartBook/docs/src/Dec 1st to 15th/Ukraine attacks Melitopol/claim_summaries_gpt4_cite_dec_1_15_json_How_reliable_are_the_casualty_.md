## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The casualty figures provided by Ukrainian and Russian sources regarding the attack on Melitopol are unreliable and conflicting, with the exiled Ukrainian mayor claiming high numbers of Russian fatalities which Reuters could not independently verify <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Challenges in verifying these numbers include the lack of independent confirmation and the Ukrainian military's nondisclosure of specifics about the targets hit during the assault <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Casualty figures provided by Ukrainian and Russian sources regarding the attacks in Melitopol are conflicting and cannot be independently verified, with Russian sources reporting two deaths and 10 injuries, and Ukrainian sources claiming hundreds of Russian soldiers were killed or wounded <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The exiled Ukrainian mayor, Ivan Fedorov, alleges that the injured were taken to hospitals in occupied Crimea due to insufficient capacity in Melitopol, suggesting higher casualties than Russian sources report, though these claims also remain unconfirmed <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Reuters and other independent entities have not been able to substantiate the reports of attacks or deaths, indicating a significant challenge in verifying the actual numbers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Additionally, the Ukrainian military has not provided specific details on the casualties, further complicating efforts to determine the reliability of the figures <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The casualty figures provided by Ukrainian and Russian sources regarding the conflict in Ukraine are difficult to verify and are often conflicting <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. For instance, in Melitopol, the Russian-installed authorities reported two deaths and ten injuries from a missile attack, while the exiled Ukrainian mayor claimed that scores of "invaders" were killed <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Similarly, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, gave high casualty numbers for Russian forces without providing evidence, while the Ukrainian military has not provided specific figures but described the targets hit <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Reuters and other independent organizations have not been able to independently confirm these reports <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The challenge in verifying casualty figures is exacerbated by the propaganda and information warfare that accompanies the conflict. For example, Ukrainian military intelligence provided figures for the use of Iranian-made drones by Russia, which correspond with Western estimates, but could not be independently verified <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. In the Donetsk region, both Ukrainian and Russian-installed officials provided reports of fatalities that also could not be independently confirmed <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Russian and Ukrainian officials have provided their own estimates of daily military casualties during the fighting in Bakhmut and Soledar, yet these figures too remain unverified <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. This lack of independent verification underscores the complexity of obtaining accurate information in wartime conditions, where the fog of war and strategic interests can skew the reported numbers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

"Meanwhile, in the Kharkiv, and Kherson regions, the Ukrainians continue to consolidate their previous gains while Russian forces bolster their defensive lines," the official said.|

Oleksandr's death was just one alleged war crime.|

The leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic, Denys Pushilin, said although Russian forces had "liberated" 338 settlements in the Donbas, Ukraine was also bringing up reserves and mounting counterattacks. It was not possible to independently verify the figures cited by both sides. Russias defence ministry said its forces quashed one counterattack on December 7 near the settlements of Pershe Travnya, Kurdyumovka, Klescheevka and Mayorsk in Donetsk.|
