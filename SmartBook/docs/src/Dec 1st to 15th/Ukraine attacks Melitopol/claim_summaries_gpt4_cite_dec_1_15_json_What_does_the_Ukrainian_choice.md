The use of HIMARS to effectively strike Russian command posts and the prioritization of Melitopol as a key objective also reflect Ukraine's strategic emphasis on weakening Russian military capabilities and reclaiming southern territories <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Ukrainian forces' strategic targeting in Melitopol, including a church repurposed as a Russian base and potential Wagner Group barracks, indicates a high level of intelligence capability, enabling them to identify and strike military assets nested within civilian areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The choice of targets, such as command posts and a bridge, reflects Ukraine's priority to disrupt Russian logistics and command structures, crucial for regaining control in the south and possibly preparing for an advance toward Crimea <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The employment of HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, capable of precision strikes, underscores Ukraine's emphasis on long-range weaponry to increase pressure on Russian forces and reclaim territory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This strategic focus, coupled with the assistance from the United States in strengthening air defenses, suggests an integrated approach to weakening Russian military footholds and restoring Ukrainian sovereignty <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Ukrainian forces' targeting of various strategic locations in Melitopol, including a church repurposed as a Russian military base, and a bridge critical for Russian logistics, demonstrates high-level intelligence capabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This precision in targeting suggests that Ukrainian intelligence has effectively gathered detailed information on Russian military occupation and deployments within the city. The ability to strike specific targets, such as the bridge and a site being used by the Wagner Group, indicates a focused effort to disrupt Russian supply lines and command structures, which are essential for maintaining their defensive positions in the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Strategically, Ukraine's choice of targets in Melitopol underlines its priorities to reclaim territory in the south and to potentially pave the way for an eventual counteroffensive towards Crimea <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The attacks on Melitopol are meant to weaken Russian defenses and morale, as indicated by an adviser to President Zelensky, who suggested that the fall of Melitopol could lead to the collapse of the Russian defense line all the way to Kherson, and further provide a direct route to Crimea <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the use of HIMARS systems, which have been critical in striking high-value targets, underscores Ukraine's strategic use of advanced weaponry provided by allies to exert pressure on Russian forces and reclaim key territories <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Perhaps to that end, the Russian-occupied town of Melitopol in that oblast has come under attack and the first images of a destroyed bridge there emerged on social media. Melitopol was also the scene of an apparent Ukrainian HIMARS attack on a Wagner Group barracks in a hotel that resulted in a varying number of deaths. Russian officials claimed just two while a former Ukrainian mayor claimed "scores," according to the BBC.|

The damage and destruction cannot be seen as simply incidental, collateral damage resulting from Russian military operations targeting Ukrainian military targets. Rather, the magnitude of the destruction suggests a deliberate campaign to destroy civilian infrastructure, rendering some cities barely habitable, and an attempt to destroy civilian morale. Both the targeted and indiscriminate attacks carried out by the Russian military against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine are violations of International humanitarian law (IHL) and, per the findings of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, actions by Russian forces amount to war crimes.|

On Friday, the United States said it was sending more aid to Kyiv to strengthen its air defences and defeat drones. The city of Melitopol is seen as the next major objective for Ukrainian forces in the south of the country since Ukraine retook the major city of Kherson. With Ukrainian forces now operating on the east bank of the Dnieper River, opposite Kherson, and with their forces now able to place Himars rocket systems on the west bank, Russian forces in the city have come under an increasing threat.|

"If Melitopol falls, the entire defence line all the way to Kherson collapses," he said in an interview. If that happened, he added, "Ukrainian forces would gain a direct route to Crimea," the peninsula Russia annexed in 2014 and that the Ukrainians have vowed to retake. Elsewhere, the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine came under fresh bombardment on Sunday.|

Video posted online showed two supports of the bridge had been damaged during the attack, just two days after Ukraine hit a Russian barracks sited in a resort in the city, with Himars rockets causing substantial damage and casualties.|
