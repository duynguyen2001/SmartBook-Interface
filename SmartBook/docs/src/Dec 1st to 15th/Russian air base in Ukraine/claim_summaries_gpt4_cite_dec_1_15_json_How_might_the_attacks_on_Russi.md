<template v-slot:summary>
The recent Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian airfields, including those housing nuclear-capable bombers, have demonstrated Ukraine's capability to escalate the conflict and hit targets deep within Russian territory, raising questions about the effectiveness of Russian air defenses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. These attacks may signal a shift in the war's dynamics, as they not only challenge Russia militarily but also carry political implications, reinforcing President Putin's framing of the war as a patriotic struggle for Russia and potentially impacting Moscow's battlefield strategy in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The vulnerability of strategic sites to drone technology has also altered Western perceptions of Russian nuclear threats <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. As the conflict continues through the winter, both nations face decisions that could diplomatically and militarily reshape the confrontation, with the possibility of Putin employing strategic measures he has used effectively in the past <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The recent Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian air bases, including Engels air base and Ryazan, demonstrate Ukraine's capabilities to carry out long-range, high-precision attacks deep inside Russian territory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. These incidents, which utilized modified Soviet-era drones, have raised questions about the effectiveness of Russian air defenses and have the potential to escalate the conflict further <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The strikes not only signify a military challenge for Russia but also carry political implications, reinforcing President Putin's narrative of a patriotic struggle for Russia while posing an immediate strategic problem for Russia's Defense Ministry <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In response to the attacks, there has been no indication from Moscow of a willingness for a "Christmas ceasefire" nor a compromise in peace negotiations, with Russia maintaining its annexation claims and Ukraine refusing to concede any territory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The attacks could also influence the perception of Western leaders regarding Russia's nuclear threats, given the vulnerability of strategic sites to drone technology <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military's ability to strike back provides a morale boost for civilians facing a difficult winter amid the ongoing conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. These developments suggest that the conflict could continue to intensify, with both sides making key decisions that will shape the war both diplomatically and militarily <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="1"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[1]</font> They also threatened a major escalation of the nine-month war.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-1.6675660" target="_blank">CBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| It came a day after Russia confirmed it had been hit by what it said were Soviet-era drones at Engels air base, home to Russia's strategic bomber fleet, and in Ryazan, a few hours' drive from Moscow. The attacks on Russian bases more than 500 kilometres from the border with Ukraine raised questions about the effectiveness of their air defences. They also threatened a major escalation of the nine-month war. One of the airfields houses bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="2"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[2]</font> These attacks represent a serious military challenge for the Kremlin but are also politically convenient.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/times-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/putins-new-strategy-to-win-the-propaganda-war-over-ukraine-invasion-kk52d9j83" target="_blank">The Times</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Long-range Ukrainian drone strikes on air bases hundreds of miles inside Russian territory on Monday and Tuesday demonstrated that Kyiv was willing and able to escalate the war on its own terms. These attacks represent a serious military challenge for the Kremlin but are also politically convenient. They reinforce President Putins new message: that this is a national, patriotic struggle for the survival of the Motherland in which there can be no bystanders or backsliders.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="3"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[3]</font> On December 5, two Ukrainian strikes on Russian air bases deep into Russian territory and far from the frontlines produced a painful shock for Russian forces and could signify a further mutation, if not escalation, of the war.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://blogs.prio.org/2022/12/as-ukraine-conducts-deep-strikes-russia-turns-to-iran/" target="_blank">blogs.prio.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 14th, 2022</div></div>| On December 5, two Ukrainian strikes on Russian air bases deep into Russian territory and far from the frontlines produced a painful shock for Russian forces and could signify a further mutation, if not escalation, of the war. Each time Ukrainian forces deliver a long-range high-precision attack from the sinking of the Moskva cruiser in mid-April 2022 to the strike on Saky air base in Crimea in early August and the swarm attack of air and naval drones on Sevastopol in late October Russia has been caught unprepared and has struggled to find a response.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="4"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Aside from the symbolism of striking airfields linked to Russias nuclear deterrent, the attacks may have immediate effects on Moscows strategy on the battlefield in Ukraine.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/06/ukraine-drones-russian-airfield-attacks/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 6th, 2022</div></div>| Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly alluded to his countrys vast nuclear arsenal, making veiled threats that he is prepared to resort to extreme measures to deter Western involvement in the war or as retaliation if Ukraine targets critical infrastructure inside Russia. The vulnerability of strategic sites to relatively simple drone technology may change the way Western leaders perceive these threats. Aside from the symbolism of striking airfields linked to Russias nuclear deterrent, the attacks may have immediate effects on Moscows strategy on the battlefield in Ukraine. "In the practical sense, this is a serious and imminent problem for the Russian Defense Ministry," Ruslan Leviev, an analyst with Conflict Intelligence Team, said in a daily video briefing.|

Ukraine and Russia both face key decisions that could reshape the conflict diplomatically and militarily. Perhaps the most worrying possibility for Ukraine, and for the US, is that Russian President Vladimir Putin will finally start showing the strategic smarts he has demonstrated in the past.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="6"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Trk, has said that further strikes on Ukraines infrastructure could lead to a serious deterioration of the humanitarian situation and spark further displacement.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-kursk-airbase-in-russia-hit-ukraine-official-claims-canada-resumes-nord-stream-sanctions" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 15th, 2022</div></div>| Moscow has said no "Christmas ceasefire" was on the cards after nearly 10 months of war in Ukraine, with fighting looking set to drag on through the winter. Military analysts say a winter deadlock could now set in, even as fierce fighting continues especially in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, where Russian forces are pushing to capture the town of Bakhmut. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Trk, has said that further strikes on Ukraines infrastructure could lead to a serious deterioration of the humanitarian situation and spark further displacement. In a speech to the human rights council after a trip to Ukraine, Trk said Russian strikes were exposing millions of people to "extreme hardship".|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="7"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[7]</font> For now, Moscow appears to calculate that devastating attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and reminders to Western states of the risks of escalation will combine with rising energy costs across Europe to shift dynamics in its favour.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine/b96-answering-four-hard-questions-about-russias-war-ukraine" target="_blank">crisisgroup.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 8th, 2022</div></div>| Russia, although complaining about Ukrainian unwillingness to negotiate, also is not in the market for compromise. Rather, Moscow appears to want only deals that cement its gains and, ideally, more: that is, to maintain its position in the south and east, if not take full control of all four territories that it claims to have annexed. For now, Moscow appears to calculate that devastating attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and reminders to Western states of the risks of escalation will combine with rising energy costs across Europe to shift dynamics in its favour. It may hope that the slim majority the Republican Party now enjoys in the U.S. House of Representatives, and particularly its faction that opposes aid to Ukraine, will erode political support for U.S. assistance.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="8"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The government in Kyiv has ruled out conceding any land to Russia in return for peace.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.fbcnews.com.fj/world/zelenskiys-talks-with-other-leaders-signal-diplomatic-flurry-around-ukraine/" target="_blank">fbcnews.com.fj</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| There are no peace talks and no end in sight to the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two, which Moscow calls a "special military operation" and Ukraine and its allies an unprovoked act of aggression. Moscow shows no signs of being ready to respect Ukraines sovereignty and pre-war borders, saying the four regions it claims to have annexed from Ukraine in September are part of Russia "forever." The government in Kyiv has ruled out conceding any land to Russia in return for peace. On the ground in Ukraine, the entire eastern front line has been continuously shelled with heavy fighting taking place.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="9"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[9]</font> The attacks on the air bases were a significant blow to Kremlin, as they marked the first time Ukraine had conducted such long-range strikes inside Russia.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.eurasiantimes.com/gaping-holes-in-air-defense-kremlin-expert-warns-of-strike/" target="_blank">eurasiantimes.com</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 12th, 2022</div></div>| On December 5, Ukrainian forces struck Engels-2 and Dyagilevo Air Force Bases, which are located very close to the Russian capital city of Moscow than the borders with Ukraine. The strikes were reportedly carried out using a modified Soviet-era unmanned aerial vehicle called the Tu-141 Strizh. The attacks on the air bases were a significant blow to Kremlin, as they marked the first time Ukraine had conducted such long-range strikes inside Russia. However, the Ukrainians did not stop there.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="10"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Analysts were cautious about the military impact of the apparent attacks on strategic sites far from the front lines, but said they had further undermined Russian confidence in the country's air defenses while providing a timely morale boost for Ukrainian civilians preparing for a long winter under bombardment.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukrainian-drone-attacks-russia-airbases-kursk-putin-war-what-it-means-rcna60276" target="_blank">NBC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility, but officials have jokingly suggested its military may be behind the incidents. Russias defense ministry blamed Kyivs forces for the two blasts Monday, in which it said three "maintenance personnel" died and two planes were damaged. Analysts were cautious about the military impact of the apparent attacks on strategic sites far from the front lines, but said they had further undermined Russian confidence in the country's air defenses while providing a timely morale boost for Ukrainian civilians preparing for a long winter under bombardment. "The signaling is important for the Ukrainians: They need to know that they are hitting back, given the amount of pain and devastation and general discomfort thats being meted out in Ukraine," Matthew Ford, an associate professor at the Swedish Defense University in Stockholm, told NBC News.|
