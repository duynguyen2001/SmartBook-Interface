## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian airfields Engels-2 and Dyagilevo, which house Russia's strategic bomber fleet, have raised serious concerns about the effectiveness of Russia's air defenses and demonstrated Ukraine's capability to strike deep within Russian territory, potentially impacting Russia's strategic bomber operations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The attacks reportedly resulted in casualties and damage to at least one of the bombers, highlighting a significant blow to the Kremlin's assumptions of security for its military assets in the country's interior <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Ukrainian forces carried out unprecedented strikes on Engels-2 and Dyagilevo Air Force Bases using a Soviet-era unmanned aerial vehicle, impacting the strategic bomber capabilities of Russia by demonstrating the vulnerability of its interior military installations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The attacks marked a significant blow to the Kremlin, as they challenged the assumption that Russia could protect its deep interior and maintain safe harbors for its strategic bombers, which have been used to launch attacks on Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Although Russian defenses claimed to have intercepted the drones, there was still loss of life and some damage to the aircraft, including a Backfire bomber, indicating that the strikes had a tangible impact on Russian military assets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The incidents have raised questions about the effectiveness of Russian air defenses and represent a potential major escalation in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
On December 5, Ukrainian forces allegedly conducted drone strikes on two Russian airbases, Engels-2 and Dyagilevo, using modified Soviet-era Tu-141 unmanned aerial vehicles. These attacks, which are reported to have occurred hundreds of kilometers inside Russian territory, represent a significant escalation, as they targeted facilities far from the front lines and close to Moscow <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that the drone attacks resulted in the deaths of at least three Russian servicemen and caused damage to two Tu-95 strategic bombers, though they claimed the drones were shot down and the damage to the aircraft was superficial <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. This marks the first time Ukraine has directly hit Russian bombers that have been attacking Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and energy grid <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The implications of these strikes for Russia's strategic bomber capabilities are twofold. Firstly, the attacks have raised serious questions about the effectiveness of Russian air defenses, particularly as they occurred at bases that are considered to be well within the interior of the country and previously thought to be beyond the reach of Ukrainian capabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Secondly, while the material damage to the strategic bombers might be ambiguous, the attacks have undoubtedly had a psychological impact, undermining Russian confidence in their air defense and providing a morale boost for Ukrainian forces and civilians <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Additionally, the attacks signal a potential shift in Ukrainian strategy, demonstrating an ability to strike at key military assets deep within Russian territory, which could force Russia to reassess the security of their strategic assets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

The strikes were reportedly carried out using a modified Soviet-era unmanned aerial vehicle called the Tu-141 Strizh. The attacks on the air bases were a significant blow to Kremlin, as they marked the first time Ukraine had conducted such long-range strikes inside Russia. However, the Ukrainians did not stop there.|

The strikes are an extraordinary breach of Russias assumptions that it can protect its deep interior, from which safe harbors its strategic bombers have caused carnage across Ukraine with relative impunity. These are airbases very far inside Russia, and whatever the truth of the strikes whether they represent a new long-distance drone capability Ukraine has advertised, or theres another explanation this is just not something that was meant to happen when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his "10-day invasion" in February.|

The Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) claimed that Ukraine used converted Soviet-era Tu-141 jet-powered unmanned aerial vehicles to prosecute the attacks, but that the drones were intercepted by Russian air defenses. Nevertheless, the attacks have caused some loss of life, and reportedly damaged one of the Backfires, although the extent of the material damage remains ambiguous for now.

Russia accused Ukraine of using a drone to strike Russian targets hundreds of kilometers from the border at Engels Airport in the Saratov region and Dyagilevo Airbase in Ryazan. The Russian Defense Ministry stated that drone attacks had killed three people, adding that the drones were "shot down as they flew in at low altitude," and the resulting explosions led to some superficial aircraft damage. The Kremlin-owned RIA Novosti news agency also reported a fuel explosion at an airfield outside Ryazan.|

It came a day after Russia confirmed it had been hit by what it said were Soviet-era drones at Engels air base, home to Russia's strategic bomber fleet, and in Ryazan, a few hours' drive from Moscow. The attacks on Russian bases more than 500 kilometres from the border with Ukraine raised questions about the effectiveness of their air defences. They also threatened a major escalation of the nine-month war.|

Zelenskyy said the Russian attacks had also killed four people Monday. Russias defense ministry claimed the drone attacks on its airbases had failed to disrupt the planned strikes, claiming they had destroyed 17 targets. The airbase explosions, nonetheless, were a significant shift, marking the first time Ukraine has sought to hit the bombers that for months have regularly attacked its civilian infrastructure with impunity and recently sought to bring its energy grid to its knees.|

Russias defense ministry blamed Kyivs forces for the two blasts Monday, in which it said three "maintenance personnel" died and two planes were damaged. Analysts were cautious about the military impact of the apparent attacks on strategic sites far from the front lines, but said they had further undermined Russian confidence in the country's air defenses while providing a timely morale boost for Ukrainian civilians preparing for a long winter under bombardment. "The signaling is important for the Ukrainians: They need to know that they are hitting back, given the amount of pain and devastation and general discomfort thats being meted out in Ukraine," Matthew Ford, an associate professor at the Swedish Defense University in Stockholm, told NBC News.|

These attacks represent a serious military challenge for the Kremlin but are also politically convenient. They reinforce President Putins new message: that this is a national, patriotic struggle for the survival of the Motherland in which there can be no bystanders or backsliders.|

"As a result of the fall and explosion at the Russian airfields of the wreckage of [the] jet drones, the skin of two aircraft was slightly damaged," it said. Ukraine has not confirmed that it attacked either airfield. Recent satellite imagery shows a substantial number of Russian strategic bombers at the Engels airbase in Saratov.|
