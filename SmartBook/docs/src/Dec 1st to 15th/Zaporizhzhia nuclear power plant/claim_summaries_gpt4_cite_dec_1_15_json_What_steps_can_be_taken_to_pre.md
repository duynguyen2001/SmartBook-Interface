To prevent the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from being exploited in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Ukrainian Prime Minister Shmygal has highlighted the need for "demilitarization" of the site, considering it a priority for Ukrainian leadership <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), led by Rafael Grossi, has been working towards establishing a safety zone around the plant, which is critical as the plant is not designed to survive direct military attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Grossi has also engaged in discussions with both Ukrainian and Russian officials, including meeting with President Putin, to negotiate an agreement on the protection of the plant, which would involve the withdrawal of armaments <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The IAEA's mission includes securing the plants and monitoring any external attempts to influence them, such as shelling, to prevent a nuclear accident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been actively involved in trying to secure the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control, and to prevent it from becoming a point of leverage or a strategic military asset in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict. IAEA teams are set to deploy to various nuclear plants in Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, to monitor for any external attempts to influence them, such as shelling, which has been attributed to Russian aggression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has held meetings with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the demilitarization of the nuclear plant and the establishment of a safety zone around it, recognizing that the IAEA's involvement is the only viable way forward <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Moreover, Grossi has stressed the importance of maintaining the plant's electricity supply for cooling and emergency systems, despite periodic attacks on the electrical grid <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>To further mitigate the risks, both Ukrainian and Russian officials have called for measures to ensure the plant's security. Shmygal reiterated Ukraine's call for the plant's demilitarization as a priority for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, while Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has accused Ukraine of shelling the plant and has declared that Russian forces are taking all necessary measures to ensure its safety <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. In the broader context of the conflict, there have been calls for continued diplomatic engagement, with French President Emmanuel Macron emphasizing the need to pressure Russia to return to negotiations and to prevent escalation around civilian nuclear power <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Additionally, efforts to manage nuclear safety risks through international cooperation, such as prisoner exchanges and grain passage deals, have been suggested as ways to lessen the conflict's impact while maintaining focus on the critical issue of nuclear safety at Zaporizhzhia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking "all measures" to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europes largest, in the face of what he called "nuclear terrorism" from Kyiv. Russias defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> As for the Ukrainian side, Grossi said: "The withdrawal of armaments from the plant is what, understandably from their point of view, the Ukrainians are demanding.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-12-05-22/h_ecbcd4bbb91d9f945609160725819964" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 5th, 2022</div></div>| The second is the recognition that the IAEA is the only possible way forward: that was the heart of my meeting with President Putin in St. Petersburg on October 11." "Russia is not against an agreement and the principle of protecting the plant," he added. As for the Ukrainian side, Grossi said: "The withdrawal of armaments from the plant is what, understandably from their point of view, the Ukrainians are demanding. And it would still be part of the overall agreement."|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> The U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency is trying to establish a safety zone around the plant because while nuclear power plants are built to withstand many natural disasters, few are designed to survive direct military attacks, said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/usa-today-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/12/08/nuclear-disaster-russian-war-explained/8092631001/" target="_blank">USA TODAY Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 8th, 2022</div></div>| A leak from Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is among the highest risk, experts told USA TODAY, because Russia has deliberately targeted the area. Zaporizhzhia is Europe's largest nuclear power station and has been under Russian control since shortly after the invasion. The U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency is trying to establish a safety zone around the plant because while nuclear power plants are built to withstand many natural disasters, few are designed to survive direct military attacks, said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists. An attack on the plant could potentially release intense radiation in a small area and weaker radioactive particles over a wider area.|

Asked who was responsible for those strikes, Grossi said, "It is not my job to assign responsibility. For me the important thing is to avoid a nuclear accident and reach the agreement, not to be a judge." He also spoke about three other nuclear plants in Ukraine: Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Whilst we can assume that Macrons recent comments are probably caused by his fear that not providing any security guarantees to Russia may lead to escalations in the future, making such comments is not prudent.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1705741/ukraine-live-russia-latest-angels-save-pows" target="_blank">express.co.uk</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 7th, 2022</div></div>| According to Henry Jackson Society's Associate Research Fellow Dr Helena Ivanov, the French leader's comments could risk the security of Western allies as she warned Vladimir Putin could use them as a way to divide the West further. She told Express.co.uk: "Macrons comments obviously carry great significance given Frances role in the EU and what this means for the overall EU approach to Russias invasion of Ukraine. Whilst we can assume that Macrons recent comments are probably caused by his fear that not providing any security guarantees to Russia may lead to escalations in the future, making such comments is not prudent. "For one, such comments are likely to provide Putin and his supporters more leverage in making further demands.|

He claimed that most were intercepted by Russian air defenses, but added that "some still hit objects that affect the safe operation of the nuclear power plant." The minister said that Russian forces were taking "all measures" to ensure the safety of the power plant in the face of Kyivs alleged attacks, which Moscow sees as "nuclear terrorism." Ukraine denies targeting the facility, which has been under the control of Russian forces since the beginning of the invasion.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Both Kyiv and the West should continue to look for areas where cooperation can blunt the wars effects for example, prisoner exchanges, efforts to sustain and extend the deal that provides safe passage for Ukrainian grain across the Black Sea, and arrangements to manage nuclear safety risks at Ukraines Zaporizhzhia power plant.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine/b96-answering-four-hard-questions-about-russias-war-ukraine" target="_blank">crisisgroup.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 8th, 2022</div></div>| The West, and Washington in particular, should keep the door open to talks. They should continue to make sure that Kyiv does not set impossible preconditions; avoid regime change rhetoric that would deter Kremlin engagement; and signal that a reasonable peace will lead to sanctions relief. Both Kyiv and the West should continue to look for areas where cooperation can blunt the wars effects for example, prisoner exchanges, efforts to sustain and extend the deal that provides safe passage for Ukrainian grain across the Black Sea, and arrangements to manage nuclear safety risks at Ukraines Zaporizhzhia power plant. But calling for peace talks when both parties see more to gain on the battlefield, and neither is ready to compromise, is almost certain to be fruitless.|

After this period, the plant is in serious danger." Most people in Ukraines energy sector do not believe Russia would try to attack or seize any nuclear plants without ensuring it has access to energy to continue cooling. A government insider speaking on the condition of anonymity said: "Russia isnt that stupid.|

According to Macron, both countries are united in their desire to see an end to the conflict. "I will talk again to President Putin after having had the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency," he said, adding that the most important thing was "to ensure that there is no escalation on civilian nuclear power", as fighting around the Zaporizhzhia power plant raises fears of a nuclear disaster. "We must do everything to put pressure on Russia to return to the negotiating table", Macron said, adding that, ultimately, it is up to the Ukrainian people to decide the way forward and the agenda.|
