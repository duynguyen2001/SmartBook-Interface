## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The US's unwavering support for Ukraine, including financial aid and backing for international accountability mechanisms, reinforces Ukraine's negotiating position and complicates Russia's strategic options, potentially pushing Russia towards negotiations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. However, President Biden's readiness to talk with Putin only under the condition of Russia's interest in ending the war, along with the US's non-recognition of annexed Ukrainian regions, presents a significant hurdle for diplomatic engagement <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

The United States' non-recognition of the annexed Ukrainian regions complicates potential talks between the US and Russia, as acknowledged by Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov, indicating challenges in finding mutual grounds for discussion <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. President Biden's stance on the war, calling for Putin to withdraw from Ukraine and expressing readiness to negotiate only under certain conditions, reflects a firm US position that may influence Russia's strategic decisions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, the US, along with international allies like France, continues to provide substantial financial and military support to Ukraine and to uphold international obligations, which could pressure Russia towards accountability and potentially impact its willingness to engage in negotiations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The combined efforts to hold Russia accountable for war crimes through various international mechanisms may further reinforce the US's strategic influence over Russia's decision-making process <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The US's unwavering support for Ukraine is significantly shaping the geopolitical landscape, particularly influencing Russia's strategic decisions and its potential readiness to enter negotiations. President Biden's firm stance, describing Putin's actions as "sick" and stating the only rational way to end the war would be for Russia to withdraw, underscores the US's commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This position is reinforced by the provision of robust direct budget support and urging international financial institutions to enhance their support for Ukraine. France and the US also emphasize the importance of holding Russia accountable for atrocities and war crimes, further indicating the high costs that Russia could continue to face if it persists with the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Additionally, the US has expressed its readiness to engage in diplomacy, a sentiment echoed by French President Macron, who is open to speaking with Putin once Ukraine sets the conditions for a peace agreement <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>However, the Kremlin has indicated that the lack of recognition by Washington of the annexed Ukrainian regions as part of Russia complicates the possibility of any discussions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Putin's defense of his actions in Ukraine and assertion that the West's support for Kyiv negates the prospects of negotiations demonstrate a current unwillingness to consider diplomatic resolutions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The US's strategy, which echoes Cold War-era tactics, aims to impose exorbitant costs on Russia for its aggression, potentially forcing a reconsideration of its military strategy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The combined diplomatic pressure from the US and its allies, along with the consistent military, economic, and humanitarian support for Ukraine, contributes to a strategic environment where Russia may have to weigh the sustainability of its campaign against the escalating costs and international isolation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

In September, Moscow illegally declared four Ukrainian regions to be Russian territory: Luhansk and Donetsk -- home to two Russian-backed breakaway republics where fighting has been ongoing since 2014 -- as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, two areas in southern Ukraine that had been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began.|

Biden added that he had no immediate plans to contact Putin, but is "prepared to speak" with the Russian leader "if in fact there is aninterest in him deciding he'slooking for a way to end thewar he hasn't done that yet." He continued, "If that's the case, inconsultation with my French andmy NATO friends, I'll be happyto sit down with Putin to seewhat he wants, has in mind.He hasn't done that yet.In the meantime, I think it'sabsolutely critical whatEmmanuel [Macron] said.We must support the Ukrainianpeople."|

The rejection of talks with Washington came as Putin provided a forceful defense of his actions in Ukraine in a phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. According to a Kremlin readout of the call, Putin said the West is pursuing "destructive" policies in Ukraine through its financial and military support, which "leads to the fact that Kyiv has dismissed the idea of any negotiations." Putin defended weeks of attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure as a logical response to Ukrainian attacks on Russia including a key bridge linking the Russian mainland to the annexed Crimean Peninsula.|

There has been in recent weeks conversations or increasing noise around diplomatic diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. The U.S. has said very clearly that that is a decision for Ukraine to take under the conditions that Ukraine has put forward, including around territorial integrity, including further guarantees that Russia would not pursue a fraught fall on engagement invasion. And we've heard, of course, that President Macron is at for his side that perhaps in closed door session that he's more open to diplomatic route.|

The United States and France reiterate their duty to uphold applicable international obligations and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter.

The French leader told ABC's "Good Morning America" earlier Thursday that he intends to speak with the Russian president in the coming days. Firm US support, Macron also relayed, "is very important, not just for the Ukrainians but for the stability of our world today. Because if we consider that we can abandon the country and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means that there is no possible stability in this world," pledging France's own increased military, economic, and humanitarian support.|

"We are just thinking about it.|

Chorev said the US shared the belief of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, South Africa and most others that the war would eventually have to end with diplomacy. "Unfortunately and tragically, President Putin has [shown] no willingness and seriousness to engage in diplomacy," he said. "And the aggression weve seen from the Russian government, its bombardment of civilian infrastructure, the war crimes that it has left in its wake every place it has left in Ukraine, make clear that unfortunately Russia is not prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy."|

Moreover, bloodletting allows a state to wage a proxy conflict at very little cost to itself (while increasing the adversarys costs), thereby undermining an adversary without spilling much blood and treasure. Bloodletting is certainly not new for the U.S.indeed, US policymakers pursued these strategies vis--vis the Soviet Union during the Cold War, including by supporting the Afghan mujahideen in their fight against the Soviet invaders during the Soviet-Afghan War. However, like the Spider-Man movies, this strategy needs a reboot for the 21st century.|

Evidently determined to present a united front during a White House news conference that at times resembled a love fest, Mr. Macron said that France would increase its military support for Ukraine and "will never urge Ukrainians to make a compromise that will not be acceptable for them." In effect, the two leaders met each other halfway, with Mr. Biden showing more openness to a negotiated settlement and Mr. Macron more unequivocal support for the Ukrainian cause. If partially choreographed, the meeting of minds appeared to exceed expectations on both sides.|
