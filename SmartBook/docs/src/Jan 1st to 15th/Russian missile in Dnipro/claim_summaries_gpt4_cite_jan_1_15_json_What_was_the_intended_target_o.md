## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The intended target of the Russian missile strike on the apartment block in Dnipro is unclear, as the building was some distance from the nearest power facility, which suggests the possibility of missile inaccuracy or interception by Ukrainian air defenses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Ukrainian officials have not provided specific details on why the residential building was hit during a wider attack primarily focused on Ukraine's energy infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Russian missile strike that destroyed a section of an apartment building in Dnipro resulted in the death of at least nine people, including a 15-year-old girl, and the injury of 64 others <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Although the exact reason for targeting this particular building is unclear, it was suggested that the missile may have been one of the less accurate ones in Russia's arsenal, or possibly intercepted by Ukraine's air defenses, as the building is located some distance from the nearest power facility <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The attack was part of a larger offensive that targeted multiple Ukrainian regions, including Kharkiv, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Odesa, and the capital Kyiv, with the apparent intent of disrupting Ukraine's energy infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. However, Ukrainian officials have not confirmed the building as a deliberate military target, and Russia's broader strategy seemed to focus on crippling Ukraine's power grid during the attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

On January 14, Russia launched a massive missile strike against Ukraine, which resulted in the destruction of a nine-story apartment block in the city of Dnipro, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens more. The attack not only caused significant loss of life, including a 15-year-old girl, but also trapped others under the rubble of the destroyed building <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Despite the devastation, the reason behind the targeting of this residential building remains unclear. Officials have not provided information on why the building was hit, as it was located some distance from the nearest power facility, which suggests that it may not have been the intended target. This has led to speculations that the missile could have been one of the less accurate ones in Russia's arsenal or possibly intercepted by Ukraine's air defenses, although the latter seems less likely <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The missile strike in Dnipro occurred amid wider attacks across Ukraine, with infrastructure facilities also hit in the western Lviv region, Ivano-Frankivsk regions, the Odesa region on the Black Sea, northeastern Kharkiv, and the capital Kyiv <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The widespread assault on Ukraine's energy grid and other critical infrastructure has been a persistent strategy, with Russia launching waves of drone and missile attacks since New Year's Eve, mainly targeting these critical services. The attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure, which have cast cities into darkness and cold, are claimed by Moscow to be aimed at reducing Ukraine's ability to fight, while Kyiv decries them as having no military purpose and accuses Russia of intending to harm civilians, a war crime <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
