## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The significant losses suffered by the Wagner Group in Soledar, including over a thousand personnel in a single month, indicate heavy attrition that may force Russia to alter its military tactics due to the need to replenish its forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The costly toll of the fighting on the group, which comprises a large portion of Russia's deployed personnel in Ukraine, could lead to a reassessment of the strategic value of objectives like Bakhmut given the high price of achieving them <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
The heavy casualties sustained by the Wagner Group in Soledar, reported to be over 1,000 personnel in a month, indicate a costly war of attrition for Russian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These losses, predominantly of former prisoners, suggest that the Wagner Group may need to replenish its forces, which could impact their ability to sustain offensive operations and influence Russian military tactics <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The importance of taking Bakhmut, which could be made more precarious by the fall of Soledar, has been downplayed by experts like Michael Kofman, who argue that the outcome may not justify the high cost to Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the significant number of Wagner personnel deployed in Ukraine, including convicts, points to a strategy that might increasingly rely on high-risk, high-casualty operations that could prove as deadly for Russia as a defeat <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The heavy casualties sustained by the Wagner Group in Soledar could have significant implications for future Russian military tactics. The high number of casualties, including those among recruited convicts, indicates a costly war of attrition that may affect the Wagner Group's operational capabilities and necessitate replenishment of its forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. With over 1,000 Wagner personnel reported dead in a month, and a strategy that has led to a high number of casualties being observed on the ground, the tactics employed by the Wagner Group may need to be reevaluated to mitigate such heavy losses in future operations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the toll on the Wagner Group, which is a significant component of the Russian offensive, contributes to the overall degradation of combat power and cumulative exhaustion of Russian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. This attrition may force a strategic reassessment, as even small territorial gains are proving to be enormously costly. The battle for Soledar itself is described as potentially a Pyrrhic victory for Russia, implying that the heavy losses could make subsequent military endeavors more challenging and potentially unsustainable <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Analysts suggest that the capture of Soledar will not have a strategic impact on the broader war due to the disproportionate costs associated with such gains <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

After the Russian retreat from Kherson in the south, the focus of the war moved east through the winter to waves of Russian attacks and artillery battles against Ukrainian positions. The capture of Soledar would serve a military purpose while not constituting a turning point in the war, analysts said. It could also fulfil a personal goal of bolstering Prigozhins growing reputation.|

The United States Kyivs foremost ally has said a Russian victory in Soledar or even Bakhmut, a city 10 times larger where the Russians have so far been repelled, would mean little for the overall trajectory of the war. "Even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, its not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself, and it certainly isnt going to stop the Ukrainians or slow them down," John Kirby, spokesperson for the US National Security Council, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. The Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank in Washington, DC also said the towns fall would not be "an operationally significant development and is unlikely to presage an imminent Russian encirclement of Bakhmut".|

He described the situation as "very challenging." The tactics employed by the Wagner Group have resulted in a high number of casualties. In recent days, reporters for The New York Times embedded with a Ukrainian drone crew on the front line saw the bodies of Russian fighters scattered across open ground in the area around Bakhmut.|

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said in an analysis on Thursday that geolocated footage indicated that Moscows forces "likely control most if not all of Soledar" but called the capture "at best a Russian Pyrrhic tactical victory" after Moscow had committed significant resources. It added that the battle will have contributed to "Russian forces degraded combat power and cumulative exhaustion." The White Houses national security spokesman, John Kirby, echoed those sentiments on Thursday when asked about the status of Soledar, cautioning that it was important to "keep this in perspective."|

Three particular lessons stand out. First, even small territorial gains are enormously costly in personnel and materiel, and they are only achievable after protracted fighting that inflicts significant losses on both sides and ties up substantial resources. If Russia is eventually able to capture Soledar, it will do so only after razing the town to the ground.|
