# How might Ukrainian defense and counter-offensive strategies change following the situation in Soledar?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Despite the unclear outcome in Soledar, where Ukraine denies Russian claims of capturing the town, Ukrainian forces may need to adapt their strategies to reinforce their defenses and prevent encirclement of key locations like Bakhmut <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The recent history of Ukrainian counter-offensives regaining territory, including the successful recapture of land in the northeast and withdrawal from Kherson, suggests a potential for Ukraine to launch strategic counter-attacks following the Soledar situation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
The battle for Soledar has been intense, with Russia claiming to have captured the town, a claim that Ukraine denies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The town's strategic value lies in its potential to help Russian forces encircle Bakhmut and advance from the north, which could alter the dynamics of the conflict in the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Given the Ukrainian armed forces' denial of Soledar's capture and their recent successes in counteroffensives, such as the recapture of territory in the northeast and the orderly withdrawal from Kherson <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>, Ukrainian defense strategies may continue to focus on containing Russian advances and reclaiming occupied areas. Moreover, with General Surovikin's shift of Russian military tactics to a more defensive stance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>, Ukrainian forces might adapt their strategies to exploit the current stalemate and further consolidate their defenses while preparing for potential counter-offensives.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The situation in Soledar has been marked by competing claims over control, with Russia announcing the capture of the town, a claim Ukraine denies, amid fierce ongoing fighting <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Despite Russian assertions, capturing Soledar is seen as having minimal strategic military significance; however, it would provide Moscow's forces, specifically the Wagner mercenary group, with new positions to pressure Ukrainian defenses and potentially encircle Bakhmut from the north, putting pressure on Ukrainian supply lines <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The town's fall would allow Russian forces to focus more on Bakhmut, which has been a significant target since the summer, but even then, the overall trajectory of the war is not expected to be altered significantly by the capture of Soledar or Bakhmut <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In response to the situation in Soledar and the possibility of Russian advancements, Ukraine is rearming for a planned counter-offensive to reclaim territory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The United States, a key ally, and other analysts maintain that even if Soledar and Bakhmut were to fall, it would not have a strategic impact on the war, nor would it impede the Ukrainian counter-offensive efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Consequently, Ukrainian defense and counter-offensive strategies might see a continuation of their current trajectory, focusing on strengthening their positions and preparing for future operations to push back Russian forces, without allowing the situation in Soledar to dictate a significant shift in their overall military strategy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

## Claims

Seizing nearby Soledar, a town about 15km (six miles) away, would help Moscows forces encircle Bakhmut and attack from a new direction in the north. Conflicting reports make the situation in Soledar unclear, as Russian officials say the town has been captured, while Ukraines leadership says fierce fighting is continuing. Described as one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war, Moscows capture of Soledar would be a significant victory following substantial battlefield setbacks throughout the second half of 2022.|

The capture of Soledar would represent a symbolic if not an especially strategic win for Putin after a long string of military setbacks dating back to last summer. But it does not suggest a significant capitulation of Ukrainian forces, nor a substantial change to the overall complexion of the war. Ukraines armed forces have denied Moscows claim.|

Capturing Soledar, which had a pre-war population of 10,000, could improve the position of Russian forces as they push towards what has been their main target since October, the nearby transport crossroads of Bakhmut. Russia said on Friday that its forces had taken control of the town, but Ukraine has denied the claim. Al Jazeeras Charles Stratford, reporting from near Soledar, said there was no obvious sign of a Ukrainian withdrawal from the town.|

The retreat from the only regional center captured by Russia since it sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 came weeks after its annexation by Moscow and dealt a painful blow to the Kremlin. Under Surovikin, the Russian military largely switched to a defensive mode, allowing it to reduce the military failures that had characterized the first half year of the war. He was able to conduct an orderly retreat from the southern city of Kherson, the only Ukrainian provincial capital captured by Russian forces in nearly a year since the invasion.|

His appointment came after the Ukrainians recovered thousands of square miles of territory in a lightning counteroffensive in the northeast of the country. Under General Surovikin, the Russian military largely switched to a defensive mode, allowing it to reduce the military failures that had characterized the first half year of the war. He was able to conduct an orderly retreat from the southern city of Kherson, the only Ukrainian provincial capital captured by Russian forces in nearly a year since the invasion.|

After the Russian retreat from Kherson in the south, the focus of the war moved east through the winter to waves of Russian attacks and artillery battles against Ukrainian positions. The capture of Soledar would serve a military purpose while not constituting a turning point in the war, analysts said. It could also fulfil a personal goal of bolstering Prigozhins growing reputation.|

Russia said the capture of Soledar was"important for the continuation of successful offensive operations in the Donetsk region." It added that "establishing control over Soledar makes it possible to cut off the supply routes for Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut." The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal.|

The battle has put into sharp relief Russias costly and grinding offensive in eastern Ukraine as it attempts to take the nearby city of Bakhmut, part of its goal of controlling the entire Donbas region. Seizing Soledar is not expected to quickly change the battle in the east, but it would give Moscows forces new locations to place artillery and the potential to partially encircle Bakhmut from the north. It could put pressure on Ukrainian supply lines that run toward the city.|

The United States Kyivs foremost ally has said a Russian victory in Soledar or even Bakhmut, a city 10 times larger where the Russians have so far been repelled, would mean little for the overall trajectory of the war. "Even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, its not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself, and it certainly isnt going to stop the Ukrainians or slow them down," John Kirby, spokesperson for the US National Security Council, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. The Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank in Washington, DC also said the towns fall would not be "an operationally significant development and is unlikely to presage an imminent Russian encirclement of Bakhmut".|
