The capture of Soledar by Russian forces could have tactical implications for the war in the Donetsk region by potentially allowing Moscow's forces to encircle Bakhmut and attack from new directions, thereby disrupting Ukrainian supply lines <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite the significance of such a development, Ukrainian authorities dispute Russia's claim of capturing the town, maintaining that fierce fighting continues <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. While the fall of Soledar is not seen as a turning point in the war, it could make the defense of Bakhmut more precarious for Ukrainian forces and enable Russian troops to focus on this strategic target <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, the heavy casualties involved in the battle suggest that even if Russia's victory in Soledar is confirmed, it might be as costly as a defeat in terms of personnel and equipment losses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The capture of Soledar by Russian forces has been reported, marking what could be considered Moscow's first significant victory in months, although Ukraine has denied this claim <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The importance of Soledar lies in its potential to facilitate Russian military operations in the region by cutting off Ukrainian supply routes to Bakhmut and allowing Russian forces, including the Wagner mercenary group, to focus on this strategic target <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The town itself, while not a major strategic point, offers a symbolic victory and could serve to improve morale for Russian forces and the reputation of the Wagner group after a series of setbacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Despite the contested reports on the ground, the fall of Soledar to Russian control, if confirmed, could affect the tactical dynamics in the Donetsk region by making the defense of Bakhmut more precarious for Ukrainian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The potential shift in control could allow Russian forces to approach Bakhmut from a new direction, possibly leading to further Ukrainian casualties and challenging their positions in key strongholds such as Kramatorsk and Sloviansk <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Both sides have reportedly suffered heavy losses, and while the capture of Soledar might not signal a turning point in the war, it could signify a change in momentum or at least provide a tactical advantage to Russian operations in the east <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

## Claims
| Claim Sentence | Source | Context |
|---|---|---|
|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> But it does not suggest a significant capitulation of Ukrainian forces, nor a substantial change to the overall complexion of the war.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/13/europe/russians-capture-soledar-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 13th, 2023</div></div>| Russia said Friday its forces had taken the small town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine following weeks of fierce fighting, in what would be Moscows first notable victory in months, although Ukraine denied the claim. The capture of Soledar would represent a symbolic if not an especially strategic win for Putin after a long string of military setbacks dating back to last summer. But it does not suggest a significant capitulation of Ukrainian forces, nor a substantial change to the overall complexion of the war. Ukraines armed forces have denied Moscows claim.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Conflicting reports make the situation in Soledar unclear, as Russian officials say the town has been captured, while Ukraines leadership says fierce fighting is continuing.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/14/fierce-clashes-in-bakhmut-after-russia-seizes-soledar-in-ukraine" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Jan 14th, 2023</div></div>| Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battle for the city, with Moscow desperate to sell any win back home after repeated humiliations and Ukraine determined to win back occupied territory. Seizing nearby Soledar, a town about 15km (six miles) away, would help Moscows forces encircle Bakhmut and attack from a new direction in the north. Conflicting reports make the situation in Soledar unclear, as Russian officials say the town has been captured, while Ukraines leadership says fierce fighting is continuing. Described as one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war, Moscows capture of Soledar would be a significant victory following substantial battlefield setbacks throughout the second half of 2022.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> The capture of Soledar would serve a military purpose while not constituting a turning point in the war, analysts said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-claims-control-soledar-eastern-ukraine-putin-success-rcna65240" target="_blank">NBC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The town lies in the eastern Donetsk region, one of four that Putin claimed to have annexed last year despite failing to fully control. After the Russian retreat from Kherson in the south, the focus of the war moved east through the winter to waves of Russian attacks and artillery battles against Ukrainian positions. The capture of Soledar would serve a military purpose while not constituting a turning point in the war, analysts said. It could also fulfil a personal goal of bolstering Prigozhins growing reputation.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> The costly war of attrition, with expected heavy casualties, may make Russias victory as costly as a defeat, however.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/voice-america" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/latest-developments-in-ukraine-jan-11/6913342.html" target="_blank">Voice of America (VOA)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Jan 11th, 2023</div></div>| Taking Bakhmut would disrupt Ukraines supply lines and open a route for Russian forces to press toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, key Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk. Soledars fall would make "holding Bakhmut much more precarious for Ukraine," Michael Kofman, the director of Russia Studies at the CAN nonprofit research organization in Arlington, Virginia, noted Wednesday. The costly war of attrition, with expected heavy casualties, may make Russias victory as costly as a defeat, however. 6:15 a.m.:|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-1-13-23/h_e9b47e51554e95c246cb8a37d7f8cb3a" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 13th, 2023</div></div>| Russia said the capture of Soledar was"important for the continuation of successful offensive operations in the Donetsk region." It added that "establishing control over Soledar makes it possible to cut off the supply routes for Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut." The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal. However, its capture would allow Russian forces, and especiallythe Wagner mercenary group, to turn their focus on nearby Bakhmut, which has been a target since the summer.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Russia said on Friday that its forces had taken control of the town, but Ukraine has denied the claim.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/14/most-difficult-situation-in-kharkiv-and-kyiv-regions-zelenskyy" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Jan 14th, 2023</div></div>| Saturdays attacks came as Ukrainian and Russian forces battled for control of Soledar, a small salt-mining town in eastern Ukraine that for days has been the focus of a relentless Russian assault. Capturing Soledar, which had a pre-war population of 10,000, could improve the position of Russian forces as they push towards what has been their main target since October, the nearby transport crossroads of Bakhmut. Russia said on Friday that its forces had taken control of the town, but Ukraine has denied the claim. Al Jazeeras Charles Stratford, reporting from near Soledar, said there was no obvious sign of a Ukrainian withdrawal from the town.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Reuters could not immediately verify the situation.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-mercenary-boss-courts-putin-with-ukrainian-battlefield-success-2023-01-13/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 13th, 2023</div></div>| His aim is to leverage the success that Wagner Group, his mercenary outfit, had this week in pushing Ukrainian forces out of the salt mining town of Soledar, a move that revives Russian plans to seize more of eastern Ukraine after multiple defeats. Russia claimed victory on Friday, but Ukraine said on Saturday its troops were still battling to hold the town, though open source analysts said its forces had probably been pushed to its edge or out altogether. Reuters could not immediately verify the situation. Prigozhin, 61, who is sanctioned in the West and casts himself as a ruthless patriot, posed in combat gear with his men in a salt mine beneath Soledar and said they had captured it alone.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The capture of Soledar, despite its now-ruined state, would therefore be rare progress.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-1-11-23/h_13bb32f230056ee1552eeda2bb162e1f" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 11th, 2023</div></div>| Moscow has struggled for months to attack Bakhmut from the east, but were it to capture Soledar, Moscow would at least be able to approach the city from a different path. The Russian armed forces have had nothing to celebrate since the beginning of July, and have had to retreat in both Kharkiv to the north and Kherson in southern Ukraine. The capture of Soledar, despite its now-ruined state, would therefore be rare progress. But it would be symbolic rather than substantive.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Russian military commentators and Prigozhin have promoted this feat in anticipation that Wagner forces may soon capture the nearby city of Bakhmut.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/01/10/putin-wagner-convicts-secret-pardon/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 10th, 2023</div></div>| It was credited with critical strategic wins over the summer and openly praised by Russian state media, putting an end to the years-long open secret of the groups very existence. Most recently, Wagner forces claimed to capture territory near the town of Soledar in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine. Russian military commentators and Prigozhin have promoted this feat in anticipation that Wagner forces may soon capture the nearby city of Bakhmut. On Monday, Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of Ukraines ground forces, visited troops fighting to defend these two cities and said Wagners successes were exaggerated.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> The AP was unable independently to verify either side's claims.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/arkansas-democrat-gazette" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/jan/12/russias-top-general-placed-over-troops-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Jan 12th, 2023</div></div>| He claimed about 500 people were killed and that "the whole city is littered with the corpses of Ukrainian soldiers." Ukraine's military said late Wednesday Russian forces had suffered "huge losses" in the Soledar fighting. The AP was unable independently to verify either side's claims. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stopped short of declaring the municipality's capture, telling reporters Russian forces had achieved "positive dynamics in advancing" in Soledar.|
