# What are the possible consequences of the Russian military's focus shifting from Soledar to Bakhmut?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The capture of Soledar by Russian forces could facilitate the encirclement and disruption of Ukrainian supply lines to Bakhmut, potentially enabling a Russian advance toward key Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, taking Bakhmut is not guaranteed to lead to a wider collapse of Ukrainian defenses in the region, indicating that the strategic impact of seizing Soledar may be limited <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
The capture of Soledar by Russian forces, although not of significant military value on its own, is strategically important as it lies just north of Bakhmut, a key target for the Russians aiming to disrupt Ukrainian supply lines and advance towards other strongholds in Donetsk province <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. If Soledar falls, it would allow the Russians to position artillery and potentially encircle Bakhmut from the north, putting pressure on Ukrainian defenses and supply routes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Taking Bakhmut could serve as a gateway for Russian forces to move toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, indicating a deeper push into the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, despite these potential gains for Russia, the outcome of capturing Bakhmut is not a guaranteed collapse of Ukrainian defenses or a strategic withdrawal, as Ukrainian forces remain firmly in control of key areas in Donetsk <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The capture of Soledar by Russian forces, despite being of minimal military significance, has strategic implications as it could potentially disrupt Ukrainian supply lines and enable the Russians to partially encircle the city of Bakhmut from the north <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This shift in focus towards Bakhmut is crucial as taking the city would allow Russian forces to advance towards Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which are key Ukrainian strongholds in the Donetsk province <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Moreover, controlling Soledar could provide new locations for Moscow's forces to place artillery, increasing the pressure on Ukrainian defenses in Bakhmut <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>However, it is important to note that the fall of Soledar does not guarantee the collapse of Ukrainian defenses in the Donetsk region, nor does it ensure a strategic withdrawal by Ukrainian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The Institute for the Study of War emphasizes that control of Soledar will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Additionally, the heavy casualties resulting from the war of attrition may render a Russian victory as costly as a defeat, suggesting that the battle for Bakhmut, even if Soledar is taken, will be far from decisive <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Soledar's fall would make "holding Bakhmut much more precarious for Ukraine," Michael Kofman, the director of Russia Studies at the CAN nonprofit research group in Arlington, Va., noted.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/arkansas-democrat-gazette" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/jan/12/russias-top-general-placed-over-troops-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Jan 12th, 2023</div></div>| Soledar, known for salt mining and processing, has little intrinsic value but it lies at a strategic point six miles north of the city of Bakhmut, which Russian forces want to surround. Taking Bakhmut would disrupt Ukraine's supply lines and open a route for the Russians to press toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk province. Soledar's fall would make "holding Bakhmut much more precarious for Ukraine," Michael Kofman, the director of Russia Studies at the CAN nonprofit research group in Arlington, Va., noted. The war of attrition, with heavy casualties, may make a Russian victory as deadly as a defeat.|

The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal. However, its capture would allow Russian forces, and especiallythe Wagner mercenary group, to turn their focus on nearby Bakhmut, which has been a target since the summer.

|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> It could put pressure on Ukrainian supply lines that run toward the city.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/01/13/world/russia-ukraine-news" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Jan 13th, 2023</div></div>| The battle has put into sharp relief Russias costly and grinding offensive in eastern Ukraine as it attempts to take the nearby city of Bakhmut, part of its goal of controlling the entire Donbas region. Seizing Soledar is not expected to quickly change the battle in the east, but it would give Moscows forces new locations to place artillery and the potential to partially encircle Bakhmut from the north. It could put pressure on Ukrainian supply lines that run toward the city. Russias Defense Ministry said in a statement on Friday that its troops had "completed" their capture of the town overnight.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Taking Bakhmut would disrupt Ukraine's supply lines and open a route for Russian forces to press toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, key Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/arkansas-democrat-gazette" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/jan/11/ukrainians-to-receive-patriot-training-in-us/" target="_blank">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Jan 11th, 2023</div></div>| Russia's grinding eastern offensive captured almost all of Luhansk during the summer. Donetsk escaped the same fate, and the Russian military subsequently poured manpower and resources around Bakhmut. Taking Bakhmut would disrupt Ukraine's supply lines and open a route for Russian forces to press toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, key Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk. Like Mariupol and other contested cities, Bakhmut endured a long siege without water and power even before Moscow launched massive strikes to take out public utilities across Ukraine.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Even if Russia were to succeed with its efforts in Soledar, the predicted collapse of Ukrainian defences in the Donetsk region or a strategic withdrawal are by no means foregone conclusions.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/conversation-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-the-bloody-battle-for-soledar-and-what-it-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-conflict-197625" target="_blank">The Conversation</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Jan 12th, 2023</div></div>| Controlling Soledar will, if anything, only be a stepping stone towards the much bigger prize of nearby Bakhmut, one of the last big cities in Donetsk oblast that has not been captured by Russia. Yet, here Ukrainian forces remain firmly in control. Even if Russia were to succeed with its efforts in Soledar, the predicted collapse of Ukrainian defences in the Donetsk region or a strategic withdrawal are by no means foregone conclusions.

|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Capturing Soledar would allow Russian forces, and especially the Wagner mercenary group, to turn their focus on nearby Bakhmut, which has been a target since the summer.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-1-13-23/h_de54be1093f5a127defd5f35b6f1fa61" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 13th, 2023</div></div>| Serhiy Cherevaty, spokesman for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told Ukrainian outlet RBC-Ukraine that "fighting is going on in the city." Russia's defense ministry said Friday that its forces had taken the town, in what would represent a symbolic if not strategic victory for Moscow. Capturing Soledar would allow Russian forces, and especially the Wagner mercenary group, to turn their focus on nearby Bakhmut, which has been a target since the summer.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> It added that "establishing control over Soledar makes it possible to cut off the supply routes for Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-1-13-23/h_e9b47e51554e95c246cb8a37d7f8cb3a" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 13th, 2023</div></div>| In recent days there have been competing claims over who has control of the town amid fierce fighting. Russia said the capture of Soledar was"important for the continuation of successful offensive operations in the Donetsk region." It added that "establishing control over Soledar makes it possible to cut off the supply routes for Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut." The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Seizing the town would make it possible to cut off Ukrainian supply routes to the nearby city of Bakhmut and trap remaining Ukrainian forces there, it said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-fights-russian-assault-salt-mining-town-along-eastern-front-2023-01-09/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 9th, 2023</div></div>| But the capture of the town has taken on an outsized importance as it would, if confirmed, give Moscow a trophy for one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war following major battlefield setbacks throughout the second half of 2022. "The capture of Soledar was made possible by the constant bombardment of the enemy by assault and army aviation, missile forces and artillery of a grouping of Russian forces," Moscow's defence ministry said. Seizing the town would make it possible to cut off Ukrainian supply routes to the nearby city of Bakhmut and trap remaining Ukrainian forces there, it said. Moscow has been trying to seize Bakhmut for months.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> The capture of Soledar would serve a military purpose while not constituting a turning point in the war, analysts said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-claims-control-soledar-eastern-ukraine-putin-success-rcna65240" target="_blank">NBC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The town lies in the eastern Donetsk region, one of four that Putin claimed to have annexed last year despite failing to fully control. After the Russian retreat from Kherson in the south, the focus of the war moved east through the winter to waves of Russian attacks and artillery battles against Ukrainian positions. The capture of Soledar would serve a military purpose while not constituting a turning point in the war, analysts said. It could also fulfil a personal goal of bolstering Prigozhins growing reputation.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> The Institute for the Study of War said control of Soledar "will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut," the larger prize.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-1-11-23/h_13bb32f230056ee1552eeda2bb162e1f" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 11th, 2023</div></div>| The capture of Soledar, despite its now-ruined state, would therefore be rare progress. But it would be symbolic rather than substantive. The Institute for the Study of War said control of Soledar "will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut," the larger prize. But Soledar is of outsize significance to one man: oligarch and Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin.|
