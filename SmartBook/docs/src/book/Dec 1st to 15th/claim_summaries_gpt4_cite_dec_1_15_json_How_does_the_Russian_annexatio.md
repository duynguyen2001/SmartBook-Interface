The annexation of territory where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located by Russia has complicated international efforts to ensure the safety and security of the plant. Russian troops have occupied the plant since March, with Russia claiming the plant is on its territory and asserting that only they can ensure its safety, a claim that has been disputed by Ukraine and international bodies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. This has led to a tense situation with the plant in a precarious state, as shelling has continued around the site. Ukraine has called for the demilitarization of the area, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has proposed creating a demilitarized zone around the plant. However, the Russian Foreign Ministry has rejected these proposals, undermining diplomatic efforts and raising fears of a potential nuclear disaster <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The IAEA has been actively involved in trying to establish a safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, given that it is Europe's largest and the risks of radioactivity release are high. The agency, along with Western powers, has raised alarms over the safety of the plant's six nuclear reactors. However, negotiations aimed at demilitarizing the area have stalled as Russia maintains control and denies any possibility of withdrawing its troops or transferring control to a third party. The West continues to support Ukraine and calls for pressure on Russia to return to negotiations, emphasizing the importance of avoiding escalation around civilian nuclear power. Yet, the Russian position has impeded progress, leaving the situation unresolved and the risk of a nuclear incident a significant concern <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

Speaking to AFP on Monday, he said Russias war in Ukraine "completely changes our understanding of nuclear security", pointing to the capture of the Zaporizhzhia plant as a turning point. The nuclear plant, located in Ukraines east, was seized by Russian troops in March, and shelling has continued around the site. Despite Western powers and the UN atomic energy agency raising the alarm over safety at the plant which has six nuclear reactors talks aimed at demilitarising the area have stalled.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Citing Peskovs denials, he added that this is not a "likely" scenario, because Russian troop withdrawal from the plant would immediately lead to its takeover by Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsfate-of-znpp-continues-to-be-focus-of-rumour-10407567" target="_blank">neimagazine.com</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| In a long discussion in BFM.ru on 5 December, internationally recognised Russian commentator George Bovt, referring to Grossis latest interview, noted: "If you read Ukrainian sources, most of them predict the imminent withdrawal of Russian troops from the Zaporizhia NPP. Apparently, the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi is also leaning towards this most desirable version of the agreement, hoping to conclude it before the New Year In this case, the agency will advocate the creation of a certain demilitarised zone around the nuclear power plant, which, in the eyes of the IAEA, would be only a temporary solution, because the IAEA still considers Zaporizhia NPP to belong to Ukraine." Citing Peskovs denials, he added that this is not a "likely" scenario, because Russian troop withdrawal from the plant would immediately lead to its takeover by Ukraine. Bovt notes "a number of indirect signs also indicate that Moscow is not yet considering the option of completely abandoning the plant as part of the agreement under the auspices of the IAEA".|

But Russian Foreign Ministry spokespersonMaria Zakharova said that there can be "no talk of any withdrawal of ZNPP from Russia or transfer control over it to a third party." "The station is located on Russian territory and is fully controlled by Russia," said Zakharova on Monday. "We presume that only we are able to ensure the physical and nuclear safety of ZNPP."|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> The IAEA has already deployed teams to Zaporizhzhia, where Russian troops have seized control of the plant and claimed to have annexed the region into Russia.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/voice-america" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/latest-developments-in-ukraine-dec-13/6873855.html" target="_blank">Voice of America (VOA)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 13th, 2022</div></div>| The prime minister said the IAEAs teams would deploy to plants at Zaporizhzhia, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, Pivdennoukrainska and Chernobyl without specifying a time frame. Shmygal added that during the meeting with Grossi he had repeated a call for the "demilitarization" of the plant in Zaporizhzhia, describing it as a priority for Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The IAEA has already deployed teams to Zaporizhzhia, where Russian troops have seized control of the plant and claimed to have annexed the region into Russia. "The plant is still in a very precarious situation," Grossi said ahead of the meeting.|

A leak from Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is among the highest risk, experts told USA TODAY, because Russia has deliberately targeted the area. Zaporizhzhia is Europe's largest nuclear power station and has been under Russian control since shortly after the invasion. The U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency is trying to establish a safety zone around the plant because while nuclear power plants are built to withstand many natural disasters, few are designed to survive direct military attacks, said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists.|
