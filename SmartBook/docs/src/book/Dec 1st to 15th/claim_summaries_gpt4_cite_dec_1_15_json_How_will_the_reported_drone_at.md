<template v-slot:summary>
The reported drone attacks on Russian soil signify Ukraine's capability to escalate the conflict on its own terms, potentially affecting regional security dynamics by challenging Russia's military posture and demonstrating vulnerabilities in Russian air defenses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These incidents underscore the immediacy of the threat to Russia's strategic sites, which may prompt Moscow to reassess its battlefield strategies in Ukraine and could alter the perceptions of Western leaders regarding Russia's nuclear threats <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The strikes also have the potential to influence Russia's relations with neighboring countries, as they illustrate a shift in the conflict's nature to a more extensive patriotic struggle for Russia, which may lead to increased regional tensions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Moreover, the attacks provide a morale boost for Ukrainian civilians, sending a message of resilience that could resonate with neighboring states monitoring the conflict's progression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The recent drone strikes on Russian military airfields, hundreds of miles inside Russian territory, have posed a significant military challenge to the Kremlin and potentially altered the regional security dynamics. These attacks, which Russia attributes to Ukraine, have exposed vulnerabilities in Russian air defenses and could shift Moscow's strategy on the battlefield in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Moreover, the strikes have political implications, reinforcing President Putin's narrative that Russia is engaged in a patriotic struggle for survival, and thereby justifying extreme measures, including the potential use of Russia's vast nuclear arsenal as a deterrent or retaliation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This has implications for Russia's relations with neighboring countries, particularly Ukraine, as it demonstrates Kyiv's capability and willingness to escalate the conflict on its own terms, which could influence diplomatic and military decisions in the ongoing conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the attacks have broader implications for international law and human rights. The targeting of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine by Russian forces, which has rendered some cities barely habitable, constitutes a violation of International humanitarian law and is considered a war crime, exacerbating tensions and potentially impacting Russia's international relations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Western reactions to these developments, such as cautious comments from leaders like France's Macron, could affect the unity of Western allies against Russia, as they grapple with the implications of providing security guarantees to Moscow amidst these escalations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Simultaneously, Ukraine's refusal to concede any land and the continuous targeting of its energy infrastructure underline the heightened stakes and the potential for further deterioration in Russia's relations with its neighbors <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The regional security dynamics are further complicated by Russia's concerns regarding U.S. military capabilities and Putin's claims of Russia's advanced hypersonic weapons, which could also influence Russia's strategic calculations and its interactions with neighboring countries <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

## Claims

|---|---|---|
|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Aside from the symbolism of striking airfields linked to Russias nuclear deterrent, the attacks may have immediate effects on Moscows strategy on the battlefield in Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/06/ukraine-drones-russian-airfield-attacks/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 6th, 2022</div></div>| Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly alluded to his countrys vast nuclear arsenal, making veiled threats that he is prepared to resort to extreme measures to deter Western involvement in the war or as retaliation if Ukraine targets critical infrastructure inside Russia. The vulnerability of strategic sites to relatively simple drone technology may change the way Western leaders perceive these threats. Aside from the symbolism of striking airfields linked to Russias nuclear deterrent, the attacks may have immediate effects on Moscows strategy on the battlefield in Ukraine. "In the practical sense, this is a serious and imminent problem for the Russian Defense Ministry," Ruslan Leviev, an analyst with Conflict Intelligence Team, said in a daily video briefing.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> US officials believe Putin is belatedly realizing something that has been blindingly obvious those outside the cocoon of sycophancy in the Kremlin: Russia lacks the military means to accomplish its political ends in Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bloomberg-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-12-14/is-putin-finally-getting-smart-about-his-ukraine-disaster" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 14th, 2022</div></div>| Ukraine and Russia both face key decisions that could reshape the conflict diplomatically and militarily. Perhaps the most worrying possibility for Ukraine, and for the US, is that Russian President Vladimir Putin will finally start showing the strategic smarts he has demonstrated in the past. US officials believe Putin is belatedly realizing something that has been blindingly obvious those outside the cocoon of sycophancy in the Kremlin: Russia lacks the military means to accomplish its political ends in Ukraine.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> These attacks represent a serious military challenge for the Kremlin but are also politically convenient.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/times-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/putins-new-strategy-to-win-the-propaganda-war-over-ukraine-invasion-kk52d9j83" target="_blank">The Times</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Long-range Ukrainian drone strikes on air bases hundreds of miles inside Russian territory on Monday and Tuesday demonstrated that Kyiv was willing and able to escalate the war on its own terms. These attacks represent a serious military challenge for the Kremlin but are also politically convenient. They reinforce President Putins new message: that this is a national, patriotic struggle for the survival of the Motherland in which there can be no bystanders or backsliders.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> No footage or images of the remnants of drones have been published.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/europe/ukraine-drone-russia-air-base-attacks-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 5th, 2022</div></div>| The Russian Defense Ministry said that Ukraine used drones to attack two Russian military airfields on Monday morning, adding that its air defenses intercepted the attacks "in the Saratov and Ryazan regions," according to a statement carried on the official Russian news agency RIA Novosti. The two bases, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, are hundreds of miles inside Russian territory and beyond the reach of Ukraines declared arsenal of drones. No footage or images of the remnants of drones have been published. In the western Russian city of Engels, around 500 miles (more than 800 kilometers) southeast of Moscow, CCTV footage appeared to show an explosion lighting up the sky at around 6 a.m. local time on Monday morning.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Analysts were cautious about the military impact of the apparent attacks on strategic sites far from the front lines, but said they had further undermined Russian confidence in the country's air defenses while providing a timely morale boost for Ukrainian civilians preparing for a long winter under bombardment.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukrainian-drone-attacks-russia-airbases-kursk-putin-war-what-it-means-rcna60276" target="_blank">NBC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility, but officials have jokingly suggested its military may be behind the incidents. Russias defense ministry blamed Kyivs forces for the two blasts Monday, in which it said three "maintenance personnel" died and two planes were damaged. Analysts were cautious about the military impact of the apparent attacks on strategic sites far from the front lines, but said they had further undermined Russian confidence in the country's air defenses while providing a timely morale boost for Ukrainian civilians preparing for a long winter under bombardment. "The signaling is important for the Ukrainians: They need to know that they are hitting back, given the amount of pain and devastation and general discomfort thats being meted out in Ukraine," Matthew Ford, an associate professor at the Swedish Defense University in Stockholm, told NBC News.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Kyiv has not yet commented on this latest possible attack.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 6th, 2022</div></div>| Russia blamed Kyiv for the attacks but Ukraine has not publicly commented on the incidents. On Tuesday morning, the governor of Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, said there was a "drone attack" near an airfield in the region. Kyiv has not yet commented on this latest possible attack. The claimed Kursk attack followed other, similar blasts at Russian bases, some of which have been located hundreds of miles within Russia, well beyond the range of any prior Ukrainian attacks.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Both the targeted and indiscriminate attacks carried out by the Russian military against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine are violations of International humanitarian law (IHL) and, per the findings of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, actions by Russian forces amount to war crimes.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://pen.org/report/ukrainian-culture-under-attack/" target="_blank">pen.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 2nd, 2022</div></div>| The damage and destruction cannot be seen as simply incidental, collateral damage resulting from Russian military operations targeting Ukrainian military targets. Rather, the magnitude of the destruction suggests a deliberate campaign to destroy civilian infrastructure, rendering some cities barely habitable, and an attempt to destroy civilian morale. Both the targeted and indiscriminate attacks carried out by the Russian military against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine are violations of International humanitarian law (IHL) and, per the findings of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, actions by Russian forces amount to war crimes. The conduct of Russias military and occupation forces also violates international human rights law, including Ukrainians right to culture.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> In addition, such comments are likely to jeopardise the unity between western allies against Russia, as many western countries do not want to give any concessions or security guarantees to the Russian regime."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1705741/ukraine-live-russia-latest-angels-save-pows" target="_blank">express.co.uk</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 7th, 2022</div></div>| Whilst we can assume that Macrons recent comments are probably caused by his fear that not providing any security guarantees to Russia may lead to escalations in the future, making such comments is not prudent. "For one, such comments are likely to provide Putin and his supporters more leverage in making further demands. In addition, such comments are likely to jeopardise the unity between western allies against Russia, as many western countries do not want to give any concessions or security guarantees to the Russian regime."|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Moscow is also targeting Ukraines energy infrastructure with waves of missile and drone strikes, at times cutting off electricity for millions of civilians in winter, when mean temperatures can be several degrees below zero Celsius.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.fbcnews.com.fj/world/zelenskiys-talks-with-other-leaders-signal-diplomatic-flurry-around-ukraine/" target="_blank">fbcnews.com.fj</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The government in Kyiv has ruled out conceding any land to Russia in return for peace. On the ground in Ukraine, the entire eastern front line has been continuously shelled with heavy fighting taking place. Moscow is also targeting Ukraines energy infrastructure with waves of missile and drone strikes, at times cutting off electricity for millions of civilians in winter, when mean temperatures can be several degrees below zero Celsius.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> He claimed that Russia already has commissioned hypersonic weapons capable of carrying out such a strike, while the U.S. hasn't yet deployed them.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/09/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 9th, 2022</div></div>| For years, the Kremlin has expressed concern about U.S. efforts to develop the so-called Conventional Prompt Global Strike capability that envisions hitting an adversary's strategic targets with precision-guided conventional weapons anywhere in the world within one hour. "Speaking about a disarming strike, maybe it's worth thinking about adopting the ideas developed by our U.S. counterparts, their ideas of ensuring their security," Putin said with a thin smile, noting that such a preemptive strike was intended to knock out command facilities. He claimed that Russia already has commissioned hypersonic weapons capable of carrying out such a strike, while the U.S. hasn't yet deployed them. He also claimed that Russia now has cruise missiles that surpass their U.S. equivalents.|
