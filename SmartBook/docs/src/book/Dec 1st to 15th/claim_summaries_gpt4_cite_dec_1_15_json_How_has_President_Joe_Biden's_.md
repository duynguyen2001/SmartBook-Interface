President Joe Biden has maintained that he is open to dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but only under the condition that Putin seeks a genuine end to the war in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

While initially stating he has no immediate plans to contact Putin, Biden has indicated his preparedness to speak with the Russian leader if there is an indication that Putin is looking for a way to end the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has suggested that Biden's precondition for talks, which includes Putin withdrawing from Ukraine, coupled with the U.S.'s non-recognition of annexed Ukrainian territories, makes such negotiations unlikely <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
During the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, President Joe Biden has maintained a position of cautious openness towards dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with specific preconditions. Initially, Biden had not spoken to Putin since the conflict began nearly ten months ago, indicating a lack of direct engagement <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. However, his stance has evolved to express a willingness to speak with Putin if the Russian leader demonstrates a genuine interest in finding a way to end the war. Biden's conditional readiness for discussions is contingent upon Putin's readiness to seek an end to the conflict and would also involve consultation with NATO allies, particularly following the alignment expressed with French President Emmanuel Macron on supporting Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>Biden's approach is marked by a clear demand that Putin must be looking for a way to "pull out" of Ukraine, which reflects the U.S. position that Russia must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and pre-war bordersâ€”a stance that contrasts with the Kremlin's expectation that the U.S. recognize the annexed Ukrainian regions as part of Russia, which the U.S. does not <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Despite the Kremlin's openness to negotiations under conditions that safeguard Russia's "national interests," Biden's insistence on these territories being a sticking point makes the likelihood of talks complex <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Thus, Biden's readiness to engage in dialogue with Putin is not without significant reservations and conditions, reflecting a nuanced and strategic approach to the possibility of negotiations within the broader framework of the conflict and international relations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.
