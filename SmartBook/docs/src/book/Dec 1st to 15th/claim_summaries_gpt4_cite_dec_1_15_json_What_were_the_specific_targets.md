Ukrainian forces targeted various locations in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, demonstrating the strategic use of longer-range weapons in their efforts to reclaim territory in the south of the country. The specific targets hit included a barracks that housed Russian troops, a bridge critical for regional logistics, and a church that had been seized and converted into a Russian military base <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
