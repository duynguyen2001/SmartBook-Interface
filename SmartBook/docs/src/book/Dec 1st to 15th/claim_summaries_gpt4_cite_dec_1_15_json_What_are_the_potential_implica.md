<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The United States' non-recognition of the annexed Ukrainian regions complicates diplomatic talks with Russia, as highlighted by the Kremlin, because it undermines the possibility of finding mutual grounds for discussion <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This stance contributes to the impasse in peace negotiations and the continuation of conflict, as both the US and Ukraine remain firm on not conceding any territory despite Russia's declaration of annexation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The United States' non-recognition of the Ukrainian regions annexed by Russia hinders the possibility of diplomatic talks between Presidents Biden and Putin, as highlighted by Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who points out the difficulty in finding mutual grounds for discussion <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This stance by the U.S. complicates the search for a resolution, given that Moscow insists on the permanent inclusion of these regions within Russian territory, while the U.S. demands a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine as a precondition for negotiations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The ongoing conflict, with no peace talks in sight and continued hostilities, particularly in places like Bakhmut, underscores the deadlock, exacerbated by the entrenched positions of both Kyiv and Moscow, with the former refusing to concede any territory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The impasse over the annexed regions, therefore, presents significant policy implications for the United States, as it may need to consider strategies to increase the costs for Russia to sustain the conflict, as suggested by international relations theory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The United States' non-recognition of the Ukrainian regions annexed by Russia complicates potential diplomatic talks aimed at resolving the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov highlighted that the stance taken by Washington hinders the possibility of finding common ground for discussions between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Peskov pointed out that Biden's precondition for talks, which is the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, coupled with the US's non-acceptance of the annexation, makes the initiation of negotiations unlikely <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>This diplomatic impasse is further entrenched as President Biden insists that the only rational way to end the war is for Russia to "pull out" of Ukraine, with no immediate plans for contact between the two leaders unless Putin expresses an interest in ending the conflict, something he has yet to do <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Additionally, Biden's support for Ukraine's sovereignty and his stipulation that any negotiations must respect Ukraine's conditions and territorial integrity emphasizes the US's firm position against recognizing the annexation, aligning with international condemnation of Russia's actions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The US's stance reflects a broader strategy to increase the costs to Russia for its involvement in the conflict, as advised by international relations theorists like John Mearsheimer, and is likely to continue as part of the US policy response to the crisis <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The fact that Washington doesn't recognizeannexed Ukrainian regions as part of Russia would complicate possible talks betweenUS President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-12-02-22/h_0d8bad7427b5e0e17a20d642d25862d8" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 2nd, 2022</div></div>| The fact that Washington doesn't recognizeannexed Ukrainian regions as part of Russia would complicate possible talks betweenUS President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday. In September, Moscow illegally declared four Ukrainian regions to be Russian territory: Luhansk and Donetsk -- home to two Russian-backed breakaway republics where fighting has been ongoing since 2014 -- as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, two areas in southern Ukraine that had been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> "That complicates the search for grounds on which to hold mutual discussion."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/first-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/02/1140278989/putin-turns-down-biden-talks-ukraine-war" target="_blank">Up First</a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Dec 2nd, 2022</div></div>| But Peskov noted Biden's demand that Putin "pull out of Ukraine" made talks unlikely. "The U.S. still doesn't recognize new territories of the Russian Federation," Peskov said, in a reference to four regions of Ukraine the Kremlin illegally annexed to international condemnation in September. "That complicates the search for grounds on which to hold mutual discussion." The rejection of talks with Washington came as Putin provided a forceful defense of his actions in Ukraine in a phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> The government in Kyiv has ruled out conceding any land to Russia in return for peace.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/12/12/zelenskyy-renews-diplomacy-thanks-bidens-unprecedented-help" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 12th, 2022</div></div>| There are no ongoing peace talks and no end in sight to the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two. Moscow shows no signs of being ready to respect Ukraines sovereignty and pre-war borders, saying the four regions it claims to have annexed from Ukraine in September are part of Russia "forever". The government in Kyiv has ruled out conceding any land to Russia in return for peace. On the ground in Ukraine, soldiers are dug in along the front line in the east amid continued shelling and Zelenskyy said over the weekend that Russian attacks had left the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut in ruins.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> It complicated the search for a mutual basis for talks, he said, that the US did not recognise "new territories" in Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63832151" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| But Moscow was certainly not ready to accept US conditions: "What did President Biden say in fact? He said that negotiations are possible only after Putin leaves Ukraine." It complicated the search for a mutual basis for talks, he said, that the US did not recognise "new territories" in Ukraine. At the end of September, President Putin declared four Ukrainian regions as part of Russia, but while Russian forces in eastern Ukraine occupy most of Luhansk, their invasion of Donetsk has stalled and they are on the back foot in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Thus, the return of great-power hubris is evident, and it has significant policy implications for the United States.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2022/12/12/the-return-of-great-power-hubris/" target="_blank">georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 12th, 2022</div></div>| Meanwhile, domestic developments like Beijings failure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, its aggressive Zero-COVID policy, and human rights concerns over its exploitation of Uighurs have degraded international perceptions of China, which can hurt its future foreign policy and military gambits. Lastly, Xis aggressive marginalization of political opposition will likely eliminate checks on his authority, leaving China more vulnerable to the potentially disastrous consequences of his hubris. Thus, the return of great-power hubris is evident, and it has significant policy implications for the United States. US policymakers need to relearn the art of "bloodletting"a term coined by international relations theorist John Mearsheimer to describe a strategy "by which a country increases the costs to its rival by making a conflict in which that rival is involved more difficult."|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> He continued, "If that's the case, inconsultation with my French andmy NATO friends, I'll be happyto sit down with Putin to seewhat he wants, has in mind.He hasn't done that yet.In the meantime, I think it'sabsolutely critical whatEmmanuel [Macron] said.We must support the Ukrainianpeople."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-12-01-22/h_1afcfca3d8508076ab0eada482ed1206" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 1st, 2022</div></div>| US President Joe Biden described Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine as "sick" and said that there's only one rational way to end the war in Ukraine for Putin to "pull out" of the country. Biden added that he had no immediate plans to contact Putin, but is "prepared to speak" with the Russian leader "if in fact there is aninterest in him deciding he'slooking for a way to end thewar he hasn't done that yet." He continued, "If that's the case, inconsultation with my French andmy NATO friends, I'll be happyto sit down with Putin to seewhat he wants, has in mind.He hasn't done that yet.In the meantime, I think it'sabsolutely critical whatEmmanuel [Macron] said.We must support the Ukrainianpeople."|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> "I think there have been some concerns about the degree to which this dispute could impact the broader relationship, and potentially even cooperation on things like the response to the war in Ukraine," he said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/vox-conversations-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Mixed" /></a><div><a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/12/3/23489915/biden-putin-macron-diplomacy-france-russia-ukraine" target="_blank">Vox Conversations </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Dec 3rd, 2022</div></div>| Furthermore, he added, "If we want a sustainable peace, we have to respect the Ukrainians to decide the moment and the conditions in which they will negotiate about their territory and their future." The show of solidarity with Ukraine was important, according to Nicholas Lokker, a research assistant with the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, given that the US and France are working through disagreements about the clean energy provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. "I think there have been some concerns about the degree to which this dispute could impact the broader relationship, and potentially even cooperation on things like the response to the war in Ukraine," he said. "This is a real issue, but at the same time, its not directly related to the response to the war and I think theres a recognition that you can have individual disputes on particular policies that do not need to compromise the entire relationship."|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> But he also said that Russia had become bigger by annexing Ukrainian territory.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/07/world/russia-ukraine-war-news" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Dec 7th, 2022</div></div>| That has prompted fears that the Kremlin might announce another wave at any moment. On Wednesday, Mr. Putin appeared to acknowledge that the war, which began in February, is taking much longer that the Kremlin had expected. But he also said that Russia had become bigger by annexing Ukrainian territory. "This is a significant result," Mr. Putin said, referring to his move in September to declare four Ukrainian provinces part of Russia, a move that has been condemned as illegal by Ukraine and its international allies.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> The U.S. has said very clearly that that is a decision for Ukraine to take under the conditions that Ukraine has put forward, including around territorial integrity, including further guarantees that Russia would not pursue a fraught fall on engagement invasion.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bloomberg-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2022-12-01/s-p-s-newman-says-biden-looks-to-keep-unity-with-europe-video" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 1st, 2022</div></div>| President Biden is certainly looking to maintain that unity. There has been in recent weeks conversations or increasing noise around diplomatic diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. The U.S. has said very clearly that that is a decision for Ukraine to take under the conditions that Ukraine has put forward, including around territorial integrity, including further guarantees that Russia would not pursue a fraught fall on engagement invasion. And we've heard, of course, that President Macron is at for his side that perhaps in closed door session that he's more open to diplomatic route.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> The African Union has condemned Russias aggression, but many nations on the continent have otherwise tried to remain neutral because they have long-standing ties with Russia as well as the United States and depend on aid from both, though the United States makes far greater investments.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/12/biden-africa-ukraine-coalition/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 12th, 2022</div></div>| ArrowRight Biden this week will host the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, an event last held eight years ago under President Barack Obama. This time, the event comes as the White House is working, with mixed success so far, to coax support from African nations that have been hit especially hard by the consequences of the war in Ukraine, especially a wheat shortage and a disruption in the food supply but also rising fertilizer and fuel prices. The African Union has condemned Russias aggression, but many nations on the continent have otherwise tried to remain neutral because they have long-standing ties with Russia as well as the United States and depend on aid from both, though the United States makes far greater investments. That has played out starkly at the United Nations, where many African countries have declined to vote in favor of U.S.-backed initiatives on Ukraine despite lobbying by the Biden administration.|
