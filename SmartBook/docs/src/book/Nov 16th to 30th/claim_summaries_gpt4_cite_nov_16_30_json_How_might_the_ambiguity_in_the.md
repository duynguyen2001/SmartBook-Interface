The ambiguity in the joint statement after the G7 meeting may lead the international community to perceive a cautious approach to assigning blame for the missile strike in Poland, as initial US assessments suggest the missile, while Russian-made, may have originated from Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite this, the statement emphasizes the broader issue of "barbaric missile attacks" by Russia on Ukraine, without directly linking these to the incident in Poland <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This suggests a focus on condemning Russia's ongoing aggression while avoiding premature conclusions about the specific explosion in Poland, as President Joe Biden indicated it was "unlikely" the missile came from Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The deliberate vagueness allows for further investigation and reflects the complexity of the situation where different assessments and views are acknowledged <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

The ambiguity in the joint statement after the G7 meeting regarding the missile that struck Poland has left room for varying interpretations among the international community concerning accountability for the strike. While the statement condemned the "barbaric missile attacks" by Russia on Ukrainian cities, it refrained from directly linking these attacks to the explosion in Poland, focusing instead on the need for investigation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This deliberate ambiguity may be interpreted as a cautious approach to assigning blame, especially in light of President Biden's comments suggesting it was "unlikely" the missile originated from Russia, and preliminary assessments indicating it may have been a Ukrainian defense missile meant to intercept a Russian attack <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The international community's perception of the incident's accountability is further complicated by the G20's earlier declaration, which mirrored the G7's cautious language and acknowledged differing views on the situation and sanctions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This diplomatic hedging is seen as a means to avoid an immediate escalation, particularly given the broader geopolitical context and the need to maintain a united front in support of Ukraine without exacerbating tensions with Russia. With the G7 and G20's measured response, the international community is left to grapple with the implications of a NATO member being struck during the conflict and the potential that this was an unintended consequence of Ukraine's defense measures, rather than a direct Russian provocation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

The incident marked the first time a NATO-member has been directly hit during the conflict. It is not known who fired the missile, or exactly where it was launched from. CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed reporting.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> The circumstances surrounding the incident, which marked the first time a NATO country had been directly hit during the almost nine-month conflict, remain unclear.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/biden-egypt-cambodia-indonesia-trip-takeaways/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 16th, 2022</div></div>| Biden administration officials had billed the G20 summit as another effort to rally world leaders in support of Ukraine amid Russias ongoing aggression, but the issue reached a new level of urgency when leaders in Indonesia were awoken early Wednesday to reports that a missile had landed in Poland Ukraines neighbor to the west and a NATO ally and killed two people. NATO and G7 allied leaders at the summit, led by Biden, held and emergency meeting in Bali to discuss their approach to the explosion. The circumstances surrounding the incident, which marked the first time a NATO country had been directly hit during the almost nine-month conflict, remain unclear. Biden said after the meeting that preliminary information suggested it was "unlikely" the missile was fired from within Russia, but was unable to say conclusively until the investigation was complete.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> The joint statement after the G7 meeting was also deliberately ambiguous when it came to the incident, putting far more focus on the dozens of strikes that happened in the hours before the missives crossed into Poland.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-11-16-22/h_65b402faeac4e77eab7098d14b0ee2ee" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 16th, 2022</div></div>| Two officials briefed on initial US assessments said it appears the missile that killed two people in eastern Poland Wednesday originated in Ukraine, even though it was Russian made. The official said that assessment is what President Joe Biden appeared to be alluding to in his remarks earlier when he said it was "unlikely" the missile originated in Russia, The officials said intelligence assessments had been discussed at the emergency meeting called by Biden on the margins of the G20 summit in Bali and would also be a topic of conversation at a meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels. The joint statement after the G7 meeting was also deliberately ambiguous when it came to the incident, putting far more focus on the dozens of strikes that happened in the hours before the missives crossed into Poland. A spokesperson with the US National Security Council declined to comment on reports that the Russian-made missile that landed in eastern Poland killing two people was fired by Ukrainian forces trying to intercept a Russian attack.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> The joint statement also condemns "barbaric missile attacks that Russia perpetrated on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure on Tuesday," but does not suggest any link to the explosion in Poland.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/2135/" target="_blank">www3.nhk.or.jp</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The leaders of the G7 countries, the European Union, Spain and the Netherlands have offered help for investigators looking into a deadly blast in a village near Poland's border with Ukraine. Early reports suggest it was caused by a Russian-made missile, though Polish officials say they don't yet know the culprit, and US President Joe Biden says it's unlikely it came from Russia. The joint statement also condemns "barbaric missile attacks that Russia perpetrated on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure on Tuesday," but does not suggest any link to the explosion in Poland.

|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> So much so, in fact, that countries submitting to multilateral constraint when using strikes tactically can be absolved by the public of any moral culpability for civilian casualties.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://tnsr.org/2022/11/the-moral-legitimacy-of-drone-strikes-how-the-public-forms-its-judgments/" target="_blank">tnsr.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 17th, 2022</div></div>| In order to investigate this proposition, I conducted an original survey experiment. The results indicate that the publics perception of what constitutes a morally legitimate drone strike is not reducible to either use or to constraint alone, as is often suggested by scholars working in the classical just war tradition that is based on jus ad bellum (justice of war) and jus in bello (justice in war).21 The results also suggest that at least the appearance of higher external control over a countrys strikes does increase their perceived legitimacy. So much so, in fact, that countries submitting to multilateral constraint when using strikes tactically can be absolved by the public of any moral culpability for civilian casualties. In addition, the publics perception of the moral legitimacy of drone strikes appears not to be a function of soldiers battlefield courage, soldiers safety, or the protection of civilians alone.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> That assessment and Bidens comments at the G20 summit in Bali contradict information earlier Tuesday that Russian missiles crossed into Poland.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/16/ukraine-allies-say-kyiv-behind-strike-on-poland-but-blame-russia" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 16th, 2022</div></div>| Russia denied any involvement in the Poland blast and summoned the Polish charg daffaires. Preliminary assessments suggest the missile was launched by Kyivs forces at an incoming Russian one in the crushing salvo against Ukraines electrical infrastructure Tuesday. That assessment and Bidens comments at the G20 summit in Bali contradict information earlier Tuesday that Russian missiles crossed into Poland. Soon after the blast, a statement from the Polish foreign ministry identified the weapon as being made in Russia.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> There was no condemnation of Russia in that statement.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/podcasts/2022/11/23/when-the-russia-ukraine-war-spills-over-to-its-neighbours" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 23rd, 2022</div></div>| But that actually was postponed by an hour, and some of the world leaders decided to have a meeting, which was interesting. A meeting chaired by President Biden, and at the end of that meeting, they issued a statement condemning the missile attacks, which had also taken place on Ukraine, and saying there needed to be an investigation into what had happened in Poland. There was no condemnation of Russia in that statement. And the reason why, I think emerged just a few minutes later, when President Biden was speaking to reporters.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> However, the statement did not address the circumstances of the strike, including whether it could have been a targeting error or if the missile could have been knocked off course by Ukrainian defenses.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-missiles-crossed-into-poland-killing-two-u-s-official/" target="_blank">CBS News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| After the missile fell, Polish Foreign Affairs Minister Zbigniew Rau "demanded immediate and detailed explanation" from Russia, according to a statement by the Polish foreign ministry. Poland also noted that the incident took place as "another hours-long, massive shelling took place of the entire territory of Ukraine and its critical infrastructure by the armed forces of the Russian Federation." However, the statement did not address the circumstances of the strike, including whether it could have been a targeting error or if the missile could have been knocked off course by Ukrainian defenses. A NATO statement called it a "tragic incident."|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> G20 leaders left Bali relieved that the missile that landed in Poland, killing two people, was most likely a Ukrainian air defence missile, rather than a deliberate Russian provocation, but the episode underlined the vulnerability of the Eastern borders of Nato.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/16/emmanuel-macron-visit-xi-jinping-ukraine-china-mediating-role" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 16th, 2022</div></div>| Sceptics say that Putin and Xi committed themselves to a partnership without limits very soon before the invasion, and China has done little to distance itself from Russia subsequently. But Chinese sources told the FT they felt they were lied to by Putin, remarks that implied a weakening in the relationship. G20 leaders left Bali relieved that the missile that landed in Poland, killing two people, was most likely a Ukrainian air defence missile, rather than a deliberate Russian provocation, but the episode underlined the vulnerability of the Eastern borders of Nato. "It is an instructive lesson in how fragile this state of affairs remains", said one European diplomat.|
