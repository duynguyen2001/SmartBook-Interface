The trajectory analysis of the missile that exploded in Poland played a crucial role in President Biden's preliminary assessment of the incident. He indicated that based on the missile's trajectory, it was "unlikely" to have been fired from Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This stance was reiterated when he mentioned that there was preliminary information that contests the claims of the missile being fired from Russia and emphasized the importance of a complete investigation before making a definitive statement <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The trajectory analysis contributed to a cautious approach in attributing responsibility for the explosion, as President Biden sought to avoid escalating tensions without conclusive evidence <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The trajectory of the missile that caused an explosion in Poland was a crucial factor in President Joe Biden's preliminary assessment of its origin. Upon consulting with allies at the G20 Summit in Indonesia, Biden indicated that the initial trajectory analysis suggested it was "unlikely" that the missile was fired from Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This assessment was based on the path the missile would have taken, which did not align with a launch from within Russian territory according to the early data <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The president emphasized the importance of a full investigation before making a definitive statement, underscoring that while the trajectory pointed away from a Russian origin, conclusive evidence was still necessary <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the explosion, the analysis of the missile's trajectory informed discussions among NATO and G7 leaders during an emergency meeting led by Biden in Bali. The trajectory was a key piece of evidence that led to the consideration of alternative explanations, including the possibility that the missile was accidentally launched by Ukrainian air defenses during an attempt to intercept a Russian missile <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Moreover, Biden's reliance on the trajectory analysis was mirrored in statements by NATO officials and other U.S. officials who also mentioned preliminary assessments that pointed to Ukrainian forces as the potential source of the missile <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The consistent reference to the trajectory by Biden and other leaders indicates its significant role in shaping the international response and the direction of the ongoing investigation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

Rather than merely asserting that U.S. drone strikes are "righteous" or legitimate because they kill terrorists,129 as was the case following the strike in Afghanistan in August 2021, political and military officials now make an effort to explain in great detail what unilateral constraints they adopted to prevent civilian casualties. Bidens statement to the American people following the death of al Zawahiri is one recent example of the U.S. militarys heightened sensitivity to civilian casualties as a result of policy guidance from elected officials. President Joe Biden explained that the "mission was carefully planned and rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians.|

Biden said after the meeting that preliminary information suggested it was "unlikely" the missile was fired from within Russia, but was unable to say conclusively until the investigation was complete.

But three US officials said preliminary assessments suggest the missile was fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian projectile, and Biden said it was "unlikely" that it was fired from Russia. NATO chief spokeswoman Oana Lungescu described the blast as a "tragic incident".|
