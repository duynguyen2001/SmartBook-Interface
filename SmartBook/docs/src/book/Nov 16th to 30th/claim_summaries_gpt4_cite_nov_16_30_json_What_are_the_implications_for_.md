# What are the implications for international law and the rules of engagement if a missile from a non-aggressor country inadvertently strikes another sovereign nation?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
An inadvertent missile strike on a sovereign nation could trigger deliberations on collective self-defense measures under international agreements such as NATO's Article 5, potentially leading to a reevaluation of the incident's impact on mutual defense obligations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Moreover, such an event may raise concerns about the erosion of the targeted country's sovereignty and the rules of engagement, necessitating a balance between strategic military operations and respect for national boundaries to prevent an "imperial slide" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

The inadvertent strike of a missile from a non-aggressor country onto another sovereign nation raises significant questions regarding international law and rules of engagement, specifically the right to self-defense and collective defense as recognized by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter and NATO's Article 5 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Such an incident could prompt discussions among member countries to determine if the mutual defense clause should be invoked, as an armed attack on one member is deemed an attack on all, although this is not automatic and requires careful assessment <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The consequences of this could lead to a heightened state of military readiness and an emergency response from the impacted nation's government and military <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Moreover, the situation could test the boundaries of sovereignty and the norms that govern state interactions, as well as the potential for an "imperial slide" in cases where intervention by a country is perceived to exceed the scope of defense and slip into imperialistic use <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

The inadvertent strike of a missile from a non-aggressor country onto another sovereign nation poses significant challenges to international law and the rules of engagement, particularly in the context of NATO's collective defense mechanisms <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Should such an incident be perceived as an "armed attack" under NATO's Article 5, it could potentially trigger a collective defense response despite not being a deliberate act of aggression, which raises questions about the appropriate threshold for invoking mutual defense clauses and the risks of escalation in high-tension situations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. This underscores the importance of thorough investigation and cautious response to avoid misinterpretation and unintentional conflict expansion, especially considering the nuclear capabilities of involved states and the catastrophic consequences of miscalculated retaliatory actions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Moreover, the potential for an "imperial slide" exists when intervening powers may overstep sovereignty norms under the guise of protective measures, which could erode the targeted country's sovereignty and contribute to geopolitical instability <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The G20's recent joint statement, while not a forum for resolving security issues, acknowledges the significant economic repercussions that security matters can have on the global stage, suggesting a need for a nuanced approach to incidents of inadvertent strikes that balances the principles of national sovereignty, self-defense, and international cooperation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The emphasis on cooperative approaches and the strategic use of technology such as drones in augmenting security highlights the evolving nature of modern warfare and the corresponding need for updated frameworks in international law and engagement rules <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

This partly explains the heightened tensions around the island. It also means the ban could have serious geopolitical implications, potentially prohibiting Taiwan from selling semiconductor manufacturing equipment and advanced chips to Chinese companies. That said, China already produces about 15% of semiconductors globally, and its only a matter of time before it figures out how to produce more chips on its own, even at the higher end of the technological scale.|

In contrast to the tactical use of strikes, strategic strikes are characterized by the centralization of the authority to conduct strikes in executive officials, such as presidents or senior defense officials; the lack of reciprocal risk between combatants on either side of a conflict; a network of globally distributed bases from which to launch, recover, and maintain drones; and the potential erosion of a targeted countrys sovereignty, should an intervening country abuse the scope of its intervention.63 According to Brunstetter and Amlie Frey, this latter feature relates to an "imperial slide," which "occurs when protecting or restoring sovereignty slips into imperial drone use, thus marking the decision to override traditional sovereignty norms of other states.

Olivier Matthys / AP It also states that parties "agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area." Article 5 is not automatically invoked. Member countries must come together to evaluate a situation and determine whether it should be triggered.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> But the results of the investigation so far seemed to tamp down concerns that the explosion could escalate the conflict beyond Ukraines borders.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/16/world/russia-ukraine-war-news-g20" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Nov 16th, 2022</div></div>| "Ukraine had and has every right to defend itself." Initial reports had suggested the explosion might have been caused by a Russian missile, which prompted intense discussions and even some panic over whether Russia had somehow attacked a NATO ally, possible grounds to invoke the alliances mutual defense clause, defined in Article 5 of NATOs treaty. But the results of the investigation so far seemed to tamp down concerns that the explosion could escalate the conflict beyond Ukraines borders. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was skeptical of the preliminary conclusion, saying he had "no doubt that it was not our missile."|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> If the strike was found to be deliberate, it would mean that Russia had attacked a Nato member, which could then decide to invoke Article Five of the alliances treaty, according to which an attack against one member is considered to be an attack against them all.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/ukraine/2022/11/volodymyr-zelensky-losing-support-the-west-ukraine" target="_blank">newstatesman.com</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 23rd, 2022</div></div>| Polands government ministers rushed into an emergency meeting of the national security council in Warsaw. Polish military units were ordered to a heightened state of combat readiness. If the strike was found to be deliberate, it would mean that Russia had attacked a Nato member, which could then decide to invoke Article Five of the alliances treaty, according to which an attack against one member is considered to be an attack against them all. On the other side of the world, the US president, Joe Biden, who was attending the G20 summit in Bali, was woken by his aides.|

Since we have no indication of this was a deliberate attack or that Russia is planning any offensive military actions against NATO Allies.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> The circumstances surrounding the incident, which marked the first time a NATO country had been directly hit during the almost nine-month conflict, remain unclear.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/biden-egypt-cambodia-indonesia-trip-takeaways/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 16th, 2022</div></div>| Biden administration officials had billed the G20 summit as another effort to rally world leaders in support of Ukraine amid Russias ongoing aggression, but the issue reached a new level of urgency when leaders in Indonesia were awoken early Wednesday to reports that a missile had landed in Poland Ukraines neighbor to the west and a NATO ally and killed two people. NATO and G7 allied leaders at the summit, led by Biden, held and emergency meeting in Bali to discuss their approach to the explosion. The circumstances surrounding the incident, which marked the first time a NATO country had been directly hit during the almost nine-month conflict, remain unclear. Biden said after the meeting that preliminary information suggested it was "unlikely" the missile was fired from within Russia, but was unable to say conclusively until the investigation was complete.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> And in the nuclear age, the time constraints on decision-making are much greater, while the consequences of a mistake could be unimaginably high.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/jknox/missile-hits-poland-what-happens-next/" target="_blank">blog.ucsusa.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 18th, 2022</div></div>| It isnt difficult to imagine, in those circumstances, how easy it would be to speak or act hastily, to make the wrong decision with limited information. Thats what makes the fog of war so dangerous. And in the nuclear age, the time constraints on decision-making are much greater, while the consequences of a mistake could be unimaginably high. Because the United States and Russia keep hundreds of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert, leaders might believe they have only minutes to decide how to respond to a possible nuclear strike.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> If Russia had deliberately targeted Poland, it would risk drawing the 30-nation NATO alliance into the conflict.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-missiles-crossed-into-poland-killing-two-u-s-official/" target="_blank">CBS News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The Russian Defense Ministry denied responsibility for the incident, insisting that "no strikes were made against targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border by Russian means of destruction." In their statements, Poland and NATO used language that suggested they were not treating the explosion as a Russian attack, at least for now. If Russia had deliberately targeted Poland, it would risk drawing the 30-nation NATO alliance into the conflict. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called an emergency meeting for Wednesday of the alliance's envoys to discuss the event, and Ukraine's Ambassador to the United Nations Sergiy Kyslytsya told CBS News that he expected the incident to be discussed at a previously scheduled U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Wednesday, too.|

The Wednesday statement, which comes after days of closed-door negotiations between diplomats at this weeks summit in Bali, Indonesia, noted that the condemnation was endorsed by "most members" but said there "were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions." "Recognizing that the G20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, we acknowledge that security issues can have significant consequences for the global economy," the statement added. "Todays era must not be of war."|
