## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The collapse of the Black Sea Grain Initiative could exacerbate global food insecurity and hunger by increasing food prices and creating shortages, particularly affecting low- and middle-income countries that depend on grain exports from Ukraine and Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Renewal uncertainties of the initiative and rising commodity prices, coupled with high food price inflation, suggest that food prices are expected to remain elevated through the end of 2024, worsening existing food crises <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative by Russia could exacerbate global food insecurity by weaponizing food supplies, affecting those in low- and middle-income countries by increasing food prices and threatening hunger <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The war has already created a food crisis, with Russia and Ukraine being significant exporters of essential grains such as wheat, barley, and maize, which impacts the global food supply and the operations of organizations like the World Food Programme <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The recent decline in global food staple prices could reverse, causing a resurgence in price increases for commodities like wheat and maize if the initiative is not renewed, adding to the challenges of ensuring food security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Furthermore, delays to shipments under the initiative, with over 150 vessels waiting, could disrupt the supply chain and port operations, leading to further potential impacts on global food availability <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The potential collapse of the Black Sea Grain Initiative poses a significant threat to global food security, especially as it could lead to increased food prices and exacerbate hunger crises worldwide. The Initiative has been crucial in stabilizing food prices and combating global hunger by allowing the export of millions of tons of grain from Ukraine's ports, accounting for a considerable percentage of global wheat, barley, and maize exports <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. With its suspension, Russia is accused of weaponizing food and affecting low- and middle-income countries that are already suffering from food insecurity, heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Should the Initiative end, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization warns of rising commodity prices, such as wheat and maize, further threatening food security, particularly in developing and least developed countries <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The World Bank has also highlighted that the war in Ukraine has disrupted global trade, production, and consumption patterns, suggesting that high food prices could persist through the end of 2024, worsening food insecurity and inflation. Additionally, the UN has called for urgent measures to prevent delays to shipments under the Initiative, as over 150 vessels are currently waiting, potentially causing supply chain disruptions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The collapse of the Initiative would thus remove a vital lifeline that has been mitigating the food crisis, with dire consequences for global food availability and prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

## Claims
| Claim Sentence | Source | Context |
|---|---|---|
|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> In suspending this arrangement, Russia is again weaponizing food in the war it started, directly impacting low- and middle-income countries and global food prices, and exacerbating already dire humanitarian crises and food insecurity.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.state.gov/suspension-of-the-black-sea-grain-initiative/" target="_blank">state.gov</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| It has been a success and must continue. Any act by Russia to disrupt these critical grain exports is essentially a statement that people and families around the world should pay more for food or go hungry. In suspending this arrangement, Russia is again weaponizing food in the war it started, directly impacting low- and middle-income countries and global food prices, and exacerbating already dire humanitarian crises and food insecurity. We urge the Government of Russia to resume its participation in the Initiative, fully comply with the arrangement, and work to ensure that people around the world continue to be able to receive the benefits facilitated by the Initiative.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Even the World Food Programme itself gets 50% of its grain supplies from the Ukraine-Russia area and is now facing dramatic cost increases in its efforts to combat food emergencies around the world.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://intellinews.com/why-the-war-in-ukraine-threatens-global-food-security-260541/" target="_blank">intellinews.com</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The head of the United Nations World Food Programme, David Beasly, recently warned that the war was creating a food crisis "beyond anything weve seen since World War II", leading to surging food prices and possibly shortages in many countries that rely on exports from Russia or Ukraine. As the following chart, based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), shows, Ukraine and Russia are major producers of wheat, barley and maize, accounting for an average (combined) share of 27%, 23% and 15% of global exports between 2016 and 2020 respectively. Even the World Food Programme itself gets 50% of its grain supplies from the Ukraine-Russia area and is now facing dramatic cost increases in its efforts to combat food emergencies around the world. "This is a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe," WFP director Beasley said, referring to the devastating effect the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had on world hunger.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Without the initiative, there is little hope for providing food security, especially in developing and least developed countries.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://unctad.org/news/black-sea-grain-initiative-offers-hope-shows-power-trade" target="_blank">unctad.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 20th, 2022</div></div>| The Food Price Index published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has shown that the prices of global food staples have declined in recent months by about 8.6% in July, 1.9% in August and 1.1% in September. But with the initiative ending in November and its renewal uncertain, the prices of some commodities, such as wheat and maize, are rising again, the report warns. Without the initiative, there is little hope for providing food security, especially in developing and least developed countries. Increasing port activity|

Ukrainian officials have claimed that Moscow is intentionally slowing down food shipments made under the agreement signed in July by Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the UN. Palla confirmed there are currently "over 150 vessels waiting around Istanbul to move, and these delays have the potential to cause disruptions to the supply chain and port operations." She told CNN that the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) comprised of representatives from Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and the UN has acknowledged the problem of delays and is discussing ways to address the backlog.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> "The war in Ukraine has altered global patterns of trade, production and consumption of commodities in ways that will keep prices at high levels through the end of 2024, exacerbating food insecurity and inflation," commented the World Bank.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.intellinews.com/food-waste-apps-gain-users-as-cost-of-living-soars-259082/" target="_blank">intellinews.com</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Sky-high food prices arent likely to ease any time soon. According to a World Bank update on September 15, food price inflation remains high around the world, affecting almost all low-income and middle-income countries, and most high-income countries too. "The war in Ukraine has altered global patterns of trade, production and consumption of commodities in ways that will keep prices at high levels through the end of 2024, exacerbating food insecurity and inflation," commented the World Bank. "Not only are consumers looking at cheaper food alternatives, but also, they are increasingly driven by eco-friendly consumer behaviours," said Vigroux.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Kubrakov said almost 7.7 million tons of agricultural products have been exported since the launch of the initiative, which "has stabilized food prices and countered the threat of global hunger."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-10-16-22/h_0f298f6abd1f25d1c1add8eb5ef69527" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 16th, 2022</div></div>| Some background: The Black Sea Grain Initiative which was brokered by the UN and Turkey was signed by representatives from Russia and Ukraine in July. The agreement ended five months of Russian blockade, allowing ships carrying grain from Ukrainian ports in Odesa to navigate a safe corridor through the Black Sea, helping alleviate global food shortages. Kubrakov said almost 7.7 million tons of agricultural products have been exported since the launch of the initiative, which "has stabilized food prices and countered the threat of global hunger." Russia casts doubt: Gennady Gatilov, Russia's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said this week that Russia could leave the deal, according to Reuters.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> "It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people," Stphane Dujarric, the spokesman for Antnio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/29/world/russia-ukraine-war-news" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Oct 29th, 2022</div></div>| In recent weeks, its future had appeared uncertain. The United Nations said Saturday that it was in touch with the Russian authorities regarding the reports that Russia was suspending participation. "It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people," Stphane Dujarric, the spokesman for Antnio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said. Ukraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government had warned that Russia would try to upend the deal.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Since the deal was clinched on July 22, several millions of tonnes of corn, wheat, sunflower products, barley, rapeseed and soya have been exported from Ukraine's Black Sea ports.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-use-un-grain-deal-leverage-g20-european-diplomat-says-2022-10-26/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 26th, 2022</div></div>| "It is a way for the Russians to hold the cards at the G20 summit but a rollover or a longer term extension to the grain deal doesnt cost them anything." The United Nations-brokered grain deal is crucial for food markets: it allows the export of grain from Ukraine, one of the worlds largest grain exporters, that the Russian invasion had halted. Since the deal was clinched on July 22, several millions of tonnes of corn, wheat, sunflower products, barley, rapeseed and soya have been exported from Ukraine's Black Sea ports. Leaders at the G20 will push Putin to extend the deal, the diplomat said.|

The climate crisis has had an impact on the environmental and social determinants of health across Africa, leading to devastating health effects, explain the authors. In West and Central Africa, for example, severe flooding resulted in mortality and forced migration from loss of shelter, cultivated land, and livestock, while extreme weather damages water and food supply, increasing food insecurity and malnutrition, which causes 1.7 million deaths annually in Africa. Changes in vector ecology brought about by floods and damage to environmental hygiene has also led to increases in malaria, dengue fever, Ebola virus, and other infectious diseases across sub-Saharan Africa.|
