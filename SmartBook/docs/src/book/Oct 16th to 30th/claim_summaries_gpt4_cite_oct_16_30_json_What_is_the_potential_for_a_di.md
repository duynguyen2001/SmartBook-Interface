# What is the potential for a dirty bomb to be used by non-state actors, and how does this compare to the likelihood of state-sponsored use?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The potential for non-state actors to use a dirty bomb is a significant concern for security experts due to its ability to spread fear and economic disruption without causing a large-scale explosion, making it a preferred terrorist weapon over traditional military devices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. In contrast, accusations of state-sponsored use, such as Russia's claim against Ukraine, are often viewed skeptically by international observers and may serve as a pretext for further escalation rather than reflecting a genuine likelihood of use by a nation-state <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The potential for non-state actors, such as terrorists, to use dirty bombs is a significant concern for security experts, as these weapons are designed to spread fear and panic rather than cause large-scale destruction <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Dirty bombs combine conventional explosives with radioactive material, like uranium, and are considered more accessible to terrorists because they are less technically complex than nuclear weapons and are intended to contaminate areas with radiation, potentially causing economic and psychological damage rather than immediate mass casualties <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This potential for disruption without the need for sophisticated technology makes dirty bombs an attractive option for terrorists looking to sow terror and cause long-term harm to urban centers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In contrast, the likelihood of state-sponsored use of dirty bombs is generally considered lower, as countries typically have access to more powerful conventional and strategic weapons. However, Russia's recent accusations against Ukraine of planning to use a dirty bomb, which have been dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies as a possible false-flag operation, illustrate that the threat of states leveraging such allegations for strategic purposes cannot be entirely dismissed <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. While Ukraine invited UN inspectors to prove they have nothing to hide, the Russian claim has raised concerns about escalation and the potential for misuse of dirty bomb rhetoric in international conflicts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite these concerns, the intentional contamination of one's own land with a dirty bomb seems an unlikely and irrational act for a state, particularly one under the threat of invasion, as it would cause long-term damage to their own environment and population <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

## Claims
| Claim Sentence | Source | Context |
|---|---|---|
|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Experts say the immediate health impact would probably be limited, since most people in an affected area would be able to escape before experiencing lethal doses of radiation.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-is-dirty-bomb-why-is-russia-talking-about-one-now-2022-10-25/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 25th, 2022</div></div>| Dirty bombs do not create city-flattening atomic explosion but are designed to spread toxic waste. Security experts have worried about them mostly as a form of terrorist weapon to be used on cities to cause havoc among civilians, rather than as a tactical device for use by warring parties in conflict. Experts say the immediate health impact would probably be limited, since most people in an affected area would be able to escape before experiencing lethal doses of radiation. But the economic damage could be massive from having to evacuate urban areas or even abandon whole cities.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> They are often referred to as weapons for terrorists, not countries, as they're designed to spread fear and panic more than eliminate any military target.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-10-27-22/h_cb114a9a891c7d404633a1aac973afea" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 27th, 2022</div></div>| What is a dirty bomb? The weapons in question combine conventional explosives like dynamite with radioactive material like uranium. They are often referred to as weapons for terrorists, not countries, as they're designed to spread fear and panic more than eliminate any military target. What does Russia claim?|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> It is often referred to as a weapon for terrorists, not countries, as it is designed to spread fear and panic more than eliminate any military target.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-10-25-22/h_047d103a7f851ebb32f47b45678d00f5" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 25th, 2022</div></div>| Russia is accusing Ukraine ofplanning to use a so-called dirty bomb, an allegation dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies as a false-flag operation that Moscow could use as a pretext to escalate the Kremlin'swar against its neighbor. A dirty bomb is a weapon that combines conventional explosives like dynamite and radioactive material like uranium. It is often referred to as a weapon for terrorists, not countries, as it is designed to spread fear and panic more than eliminate any military target. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly denied Moscow's accusations and Kyiv's foreign minister has invited UN inspectors to visit Ukraine to show they "have nothing to hide."|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Such weapons don't have the devastating destruction of a nuclear explosion but could expose broad areas to radioactive contamination that could last for years.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-1.6629870" target="_blank">CBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| It was the first time Putin himself made the dirty bomb allegation. A dirty bomb uses explosives to scatter radioactive waste in an effort to sow terror. Such weapons don't have the devastating destruction of a nuclear explosion but could expose broad areas to radioactive contamination that could last for years. Western allies have dismissed as absurd the idea that Ukraine would contaminate its own land with toxic waste when Russia is on its back foot on the battlefield.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> A "dirty bomb" is not a nuclear bomb, and would be less harmful, but by using conventional explosives to spread radioactive material, it is an effective weapon of terror.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nato-russia-ukraine-dirty-bomb/" target="_blank">CBS News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| "Something bad" could be a "dirty bomb" an explosive loaded with radioactive material. Russia claims Ukraine wants to use one on the battlefield, although there is no evidence to support the allegation. A "dirty bomb" is not a nuclear bomb, and would be less harmful, but by using conventional explosives to spread radioactive material, it is an effective weapon of terror. Stoltenberg said the accusation could be a strategic tactic from Russia, foreshadowing what it aims to do instead.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> More creative non-nuclear attacks should also not be ruled out: for example a dirty bomb (which Russia recently accused Ukraine of preparing to use in a false flag operation), a massive cyber strike, a limited poison gas attack against Ukrainian troops (as happened in Syria), the destruction of a major dam, or more severe attacks on a Ukrainian nuclear power plant.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/putins-next-escalation-is-coming-how-should-the-west-respond/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 28th, 2022</div></div>| However, a strike against a city in Western Ukraine cannot be ruled out. His purpose would be to turn European and especially German opinion against further support for Ukraine and to convince Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he has no option but to accept a settlement on Russias terms. More creative non-nuclear attacks should also not be ruled out: for example a dirty bomb (which Russia recently accused Ukraine of preparing to use in a false flag operation), a massive cyber strike, a limited poison gas attack against Ukrainian troops (as happened in Syria), the destruction of a major dam, or more severe attacks on a Ukrainian nuclear power plant. Is Putin bluffing?|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> There are, however, some inherent issues with this concept that limit a bomb makers chances of success.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/us/politics/dirty-bomb-russia-ukraine.html" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Oct 25th, 2022</div></div>| The most commonly imagined version is small enough to fit in a backpack and contains perhaps 20 pounds or less of explosives, with a smaller mass of radioactive material placed on top. Thats about the extent of it, though such a weapon potentially could be made much larger. There are, however, some inherent issues with this concept that limit a bomb makers chances of success. First, the size of the main charge: Use too much explosive material and the radioactive substance could be largely consumed by the intense heat as the bomb detonates.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The goal of using a dirty bomb may not be maximal destruction, but rather an attempt to "create fear and panic, contaminate property, and require potentially costly cleanup," it explains.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/24/dirty-bomb-russia-ukraine-war/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 24th, 2022</div></div>| Dirty bombs are far less powerful: Their "radiation could be dispersed within a few blocks or miles of the explosion," according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. As the department notes, the explosive substance in a dirty bomb is more likely to cause harm to humans than the radioactive material it carries. The goal of using a dirty bomb may not be maximal destruction, but rather an attempt to "create fear and panic, contaminate property, and require potentially costly cleanup," it explains. Shoigus claims that Ukraine would use a dirty bomb are particularly sensitive because Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for a guarantee from Russia that it would not attack Ukraine.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Despite its potential for harm, the scale of destruction from a dirty bomb is in no way comparable to the detonation of a tactical or strategic nuclear weapon.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/10/russia-says-ukraine-is-preparing-a-dirty-bomb-is-it-true-and-what-does-it-mean/" target="_blank">thebulletin.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 27th, 2022</div></div>| On the other hand, the cleanup costs of an incident and other economic losses might be enormous. As a example, remember the cleanup costs associated with the post-9/11 anthrax letters." Despite its potential for harm, the scale of destruction from a dirty bomb is in no way comparable to the detonation of a tactical or strategic nuclear weapon. As Elisabeth Eaves noted in a 2016 Bulletin article: "Dirty bombs have more in common with nuclear medicine than nuclear war"|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Such a bomb is not a nuclear device; it has none of the explosive power of a nuclear weapon.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/politics/russia-dirty-bomb-west-ukraine.html" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Oct 24th, 2022</div></div>| The Russian defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, had claimed over the weekend that Ukraine was preparing to detonate a "dirty bomb, a phrase that describes a conventional explosive, like dynamite, that is wrapped with radiological waste. In a series of phone calls on Monday with NATO nations, Moscows top military commander, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, repeated the allegation. Such a bomb is not a nuclear device; it has none of the explosive power of a nuclear weapon. But it is an effective weapon of terror, and the resulting radiological contamination can make several city blocks uninhabitable for a period of time.|
