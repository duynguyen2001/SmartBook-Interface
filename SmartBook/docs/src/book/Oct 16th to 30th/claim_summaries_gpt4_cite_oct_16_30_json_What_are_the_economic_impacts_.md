## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The Russia-Ukraine war has led to a significant rise in energy and agricultural product prices, affecting global economic stability and resulting in tighter financial conditions and currency depreciations in Asia due to increased commodity prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Western nations face the challenge of financing Ukraine's reconstruction amidst a major economic downturn and considering severe sanctions on Russia that could have further implications for the global economy, should nuclear weapons be used <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The Russia-Ukraine war has led to rising energy and agricultural product prices, severely impacting the global economy, particularly Asia, where most countries have experienced worsening terms of trade and currency depreciations due to high commodity prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Ukraine's economy has been devastated by the conflict, with a significant GDP contraction, massive refugee displacement, and reliance on Western financial support to cover government deficits <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. For Russia, the threat of increased sanctions, including a potential full economic, financial, and trade embargo comparable to those on Iran or North Korea, looms if nuclear weapons are used, which could severely isolate its economy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Additionally, the loss of strategic territories like Kherson would not only undermine Russia's military objectives but also deal a significant blow to its economy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Russia-Ukraine war has led to significant global economic repercussions, particularly in the domains of energy and agriculture, with prices for these commodities experiencing considerable increases <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The conflict has not only caused a surge in commodity prices but also contributed to the deterioration of terms of trade and currency depreciations across many Asian countries, leading to tighter financial conditions within the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Moreover, the war has devastated Ukraine's economy, shrinking its GDP by roughly one-third and resulting in substantial government deficits, mainly financed by Western grants <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The potential for a nuclear incident has prompted discussions on imposing more severe sanctions on Russia, which would involve a full economic, financial, and trade embargo, further isolating the country internationally <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>On a broader scale, the war has intensified a global energy crisis, with natural gas prices reaching record highs and subsequently driving up electricity costs in some markets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. This crisis has prompted shifts towards renewable energy sources and electric vehicles, somewhat mitigating the rise in global CO2 emissions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The international community's response to the conflict includes forming coalitions to reinforce sanctions, freezing Russian central bank assets, and contemplating the use of seized Russian financial assets for Ukrainian reconstruction <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The crisis has also sparked discussions about the acceleration of Ukraine's integration with European structures, including potential EU membership <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Collectively, these economic impacts and strategic responses underscore the profound and lasting implications of the Russia-Ukraine war on the global economy.

The second headwind is the war in Ukraine. The main impact on Asia has been through commodities prices, which spiked following the invasion and have remained high. Mostbut not allcountries in Asia have seen a deterioration of their terms of trade, and this has been an important factor behind currency depreciations so far this year.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Millions of refugees have fled, the countrys gross domestic product has shrunk by about one-third, and the government, its budget depleted by the war, runs monthly deficits of $4 billion or more mainly financed by Western grants, a lifeline for teachers, retirees living on pensions and millions of others.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://euromaidanpress.com/2022/10/23/russo-ukrainian-war-day-242-russian-strikes-on-infrastructure-left-1-5-mn-ukrainians-without-electricity/" target="_blank">euromaidanpress.com</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 23rd, 2022</div></div>| A $1 trillion question for the West: How to rebuild shattered Ukraine, the Editorial Board at The Washington Post asks. "Beyond Ukraines stunning recent battlefield successes, eight months of war have rendered the country a physical, financial and economic basket case. Millions of refugees have fled, the countrys gross domestic product has shrunk by about one-third, and the government, its budget depleted by the war, runs monthly deficits of $4 billion or more mainly financed by Western grants, a lifeline for teachers, retirees living on pensions and millions of others. Even if Russia were to withdraw now, Ukraine would remain enfeebled for years.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> The G7 and EU countries have imposed extraordinary sanctions thus far over Russias invasion of Ukraine, but in large part, they have also been measured in their steps to avoid negative spillover to the global economy.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-to-respond-if-putin-goes-nuclear-here-are-the-economic-and-political-options/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 20th, 2022</div></div>| Impose a full economic, financial, and trade embargo. Turning Russia into Iran or North Korea, economically, should be the moral and logical starting point for any Russian use of a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The G7 and EU countries have imposed extraordinary sanctions thus far over Russias invasion of Ukraine, but in large part, they have also been measured in their steps to avoid negative spillover to the global economy. Any nuclear weapon use by Putin in Ukraine must eviscerate any thoughts of a measured escalatory ladder.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Such a move would deal a devastating blow to its economy.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/22/explainer-what-would-retreat-from-kherson-mean-for-russia" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 22nd, 2022</div></div>| What would losing Kherson mean for Russia? A retreat from Kherson and other areas on the Dniepers west bank would shatter Russian hopes to press an offensive west to Mykolaiv and Odesa to cut off Ukraines access to the Black Sea. Such a move would deal a devastating blow to its economy. It would also allow Moscow to potentially build a land corridor to the separatist Transnistria region of Moldova, home to a crucial Russian military base.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Furthermore, sanctions (administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury) are having a significant impact on Russias ability to wage its unjust war against Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.state.gov/the-impact-of-sanctions-and-export-controls-on-the-russian-federation/" target="_blank">state.gov</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Formed a coalition of 37 countries that has amplified the impact of U.S. actions by applying substantially similar controls to those imposed by the United States. This robust global coalition reinforces U.S. efforts to isolate Russia from commodities, technologies, and software necessary for Putins war. Furthermore, sanctions (administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury) are having a significant impact on Russias ability to wage its unjust war against Ukraine. Specifically, sanctions implemented by the United States along with Allies and partners and allies have immobilized about $300 billion worth of Russian Central Bank assets, limiting the central banks ability to aid the war effort and mitigate sanctions impacts.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> But the situation escalated dramatically into a full-blown global energy crisis following Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.iea.org/topics/global-energy-crisis" target="_blank">iea.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Energy markets began to tighten in 2021 because of a variety of factors, including the extraordinarily rapid economic rebound following the pandemic. But the situation escalated dramatically into a full-blown global energy crisis following Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The price of natural gas reached record highs, and as a result so did electricity in some markets.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Global energy trends have also been affected this year by the impacts of Russias war on the world economy, which have significantly dampened expectations for economic growth, notably in Europe.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.iea.org/news/defying-expectations-co2-emissions-from-global-fossil-fuel-combustion-are-set-to-grow-in-2022-by-only-a-fraction-of-last-year-s-big-increase" target="_blank">iea.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The rise in global CO2 emissions this year would be much larger more than tripling to reach close to 1 billion tonnes were it not for the major deployments of renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles (EVs) around the world. Even though the energy crisis sparked by Russias invasion of Ukraine has propped up global coal demand in 2022 by making natural gas far more expensive, the relatively small increase in coal emissions has been considerably outweighed by the expansion of renewables. Global energy trends have also been affected this year by the impacts of Russias war on the world economy, which have significantly dampened expectations for economic growth, notably in Europe. The combined result is that the CO2 intensity of the worlds energy supply is set to improve slightly in 2022, resuming a years-long trend of consistent improvement that was disrupted last year by the emissions-intensive economic recovery from the Covid crisis.|
