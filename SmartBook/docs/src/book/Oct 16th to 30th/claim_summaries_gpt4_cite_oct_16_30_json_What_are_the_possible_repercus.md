The suspension of the U.N.-brokered grain export deal by Russia, following an alleged Ukrainian drone attack, threatens to exacerbate the global food crisis as it halts the export of Ukrainian grain, which has been a key measure in reducing food prices worldwide <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This interruption endangers the upcoming planting seasons, as it may lead to a scarcity of affordable fertilizers, potentially impacting food production and prices in 2023 and 2024, turning the crisis of affordability into one of availability <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The geopolitical ramifications could intensify existing tensions, as countries already facing severe hunger may suffer further, potentially leading to increased political instability in regions dependent on these food imports <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Additionally, the strain on food supply could have knock-on effects on energy markets, as countries may compete more aggressively for limited resources to secure their national interests <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The suspension of the U.N.-brokered grain deal by Russia following an alleged Ukrainian drone attack on its Black Sea Fleet could escalate global food crises, as the agreement facilitated the export of over 9 million tons of Ukrainian grain, mitigating soaring food prices and shortages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Before the conflict, Russia and Ukraine were prominent contributors to the world's grain market, and the blockade of Black Sea ports had previously hindered millions of tons of grain exports from Ukraine until the deal was brokered <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The cessation of grain shipments risks exacerbating food scarcity, particularly in regions dependent on these exports for sustenance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the suspension might intensify geopolitical tensions, with potential ramifications for energy markets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The grain deal was pivotal in ensuring the availability of food and fertilizers at affordable prices before the planting season, which is crucial for global food production <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This could lead to a "crisis of availability" if not addressed promptly, influencing energy and food linkages as countries may seek to secure resources amidst increasing competition and scarcity <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The U.N. Secretary-General's delayed departure to the Arab League Summit highlights the urgency of the matter, signaling the gravity of the situation at the geopolitical level <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

She touted the "tremendous success" of the deal so far, crediting it with lowering global food prices and providing relief to those "most vulnerable to severe hunger."

However, Moscow's blockade of Black Sea ports earlier this year stalled millions of tons of grain exports from Ukraine. TheBlack Sea Grain Initiative brokered in July by the UN and Turkey ended months of the blockade, allowing grain ships to navigate a safe corridor through the Black Sea, helping alleviate global food shortages. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the importance of the deal, adding that since July Ukraine has exported 8 million tons of food by sea.|

Since Aug. 1, the grain deal struck in Istanbul has resulted in 380 vessels carrying 8.5 million tonnes of agricultural products from Ukraines Black Sea ports to countries in Africa, Asia and Europe, according to the ministry. The deal has eased a world food crisis, but as more shippers have joined, the handful of inspection teams has fallen behind. Concerns have been raised by trade specialists about the wait time for vessels due to reduced numbers of inspections, which have been significantly less than the 12 supposed to be conducted each day.|

And while China dominates foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country, and holdings of Tajik debt, there is no chance it will change its approach to Russia on the basis of Rahmons actions. What Rahmon aims to achieve remains uncertain. But whether it is Putins approach to the Kyrgyz border, or just an attempt to demand more investments (and thus the size of the pie that Rahmons family and associates can feast on), it is the latest indication that something has fundamentally changed in Russias geo-strategic position even in the former Soviet near abroad following the folly of his 24 February full-blown invasion of Ukraine.|

Despite that, Ukraines infrastructure minister voiced optimism about the deal earlier this month, saying "there is no doubt that the grain corridor will continue operating after Nov. 22," when it is set to expire. The World Food Programme estimated that tens of millions of people moved into a stage of acute hunger as a consequence of the Ukraine war, and Western officials have accused Russia of using food as a weapon during its invasion. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told CNN Saturday: "Weve seen the reports from the Russian Federation regarding the suspension of their participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative following an attack on the Russian Black Sea Fleet.|
