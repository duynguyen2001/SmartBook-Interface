# What are the potential long-term consequences of drone warfare for the principles and practices of international armed conflict?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Drone warfare, as a low-tech and unreliable substitute for precision artillery strikes, reflects deeper military weaknesses and may represent a Band-Aid solution rather than a strategic advantage in international conflicts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The reliance on drones can lead to a prolonged conflict by targeting infrastructure, thereby impacting economies and civilian morale, potentially destabilizing the region over the long term <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.
</template>
<template v-slot:summary>
The employment of drones in conflicts such as the ongoing war in Ukraine has revealed their limitations, including reliability issues and vulnerability to countermeasures like jamming, which indicates that they are not a definitive solution to military challenges but rather a stopgap for broader strategic weaknesses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. These drones are being used as a substitute for other capabilities, which Russia is currently lacking, such as precision artillery strikes, thereby highlighting a deeper issue within Russian military operations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. However, the reliance on such technology, including the bombardment of Ukrainian infrastructure, could potentially extend the conflict by undermining the Ukrainian economy and dampening hopes for a return to normalcy, despite the questionable impact on the Ukrainian resolve <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The long-term implications for international armed conflict include the normalization of using less reliable, low-tech solutions that could prolong warfare and economic damage to the targeted regions, while not necessarily leading to decisive outcomes or forcing opponents to negotiate <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The increasing reliance on drones in armed conflict, such as seen in the Ukraine conflict, indicates a shift towards warfare methods that can perpetuate fighting by targeting critical infrastructure while minimizing the need for direct confrontation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Drones are often considered a Band-Aid solution to compensate for military weaknesses, as they are low-tech and can be susceptible to countermeasures like jamming, yet they still pose a significant threat due to their ability to disrupt daily life and extend wars indefinitely by affecting economies and hopes for normalcy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. These unmanned systems are emerging as game-changers on the battlefield, with their ability to evade traditional defenses highlighting the need for new countermeasures like electronic warfare systems to protect against drone strikes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The use of drones has also raised concerns regarding the principles of international armed conflict, as their utilization can lead to escalations that challenge established norms. The deployment of drones by Russia in Ukraine has prompted discussions about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons and the severe consequences that would follow, suggesting that the threshold for nuclear conflict could be influenced by the presence of drones in warfare <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the international community's response to the drone threat, including providing air defense systems to Ukraine, underscores the urgency to address the humanitarian implications of drone warfare and the need to protect civilians from aerial attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The long-term consequences of drone warfare thus include the potential erosion of international norms and the heightened risk of escalation, as well as the pressing humanitarian need to mitigate the impact of drones on civilian populations and infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

The approach may be unlikely to force Ukrainians to the bargaining table, experts said. "Bombardment is very weak efficacy, and typically only builds resolve," said Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at C.N.A., a defense research institute based in Virginia. But as Russian forces struggle on the battlefield, such strikes on infrastructure targets may allow the Kremlin to extend the war indefinitely by squeezing the Ukrainian economy and quashing any hope of a return to normalcy, a hope raised by Ukraines recent military successes.|

"At the same time, the drones are being forced to substitute for other capabilities, including precision artillery strike, that Russia is short of," Tuck said. "Fundamentally, they are a Band-Aid solution to deeper Russian military weakness."|

Biden rightly decided that the United States should not directly enter the conflict and risk World War III over a part of Europe that, while important, is not vital to U.S. national interests. We take that decision for granted, but it remains enormously important, given the potential for escalation in any direct fight between nuclear-armed superpowers that involves a major interest of at least one of them. Biden did, however, help lead a Western response in the economic realm that has cut off most high-tech cooperation between the West and Russia (even if it has not yet substantially reduced Russian oil and gas export earnings or brought the economy to its knees).|

It is rather than taking a stand for peace, for prosperity, security, and freedom of the American people, we have too many people in Washington who are war mongers, subservient to the military industrial complex, and continuing to put their own selfish interests with the interests of their donors first, with no mind for the costs and consequences that their decisions have on the American people. This is exactly what we're seeing right now with President Biden and leaders in Congress whose decisions are actively pushing us to the brink of a nuclear holocaust, of which they may have their bunkers where they'll be saved, but we, the American people will have no shelter, no place to go, no place to hide and face the consequences that could destroy all of humanity and the world, as we know it.

By reducing output, OPEC Plus was also seeking to make a statement to energy markets about the groups cohesion during the Ukraine war and its willingness to act quickly to defend prices, analysts say. At a news conference after the meeting, the Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said OPEC Plus was acting amid signs of a downturn in the world economy that might cause demand for oil to weaken and prices to fall. "We would rather be pre-emptive than be sorry," he said.|

Mr. Biden recently said that the United States would "respond forcefully" if Mr. Putin uses a tactical nuclear weapon. In May he wrote in an essay for The Times that "any use of nuclear weapons in this conflict on any scale" would "entail severe consequences." His national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sept. 25 there would be "catastrophic consequences" and those had been communicated to Moscow.|

These guns are designed to neutralize small and medium-sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and can identify and actively disrupt UAV guidance, tracking, and navigation systems. The small size of drones and their ability to move quickly makes it very difficult for kinetic weapons like nets, bullets, and missiles to detect, target, and attack them; therefore, in recent years, weaponized drones are emerging as game-changers on the battlefield, such as in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and the Libyan Civil War. In the wake of mounting UAV threats, the Ukrainian army ordered hand-held electronic warfare systems to counter drones.|

In the wake of several days of Russian missile strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been calling for more international assistance in the form of air defense systems. In his nightly address Wednesday, he said "the more audacious and cruel Russian terror becomes, the more obvious it is to the world that helping Ukraine to protect the sky is one of the most important humanitarian tasks for Europe." Power and water supplies are still damaged in a number of regions after Russia targeted critical infrastructure across the country in strikes on Monday and Tuesday and, to a lesser extent, yesterday.|
