<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The international community has responded with skepticism and dismissal to Russia's allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb. Russia's claims have been strongly refuted by Ukraine, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and NATO. These entities have accused Moscow of potentially staging a false-flag operation that could be used to justify further aggression. The unsubstantiated nature of the allegations has been highlighted by Western officials, and the narrative is rejected broadly. Ukraine has defended itself by inviting UN inspectors to verify its position, showing transparency and a willingness to prove that it has nothing to hide <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In addition to verbal refutations, the United States has shown support for Ukraine, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterating this stance in a call with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. This support comes in the face of Russia's baseless accusations and is part of the broader international effort to counter the Russian narrative. The invitation of UN inspectors by Ukraine is a strategic move to provide tangible evidence against the Russian claims. The international community's firm and united response serves to undermine Russia's credibility and highlights a collective approach to managing the conflict's disinformation aspect <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

It is often referred to as a weapon for terrorists, not countries, as it is designed to spread fear and panic more than eliminate any military target. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly denied Moscow's accusations and Kyiv's foreign minister has invited UN inspectors to visit Ukraine to show they "have nothing to hide."

|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> For more than 30 years, the U.S. and its Asian allies have responded to North Korean demonstrations of ever-advancing weapons technology with their own shows of force.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/time-magazine-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://time.com/6219676/north-korea-nuclear-missile-biden/" target="_blank">Time Magazine</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 6th, 2022</div></div>| On Wednesday, the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan was moved off the east coast of the Korean peninsula. Within hours Pyongyang launched another missile into the Sea of Japan and then, on Thursday, flew 12 fighter jets and bombers near its border with South Korea, triggering the South to scramble 30 warplanes in response. For more than 30 years, the U.S. and its Asian allies have responded to North Korean demonstrations of ever-advancing weapons technology with their own shows of force. But the escalation spiral of the last few days is the latest indication that coercive tactics by the U.S. and its allies are failing to compel North Korea to curtail its missile and nuclear programs.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Western officials are engaged in "prudent planning" behind the scenes to prevent chaos and panic in their home countries in the event Russia was to detonate a nuclear bomb in or near Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/14/west-plans-avoid-panic-if-russia-nuclear-bomb-ukraine-putin" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 14th, 2022</div></div>| Western officials are engaged in "prudent planning" behind the scenes to prevent chaos and panic in their home countries in the event Russia was to detonate a nuclear bomb in or near Ukraine. Although a nuclear crisis is considered highly unlikely, the insider said officials internationally were re-examining plans to provide emergency support and reassurance to populations fearful of nuclear escalation.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> In a report published after the mission, the IAEA called for the "immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone" around the NPP and subsequently voted for a resolution calling on Russia to leave the NPP, which Russia said it would not do.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/ukraine-quarterly-digest-july-september-2022" target="_blank">wilsoncenter.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| IAEA Visit. On September 1, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission arrived at Zaporizhzhia NPP for an inspection and remained there until September 5 , with two inspectors remaining indefinitely at the site thereafter to monitor the situation. In a report published after the mission, the IAEA called for the "immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone" around the NPP and subsequently voted for a resolution calling on Russia to leave the NPP, which Russia said it would not do. The capture of the Zaporizhzhia NPP by the Russian army poses a vast range of threats, including radiation accidents, energy deficits, security and economic losses, and industrial espionage.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Putin has repeatedly alluded to using his country's vast nuclear arsenal, including last month when he announced plans to conscript Russian men to serve in Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/arkansas-democrat-gazette" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2022/oct/08/bidens-nuke-war-remark-echoing/" target="_blank">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 8th, 2022</div></div>| One U.S. official said Biden was also trying to warn against underestimating the danger of any level of tactical nuclear weapons. There's some concern in the administration that Russia has determined it can use its nuclear arsenal in a manner short of a "full-blown" nuclear attack on Ukraine and face only limited reaction from U.S. and Western allies who are determined to keep the Ukraine conflict from turning into a broader war, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss administration thinking. Putin has repeatedly alluded to using his country's vast nuclear arsenal, including last month when he announced plans to conscript Russian men to serve in Ukraine. "I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction ... and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal," Putin said.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> It's just over two weeks ago that a series of blasts on the Nord Stream pipelines connecting Russia to Germany provoked an international outcry and widespread suspicions in the West that the blasts were a deliberate act of sabotage.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/12/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 12th, 2022</div></div>| "Who is behind the subversion of the Nord Streams? Obviously, it's the one who seeks to finally cut off the ties between Russia and the EU, seeks to finish off and undermine the political subjectness of Europe, weaken its industrial potential and control the market," Putin said at the Russian Energy Week forum in Moscow on Wednesday, without naming the U.S. It's just over two weeks ago that a series of blasts on the Nord Stream pipelines connecting Russia to Germany provoked an international outcry and widespread suspicions in the West that the blasts were a deliberate act of sabotage. Suspicions fell on Moscow, which denied any involvement in the incidents and in turn insinuated that NATO could have carried out the damage, an accusation firmly rebuffed by the West.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Despite this paradigm shift in the waging of modern warfare, and the civilian harm it has caused, the international community has been slow to respond imaginatively and decisively to address the realities of improvisation.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://aoav.org.uk/2022/how-to-address-the-harms-from-ieds/" target="_blank">aoav.org.uk</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 12th, 2022</div></div>| One would therefore expect the same level of assurance (whether this be training, equipment, information management or human factors) being discharged to those conducting humanitarian IED clearance operations in semi-permissive and permissive environments. Such safeguarding is, after all, afforded to mine clearance in those environments. Despite this paradigm shift in the waging of modern warfare, and the civilian harm it has caused, the international community has been slow to respond imaginatively and decisively to address the realities of improvisation. With exceptions, uncertainty at donor level remains about the scope of IED disposal (IEDD) that is suitable and appropriate for funding.|
