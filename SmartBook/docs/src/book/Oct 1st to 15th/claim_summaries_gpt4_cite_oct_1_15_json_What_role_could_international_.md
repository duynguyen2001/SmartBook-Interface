International cooperation and assistance play a pivotal role in bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities against kamikaze drone attacks. NATO's Comprehensive Assistance Package, which includes the imminent delivery of counter-drone equipment, is a significant initiative aimed at mitigating the threats posed by Russian and Iranian-made drones. The package is designed to supply fuel, winter clothing, medical supplies, and crucially, hundreds of drone jammers that can help protect Ukrainian people and critical infrastructure by rendering these drones ineffective <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Additionally, Ukraine's allies have demonstrated their commitment to the country's defense by promising advanced air defense systems, which are essential in countering the kamikaze drones used by Russian forces in various regions, including attacks on the Kyiv region and other civilian targets. These systems are intended to provide medium- to long-range defense against the missile attacks that have been a persistent threat to Ukraine's security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The United States has made a considerable contribution to Ukraine's military strength by providing around $15 billion in weapons, including precision missiles, artillery systems, and other essential support equipment, alongside significant intelligence support to ensure effective use of these resources <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The UK's pledge to supply missiles for NASAM anti-aircraft systems and additional drones for reconnaissance and support further amplifies the collective effort to enhance Ukraine's air defense capabilities. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg emphasized the impact of such aid, noting that Ukrainian air defense systems, supplied by NATO allies, have been successful in shooting down many incoming missiles, underscoring the importance of expanding Ukraine's existing weaponry <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Additionally, the U.S. has fast-tracked the delivery of NASAMS following the Crimean Bridge attack, and Germany has already delivered the IRIS-T system to Ukraine, indicating a robust international response to the escalating situation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> In addition, Biden decided to provide massive security and economic assistance, and unprecedented intelligence support, to Ukraine in order to help its military forces and protect its government.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/brookings-institute" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/two-cheers-for-bidens-national-security-record/" target="_blank">Brookings Institution</a></div><div>*(Think Tank / Policy Group)*</div><div></div></div>| We take that decision for granted, but it remains enormously important, given the potential for escalation in any direct fight between nuclear-armed superpowers that involves a major interest of at least one of them. Biden did, however, help lead a Western response in the economic realm that has cut off most high-tech cooperation between the West and Russia (even if it has not yet substantially reduced Russian oil and gas export earnings or brought the economy to its knees). In addition, Biden decided to provide massive security and economic assistance, and unprecedented intelligence support, to Ukraine in order to help its military forces and protect its government. As of this writing, Ukraine has received some 10,000 precision missiles (mostly Javelin and Stinger) from the United States, some 20 helicopters and a similar number of High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, hundreds of thousands of artillery shells, communications equipment, counter-battery radars, support vehicles all in all, around $15 billion in weapons from the United States alone, as well as considerable intelligence support so that those weapons can be well employed, and lots of cash to keep the economy afloat.|

|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> In the wake of mounting UAV threats, the Ukrainian army ordered hand-held electronic warfare systems to counter drones.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.eurasiantimes.com/snatching-a-drone-ukrainian-forces-seen-using-skywiper-anti-drone/" target="_blank">eurasiantimes.com</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 7th, 2022</div></div>| These guns are designed to neutralize small and medium-sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and can identify and actively disrupt UAV guidance, tracking, and navigation systems. The small size of drones and their ability to move quickly makes it very difficult for kinetic weapons like nets, bullets, and missiles to detect, target, and attack them; therefore, in recent years, weaponized drones are emerging as game-changers on the battlefield, such as in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and the Libyan Civil War. In the wake of mounting UAV threats, the Ukrainian army ordered hand-held electronic warfare systems to counter drones. The contract with NT Service was signed in 2020 through the NATO Support and Supply Agency for 37 SkyWiper EDM4S systems.|

Its also sending hundreds of additional aerial drones for information gathering and logistics support, plus 18 more howitzer artillery guns. "These weapons will help Ukraine defend its skies from attacks and strengthen their overall missile defense alongside the U.S. NASAMS," U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said. The systems, which Kyiv has long wanted, are designed to provide medium- to long-range defense against missile attacks.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> As missiles and rockets continued to strike Ukraine, although in smaller numbers than Monday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that Moscows aerial attacks on civilian targets were "a sign of weakness" and that Ukraine would be better able to deter them if its existing weaponry was expanded.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/japan-times-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/10/12/world/ukraine-g7-air-defense/" target="_blank">The Japan Times</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 12th, 2022</div></div>| NATOs top official on Tuesday called on allies to step up arms supplies to the Ukrainians, especially sophisticated air defense systems, a day after Russia rained rocket fire on 19 cities across Ukraine in a marked escalation of its assault on civilians. As missiles and rockets continued to strike Ukraine, although in smaller numbers than Monday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that Moscows aerial attacks on civilian targets were "a sign of weakness" and that Ukraine would be better able to deter them if its existing weaponry was expanded. "These air defense systems are making a difference because many of the incoming missiles were actually shot down by Ukrainian air defense systems provided by NATO allies," he said.|

In the wake of several days of Russian missile strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been calling for more international assistance in the form of air defense systems. In his nightly address Wednesday, he said "the more audacious and cruel Russian terror becomes, the more obvious it is to the world that helping Ukraine to protect the sky is one of the most important humanitarian tasks for Europe." Power and water supplies are still damaged in a number of regions after Russia targeted critical infrastructure across the country in strikes on Monday and Tuesday and, to a lesser extent, yesterday.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> While Israel is still non-committal on any tangible military assistance to Kyiv, The Times of Israels Hebrew sister publication Zman Yisrael revealed in September that Ukraine was receiving anti-drone technology from a private Israeli defense contractor.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.eurasiantimes.com/israel-steps-in-russia-ukraine-conflict-helping-kyiv-with-intelligence/" target="_blank">eurasiantimes.com</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 15th, 2022</div></div>| Israel possesses some of the best air defense systems in the world, including the Arrow 3, Iron Dome, and the latest and most advanced Iron Beam laser-based missile defense system.
