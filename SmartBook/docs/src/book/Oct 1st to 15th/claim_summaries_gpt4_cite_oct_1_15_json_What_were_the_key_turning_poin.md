The Ukrainian military's advance into Davydiv Brid has created a strategic wedge in Russian-held territories, enhancing Ukraine's prospects of encircling Russian forces and disrupting their logistical operations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Russia's significant air strikes across Ukraine, which have been the largest since the war began, marked a turning point by showing a renewed Russian resolve and targeting civilian areas, including a children's playground in Kyiv <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The Russian military suffered critical setbacks with the loss in the Battle of Kyiv and subsequent forced retreat from northern Ukraine, which led to Ukraine's successful counter-offensives in the east and south <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These military developments, coupled with Russia's portrayal of the conflict as a "Special Military Operation," have been widely recognized internationally as an unjust war of aggression, further deteriorating Russia's position in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The Ukraine-Russia war has seen several key turning points that have shifted the dynamics of the conflict. One such turning point was the significant Ukrainian military advance into Davydiv Brid, which expanded a wedge into Russian-held territory, threatening to encircle Russian forces and disrupt their supply lines on the west bank of the Dnipro River <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This progress was coupled with Russia's biggest airstrikes against Ukraine since the start of the war, which targeted civilian areas and marked a shift in Russian tactics, demonstrating a resolve that was hailed by Moscow hawks but condemned by the West <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Additionally, the Ukrainian threat to Crimea and the destruction of the bridge connecting Russia with the peninsula have been major setbacks for Russian logistics and morale <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Another turning point came with the recognition of the conflict as a war of imperial conquest rather than the "Special Military Operation" Putin had portrayed, especially after Russia's retreat from northern Ukraine following the Battle of Kyiv <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Ukraine's subsequent counter-offensive successes on the eastern and southern fronts further deteriorated Russia's position <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The conflict's escalation was underscored by Putin's controversial mobilization of 300,000 new conscripts, which brought the war home to many Russians and caused widespread concern <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The annexation of four Ukrainian regions by Putin and Ukraine's application for fast-track NATO membership also signaled a shift in the war's geopolitics, potentially indicating a move from great power competition to great power confrontation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

The battle to expand this thumb-like bulge through table-flat farmland and a smattering of small villages raises Ukraines prospects of encircling Russian forces and complicating the movement of supplies and reinforcements. In this area, as elsewhere in Ukraine, the natural barrier of rivers dictate the moves of both armies. The advances around Davydiv Brid allow Ukraine to move shorter-range artillery systems closer to bridges over the Dnipro and piers along its banks.|

Russias battlefield fortunes have continued to deteriorate ever since. Putins army was beaten in the Battle of Kyiv and forced to retreat entirely from northern Ukraine.

|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> The Russian invasion of sovereign Ukraine, along with Chinese military buildup and threats against Taiwan, seem to portend the emergence of a new tripolar world order and a shifting paradigm from great power competition to great power confrontation.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/nuclear-energy-and-global-energy-security-in-the-new-tripolar-world-order/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 12th, 2022</div></div>| The Russian invasion of sovereign Ukraine, along with Chinese military buildup and threats against Taiwan, seem to portend the emergence of a new tripolar world order and a shifting paradigm from great power competition to great power confrontation. And despite the apparent concerns raised by President Xi in his recent meeting with President Putin in Uzbekistan over the war in Ukraine, the meeting confirmed the continuing alliance of these authoritarian states against the United States and NATO.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Already, Russias recent loss of the town Lyman, which its forces used as a logistics hub in Ukraines eastern Donetsk region, would "significantly affect Russias ability to supply, resupply and move its forces all along that forward line of conflict," she said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/defense-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2022/10/03/russian-forces-poised-for-major-defeat-in-kherson-says-dod-official/" target="_blank">Defense News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 3rd, 2022</div></div>| "That would be a major defeat for Russia because it pushes back even more Russias ambition to take Odessa, which was one of the stated objectives earlier this year," Wallander said at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event. "It gives Ukraine another defensive position to ride out what probably will be hot fighting over the winter," Wallander said, adding that in spite of Ukraines recent strategic successes, the U.S. and international community must continue to supply Ukraine with aid. Already, Russias recent loss of the town Lyman, which its forces used as a logistics hub in Ukraines eastern Donetsk region, would "significantly affect Russias ability to supply, resupply and move its forces all along that forward line of conflict," she said.

|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> For many Russians, the war in Ukraine did not begin in February but September, when Putin announced his plans for mass mobilization of soldiers, starting with 300,000 new conscripts as a move to stop Russias losses on the battlefield.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/13/putin-ukraine-escalation-power-war/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 13th, 2022</div></div>| The paramount objective of all autocrats is to stay in power.

For many Russians, the war in Ukraine did not begin in February but September, when Putin announced his plans for mass mobilization of soldiers, starting with 300,000 new conscripts as a move to stop Russias losses on the battlefield. Overnight, the war ignored for months by most Russians suddenly became a personal issue for nearly every family.|
