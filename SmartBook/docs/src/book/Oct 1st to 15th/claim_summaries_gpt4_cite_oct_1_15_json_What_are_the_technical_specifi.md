## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Kamikaze drones like the Shahed-136 are designed as loitering munitions with a payload of approximately 50 kilograms, capable of precision strikes and long-range operations up to 1,250 miles <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These drones are deployed to crash into targets and detonate, a tactic that is hard to detect and allows them to be launched from a distance, currently being used by Russia in its conflict with Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Kamikaze drones, also known as loitering munitions, are designed to hover in potential target areas and strike when an enemy asset is detected <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. With a payload of approximately 50 kilograms, they are equipped to carry precision-guided missiles, offering both portability and ease of launch <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. These drones, specifically the Iranian-made Shahed-136 being employed by Russia in Ukraine, are hard to detect and can operate at a range of around 1,250 miles <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Unlike traditional drones that return to base after releasing their payload, the Shahed-136 is intended to crash into its target and self-destruct, delivering its explosive payload directly upon impact <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Kamikaze drones, such as the Shahed-136 used by Russia in Ukraine, are a form of loitering munition that can wait in an area for a potential target before striking <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. These drones have a payload capacity of around 50 kilograms (110 pounds) and can carry precision-guided missiles, making them effective for targeted strikes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The Shahed-136 has an operational range that is debated among analysts, potentially reaching up to 1,200 miles, though it is likely shorter in practice <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. They are small, portable, and can be easily launched, offering a tactical advantage due to their low detectability and the capability to be fired from a distance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The use of these drones presents a significant challenge for defense systems due to their size, operational altitude, and flight trajectory, which make them difficult to detect and track <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The Shahed-136, also known as the Geran-2 in its Russian variant, is designed to minimize its radar and infrared signatures, further complicating engagement with traditional air defense systems like MANPADS <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. These drones are intentionally designed to destroy themselves upon impact with their target, a feature that differentiates them from traditional military drones that return to base after releasing their payload <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Russian forces have deployed these Iranian-made drones in their conflict with Ukraine, adding a new dimension to the battlefield and prompting a response from NATO allies to supply Ukraine with air defense systems <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

The Russian Embassy in China released a Weibo post in August, citing a retired Russian Army General, Yuri Baluyevsky, praising DJI drones and their capabilities. "The Mavic quadcopter drone made by Chinas DJI has become a true symbol of modern warfare," said Baluyevsky, formerly the Chief of the General Staff of the armed forces of the Russian Federation.

|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> The drone, which has earned the nickname "kamikaze" for destroying its target by physically crashing into it, can be equipped with a small warhead, making it an effective precision weapon, said Christopher Tuck, an expert in conflict and security at Kings College London.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-iranian-kamikaze-drones-ukraine-rcna50977" target="_blank">NBC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| But the drones wingtip and overall shape match those seen in videos available from Iranian military exercises, said Michael A. Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst, and head of intelligence at Le Beck consultancy. "Thats no conclusive proof, but its as close as we can get from an open-source point of view," he said. The drone, which has earned the nickname "kamikaze" for destroying its target by physically crashing into it, can be equipped with a small warhead, making it an effective precision weapon, said Christopher Tuck, an expert in conflict and security at Kings College London.

|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> The threshold at which Mr. Putin would resort to nuclear weapons or how he would use them is far from clear.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/09/world/russia-ukraine-war-news" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Oct 9th, 2022</div></div>| After a series of humiliating retreats, astoundingly high casualty rates and a deeply unpopular move to draft young Russian men into service, Mr. Putin clearly sees the threat of his nuclear arsenal as a way to instill fear and perhaps to recover some respect for Russias power. For months, computer simulations from the Pentagon, American nuclear labs and intelligence agencies have been trying to model what might happen and how the United States could respond. The threshold at which Mr. Putin would resort to nuclear weapons or how he would use them is far from clear. The primary utility of a tactical nuclear strike, many U.S. officials say, would be as part of a last-ditch effort by Mr. Putin to halt the Ukrainian counteroffensive by threatening to make parts of the country uninhabitable.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> The difficulty is compound when drones are shaped to deflect radar waves instead of reflecting them, as with the Geran-2, the Russian variant of the Iranian Shahed-136.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.eurasiantimes.com/battle-of-uavs-russia-or-ukraine-who-is-winning-the-drone-war/" target="_blank">eurasiantimes.com</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 12th, 2022</div></div>| Battlefield drones vary extensively in size, operating altitude, and flight trajectory posing challenges in devising a standard way of detection, tracking, and engagement. Being small and slow-moving makes them very difficult to detect and track. The difficulty is compound when drones are shaped to deflect radar waves instead of reflecting them, as with the Geran-2, the Russian variant of the Iranian Shahed-136. Such drones IR & Radar signature is minimal, precluding engagement with MANPADS.|
