The Kremlin-backed authorities in occupied areas of eastern and southern Ukraine, including Donetsk and Luhansk, have announced they will hold referendums on formally joining Russia, which could lead to the Russian annexation of these areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This move threatens to escalate the ongoing conflict, as Moscow could frame the Ukrainian counteroffensive there as an attack on Russia itself, providing a pretext for a more robust military response <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The results of these referendums, which are considered illegal under international law, are expected to overwhelmingly support joining Russia, leading to a swift annexation similar to the 2014 annexation of Crimea <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The geopolitical implications of this move are significant. The annexation of Donetsk and Luhansk could potentially result in a land grab of approximately 35,000 sq. km, redefining the territorial boundaries of Russia and Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This move could also set a precedent for the annexation of other territories under Russian control, further escalating tensions between Russia and the West <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. In response to these developments, the United States and the European Union are preparing a new package of sanctions on Russia, potentially targeting individuals and implementing trade restrictions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.
