The expected referendums, which run counter to international law upholding Ukraines sovereignty, have been announced as world leaders have descended on New York for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, where the war and it impacts were already poised to loom large.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Russia does not fully control any of the four regions, with only about 60 percent of the Donetsk region in Russian hands.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/20/russia-unfolds-annexation-plan-for-ukraine" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 20th, 2022</div></div>| The self-styled Donetsk Peoples Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk Peoples Republic (LPR), which President Vladimir Putin recognised as independent states just before the invasion on February 24, have said they want referendums on joining Russia from September 23 to 27. The Kherson and Zaporizhia regions, which are yet to be recognised as independent states by Russia, have also said they will hold their own votes.

The decision amounts to a land grab of approximately 35,000 sq.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Ukrainian Regions Where Referendums Are Taking Place Kremlin-backed officials in four partly occupied regions of southern and eastern Ukraine are staging referendums on joining Russia.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/23/world/russia-ukraine-putin-news" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Sep 23rd, 2022</div></div>| The aim of the hastily called referendums supported by pro-Russian residents and their proxies was apparent: to give President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a legally bogus pretext to gobble up their country. And they brought back memories of staged votes in 2014 in Crimea that were swiftly followed by Russias annexation of the peninsula. Ukrainian Regions Where Referendums Are Taking Place Kremlin-backed officials in four partly occupied regions of southern and eastern Ukraine are staging referendums on joining Russia. The voting is widely seen as a sham by Western officials.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> "These are not just crimes against international law and Ukrainian law, these are crimes against specific people, against a nation," Zelenskiy said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-marches-farther-into-liberated-lands-separatist-calls-urgent-referendum-2022-09-19/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 19th, 2022</div></div>| Ukrainian officials said people were banned from leaving some occupied areas until the four-day vote was over, armed groups were going into homes, and employees were threatened with the sack if they did not participate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a nightly address that the votes would be "unequivocally condemned" by the world, along with the mobilisation Russia began this week, including in Crimea and other areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia. "These are not just crimes against international law and Ukrainian law, these are crimes against specific people, against a nation," Zelenskiy said. The votes on becoming part of Russia were hastily-organised after Ukraine recaptured large swathes of the northeast in a counter-offensive earlier this month.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014 in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that make up the key industrial area of Donbas, and Russias recognition of the self-styled peoples republics there preceded its full-scale invasion of the country in February.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/separatists-in-ukraine-luhansk-region-to-hold-referendum-on-joining-russia/" target="_blank">politico.eu</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 20th, 2022</div></div>| In a post on Telegram, Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-appointed head of Kherson, said he hoped the region would become "a part of Russia, a fully fledged subject of a united country," Reuters reported. The Russian-controlled part of Ukraines Zaporizhzhia region may stage a referendum to join Russia in the coming days, Reuters reported, citing the RIA Novosti news agency. Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014 in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that make up the key industrial area of Donbas, and Russias recognition of the self-styled peoples republics there preceded its full-scale invasion of the country in February. Donbas then became the main target of Russias creeping offensive after Moscows failure to seize control of Ukraines capital Kyiv at the start of the war.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> In response to Moscows recognition of the sham referendums, a new raft of EU punitive measures could likely entail more listings of individuals involved in the organisation and execution of the referenda; an EU official told EURACTIV.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/eu-mulls-further-sanctions-if-russias-referendum-plans-in-parts-of-ukraine-materialise/" target="_blank">euractiv.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 21st, 2022</div></div>| Trigger for more sanctions? Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the EU has agreed on six-plus packages of sanctions that include asset freezes and visa bans on Russian oligarchs and officials, export controls, freezing central bank assets, disconnecting banks from the SWIFT messaging system and a ban on imports of Russian coal and oil. In response to Moscows recognition of the sham referendums, a new raft of EU punitive measures could likely entail more listings of individuals involved in the organisation and execution of the referenda; an EU official told EURACTIV. Measures could include similar steps as were implemented already prior to Russias invasion in February, namely sanctioning local officials and banning trade, tourism and financing to annexed regions.|

Some context: Authorities in Kyiv and other Western countries say that the referendums are a "sham" whose outcome has been preordained, and which are carried out often literally at the barrel of a gun.
