The leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines discovered earlier this week could lead to significant environmental and climate damage, with potential methane emissions equivalent to 7.5 million tonnes of CO2 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This damage could be a result of deliberate acts of sabotage, posing risks to shipping and the environment <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The leaks have caused methane, a key driver of global warming, to bubble up to the sea surface, indicating a strong upward flow <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Efforts are underway to investigate the origin of the damage and mitigate potential environmental impacts, with European support, and the energy impact has been somewhat lessened due to the pipelines not being operational at the time of the leaks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The leaking methane from the damaged Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines is anticipated to cause significant climate damage, as per Germany's Federal Environment Agency (UBA). The agency's calculations suggest that the leaks discovered earlier this week could result in methane emissions with a climate-damaging effect equivalent to 7.5 million tonnes of CO2 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Natural gas, which comprises up to 90% methane, is a key driver of global warming, posing a severe risk to humanity and the planet <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The leaks are also creating risks to shipping and causing substantial environmental damage, and investigations are underway to determine the cause <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The effects of these leaks are still coming into focus but are expected to be significant <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In response to this environmental crisis, Western countries and NATO are supporting European efforts to investigate and mitigate the potential environmental impact <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Authorities are keeping ships away from the affected area due to the risk of leaked gas igniting over the water <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, the US and the EU launched a global methane pledge at the COP26 climate talks, aiming to reduce methane emissions by nearly a third by 2030 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The European Commission is also proposing measures to mitigate the crisis, including a revenue cap for cheap electricity production and a levy on extraordinary profits made by fossil energy companies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This incident has released roughly the equivalent of 10% of Germany's annual methane emissions, marking a significant setback for climate change mitigation efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Leaking methane from the damaged Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines is likely to lead to "significant climate damage", Germany's Federal Environment Agency (UBA) has said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/nord-stream-gas-pipeline-leaks-lead-significant-climate-damage-environment-agency" target="_blank">cleanenergywire.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| Leaking methane from the damaged Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines is likely to lead to "significant climate damage", Germany's Federal Environment Agency (UBA) has said. According to calculations by the agency, the leaks in the pipelines connecting Russia with Germany that were found earlier this week might lead to methane emissions with a climate damaging effect equivalent to 7.5 million tonnes of CO2.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> These leaks are causing risks to shipping and substantial environmental damage.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_207733.htm" target="_blank">nato.int</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The damage to the Nordstream 1 and Nordstream 2 pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea is of deep concern. All currently available information indicates that this is the result of deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage. These leaks are causing risks to shipping and substantial environmental damage. We support the investigations underway to determine the origin of the damage.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> So, if you're worried about climate change, what just happened to the Nord Stream pipelines is as close to the apocalypse as we have ever come.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fox-news-editorial-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Right" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-what-happened-nord-stream-pipeline" target="_blank">Fox News (Opinion)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Natural gas is comprised of up to 90% methane. Methane, as Joe Biden has often told you, is the key driver of global warming, which is, of course, an existential threat to humanity and the planet. So, if you're worried about climate change, what just happened to the Nord Stream pipelines is as close to the apocalypse as we have ever come. So, the question is, how did this happen?|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> And so, of course, the impacts on Europes broader energy security and energy resilience will therefore be mitigated.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-september-28-2022/" target="_blank">state.gov</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| We are supporting European efforts to investigate this, and were also we also stand ready to support European efforts to mitigate any potential environmental impact. As you know, the energy impact of this apparent sabotage is and was mitigated by the fact that neither Nord Stream 2, which of course was never operational, and Nord Stream 1, because the Russians had already weaponized Nord Stream 1 by essentially turning it off neither of these pipelines were pumping gas into Europe at the time. And so, of course, the impacts on Europes broader energy security and energy resilience will therefore be mitigated. QUESTION: Well, in the short term.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> The effects of the leaks are still coming into focus, Balcombe said, but are likely to be significant.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/29/nord-stream-pipeline-leaks-are-catastrophic-for-the-climate" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| The pipelines recently burst in several locations in the exclusive economic zones of Denmark and Sweden while neither was in operation during the energy standoff between Russia and Europe. Methane bubbling at the oceans surface was an indication of "a strong upward flow", according to Paul Balcombe, a member of the engineering faculty at the department of chemical engineering at Imperial College London. The effects of the leaks are still coming into focus, Balcombe said, but are likely to be significant. "It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed even if it released a fraction of this."|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Authorities are keeping ships away from the area, citing the risk of leaked gas igniting over the water and in the air but say there are few other security risks, since the leak will only affect the environment where the gas plumes are located.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/energy/nord-stream-pipelines-leaks-explainer-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| Other Western countries and NATO have echoed that conclusion. German, Danish and Scandinavian security authorities are now examining the leaks and trying to identify their cause, according to the German Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who added that Europe is able to protect its own critical infrastructure. Authorities are keeping ships away from the area, citing the risk of leaked gas igniting over the water and in the air but say there are few other security risks, since the leak will only affect the environment where the gas plumes are located.

|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> There are also significant methane emissions from Russian coal mines.Ahead of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, the US and the EU launched a global methane pledge that aims to reduce methane emissions nearly a third by 2030.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-russia/" target="_blank">carbonbrief.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 22nd, 2022</div></div>| According to the IEAs global methane tracker, Russia is the second biggest source of global energy-related methane emissions. The countrys gas infrastructure, including production facilities and pipelines, is notoriously leaky despite calls for the government to take action. There are also significant methane emissions from Russian coal mines.Ahead of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, the US and the EU launched a global methane pledge that aims to reduce methane emissions nearly a third by 2030. Nine of the worlds top 20 emitters have signed onto the effort.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Think tanks like RAP also suggested some measures to tackle the crisis, including a shock absorber that would lower prices without disrupting the functioning of the electricity market.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/the-green-brief-energy-price-cap-whack-a-mole/" target="_blank">euractiv.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| Very aware of this, the European Commission veered away from proposing price caps and, instead, suggested a revenue cap for cheap electricity production and a levy on extraordinary profits made by fossil energy companies. This would enable EU countries to use revenues to shield vulnerable consumers through national-level support schemes. Think tanks like RAP also suggested some measures to tackle the crisis, including a shock absorber that would lower prices without disrupting the functioning of the electricity market. Energy ministers will discuss the Commission proposal at their meeting on Friday and some are still pushing the Commission to introduce an EU-wide cap on gas prices.|
