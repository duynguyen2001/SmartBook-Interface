|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The International Atomic Energy Agency said the shelling had temporarily forced reactor number six "to rely on emergency diesel generators for the power it needs for essential safety functions."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-21-22/h_ea3f873a96167b27be8629c05f9d41f6" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 21st, 2022</div></div>| A number of cables providing electricity to one of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant's reactors were damaged by shelling on Wednesday, the UN nuclear watchdog said in a statement. The International Atomic Energy Agency said the shelling had temporarily forced reactor number six "to rely on emergency diesel generators for the power it needs for essential safety functions." The five other reactors were not affected and continued " to receive power directly from the plant's off-site power line that was restored last week," IAEA added.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> All six of its reactors are in a state of cold shutdown, but the plant needs external power to cool its reactors and defend against the risk of a meltdown.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62943902" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The UN's nuclear watchdog (IAEA) says Ukraine's huge Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has begun receiving power from the national grid once again. Shelling in the area damaged power lines connected to the plant. All six of its reactors are in a state of cold shutdown, but the plant needs external power to cool its reactors and defend against the risk of a meltdown. The IAEA says the situation of the plant, which is held by Russian forces, has improved but remains precarious.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> In late August, for the first time since the plant started operations in 1985, because of hostilities and Russias shelling, the NPP was disconnected from the grid.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/why-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-mattersfor-whole-world" target="_blank">wilsoncenter.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Three were damaged earlier and do not operate now, and two others were under attack a few times, leaving the station cut off. If NPP works in autonomous mode, powering itself with nuclear unit operation or using autonomous diesel generators, under conditions when maintenance cannot be done in a proper manner and without access from the Ukrainian side, the risk of a nuclear disaster, like at Fukushima in 2011, is very high. In late August, for the first time since the plant started operations in 1985, because of hostilities and Russias shelling, the NPP was disconnected from the grid. This happened again on September 5.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> External power sources have been repeatedly knocked out, endangering the system that cools the nuclear reactors and raising the specter of a meltdown.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/first-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/15/1123304625/how-freaked-out-should-we-be-about-ukraines-nuclear-plant" target="_blank">Up First</a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Sep 15th, 2022</div></div>| This huge nuclear complex has been held by Russian forces since March, while the plant itself is being run by an increasingly ragged and exhausted Ukrainian workforce. There have been reports of those workers being mistreated and abused, even as shells have been falling on the complex itself. External power sources have been repeatedly knocked out, endangering the system that cools the nuclear reactors and raising the specter of a meltdown.

|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Zaporizhzia, located in southeastern Ukraine, is Europe's largest power plant, and has six reactors that are currently in a "cold shutdown state," the IAEA said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/19/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 19th, 2022</div></div>| Ukrainian authorities reportedly called the shelling an act of "nuclear terrorism" by Russia. The IAEA also said its experts discovered that a power line used to supply electricity to another nuclear plant, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, had been disconnected Sunday. Zaporizhzia, located in southeastern Ukraine, is Europe's largest power plant, and has six reactors that are currently in a "cold shutdown state," the IAEA said. The plant still receives the electricity it needs for essential safety functions, but it now does not have access to back-up power from the Ukrainian grid, the IAEA experts said.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Further underlining the need for such a zone, there has been renewed shelling at the ZNPP site this week, damaging electrical cables and temporarily forcing one of the six reactor units to rely on emergency diesel generators.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/iaea-proposal-for-ukraine-nuclear-safety-and-security-protection-zone-wins-support-as-talks-begin-on-its-establishment" target="_blank">iaea.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The Director General led an IAEA team of safety, security and safeguards experts to the ZNPP three weeks ago. Two ISAMZ members remain there, providing independent, technical observations and assessments and helping to stabilize the situation. Further underlining the need for such a zone, there has been renewed shelling at the ZNPP site this week, damaging electrical cables and temporarily forcing one of the six reactor units to rely on emergency diesel generators.

|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> These incidents caused no major damage, but underscored potential nuclear safety risks at the facility, the agency said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Animals-likely-triggered-landmines-at-Zaporizhzia" target="_blank">world-nuclear-news.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The IAEA said that in the early morning of 28 September, a landmine exploded about 50 metres outside the perimeter fence of the plant, which is currently controlled by Russian forces. It came after two blasts occurred the previous morning near a channel that carries water from a reservoir to the plant for its cooling system, which the IAEA noted broke some windows in the turbine hall of unit 2. These incidents caused no major damage, but underscored potential nuclear safety risks at the facility, the agency said. Based on investigations by plant staff, the IAEA said it "learnt at the site" these were landmines and had probably been triggered by animals.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The plant and the area around it, including the nearby city of Enerhodar, endured persistent shelling that has raised fears of a nuclear accident.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-17-22/h_aa65b48532723ac938de1b1c49d4bcb6" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 17th, 2022</div></div>| On Friday, Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said it delivered urgently needed parts to "repair the damaged power lines as well as additional fuel supplies for the plant's emergency diesel generators that can be used as a back-up power source." Some background: Grossi called for a safety zone around the nuclear plant after he and his team visited the Russian-held site earlier this month. The plant and the area around it, including the nearby city of Enerhodar, endured persistent shelling that has raised fears of a nuclear accident. Each side accuses the other of acts of nuclear terrorism, and CNN has been unable to verify either government's claims.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Ukrainian energy operator Energoatom said Russian shelling again damaged infrastructure at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and briefly forced workers to start two diesel generators for emergency power to reactor cooling pumps.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-mail" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Right" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11234849/Russians-race-flee-country-flights-sell-terrified-civilians-dreading-military-call-up.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 21st, 2022</div></div>| If approved, as expected, by the upper house and then signed by Putin, the legislation would strengthen commanders' hands against failing morale reported among soldiers. In the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar, shelling continued around Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Ukrainian energy operator Energoatom said Russian shelling again damaged infrastructure at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and briefly forced workers to start two diesel generators for emergency power to reactor cooling pumps. Such pumps are essential for avoiding a meltdown at a nuclear facility even though all six of the plant's reactors have been shut down.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> This year, however, with the rise in geopolitical tensions and the energy crisis after the Russia-Ukraine war, the agendas of environmentalists in developed countries have been set aside in favor of policies which prioritize energy security.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/energy/nuclear/developed-countries-accelerate-nuclear-plans-amid-energy-crisis/36356" target="_blank">aa.com.tr</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Since the leak in the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011, public pressure has increased in many countries over safety precautions for nuclear power plants. Due to raised environmental awareness and climate change along with the transition away from hydrocarbons, some countries have prepared plans to phase out nuclear plants. This year, however, with the rise in geopolitical tensions and the energy crisis after the Russia-Ukraine war, the agendas of environmentalists in developed countries have been set aside in favor of policies which prioritize energy security. In recent months, major economies worldwide have revised plans to revive nuclear energy.|
