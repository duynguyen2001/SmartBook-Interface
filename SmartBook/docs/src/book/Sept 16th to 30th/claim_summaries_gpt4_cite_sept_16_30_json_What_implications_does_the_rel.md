The prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia, which included two American citizens, has been largely appreciated by the United States, as it signifies Ukraine's inclusive approach towards all prisoners of war in its negotiations, irrespective of their nationalities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his gratitude towards Saudi Arabia for spearheading the initiative, emphasizing the importance of the two American citizens being reunited with their families <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The release of the prisoners also involves a significant diplomatic victory for Saudi Arabia, demonstrating the value of the crown prince's alliance with Russia to Western partners who are seeking to isolate Moscow over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>This development raises the stakes in international relations within the context of the Ukraine-Russia crisis, potentially influencing the US stance towards the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. It is worth noting that the American government has warned Russia of devastating consequences, should the conflict escalate to the use of nuclear weapons, emphasizing that the US would respond decisively in such an event <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the release of the American prisoners, as part of a broader prisoner swap that involved several high-profile individuals, may boost morale and demonstrate the commitment of the involved nations to negotiate and resolve the crisis diplomatically, which could be seen as a positive aspect in the US's perspective on the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may also find that the initiative -- intentionally or otherwise -- helps take him a step nearer international rehabilitation after the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi damaged his reputation, they say. With Prince Mohammed's mediation, Russia on Wednesday released 10 foreigners it had captured in Ukraine, including five Britons and two Americans. The move, apparently made possible by Prince Mohammed's carefully nurtured ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, coincided with a prisoner exchange involving 215 Ukrainians and 55 Russians and pro-Moscow Ukrainians that Turkey helped broker.|

If the US truly believes Russia will risk a nuclear war over a defeat in Ukraine, the only way to reduce the risk is to avoid a Russian defeat. At the same time, the US cannot accept a Ukrainian defeat because of the catastrophic consequences this would have for both European security as well as NATO credibility. The only alternative left to them is a stalemate in which Putin can claim a "victory".|

Though Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu has said that only those with prior military experience are eligible to be drafted, some ordinary Russians fear that there could be broader conscription on the horizon, potentially creating consequences for Mr. Putin at home. "Mobilization raises the stakes not only in war, and not only in international relations, it raises the stakes in domestic politics," Ivan Kurilla, a professor of history and international relations at the European University in St. Petersburg, wrote on Facebook. However, Greg Yudin, a professor of political philosophy at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences currently at Princeton University, said while the "partial" mobilization order did not set limits to the draft, it was still "not a breach of the famous you dont mess up with our business, we dont mess up with yours contract either."|

The deal served U.S. interests by ensuring that Iran doesnt develop a nuclear bomb, through a mutual accord rather than through war. By contrast, Saudi Arabias failure to advance any U.S. interests, such as contributing to easing the global pressure on energy prices, normalizing relations with Israel, or joining the West in efforts to defeat Vladimir Putins aggression in Ukraine, is met with demands to double down on groveling to its capricious rulers in vain hopes that such gestures would somehow be reciprocated. Saudi Arabia may be an extreme case of the hawks double standards and inconsistencies, but by no means the only one.|
