<template v-slot:less-detailed>
There has been a significant surge in the number of Russians entering Finland, particularly after the Russian Federation's announcement of military mobilisation, with many Russians in transit to other countries rather than entering for tourism purposes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The Finnish Border Guard noted a 38% increase in traffic at border crossing points since Russia lifted its COVID-19 restrictions, indicating that the increase is not solely due to tourism <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The number of Russians entering Finland has significantly increased, particularly following the Russian Federation's military call-up announcement <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The surge in arrivals is largely due to attempts to avoid military conscription in Russia, with many of these individuals transiting through Finland to other destinations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This increase in border crossings has been facilitated by the lifting of COVID-19 travel restrictions earlier in the year <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. However, the Finnish authorities have since tightened visa rules for Russian tourists, which may impact future figures <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The number of Russian citizens entering Finland has significantly increased following the announcement of mobilization in Russia, with the majority of them en route to vacation destinations in other parts of Europe <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Finnish border guard data shows that traffic at border crossing points has increased by 38 per cent since July 15, when Russia lifted its COVID-19 restrictions at the joint border crossing with Finland, and the number of Russians who entered Finland via its land border on Sunday was double that of the previous Sunday <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>However, not all Russians are coming for tourism or leisure. Following the call-up of 300,000 reservists by the Kremlin for the ongoing war against Ukraine, hundreds of thousands have fled to neighboring countries to avoid military conscription, with a record number entering Finland via its land border <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Even though Finland has tightened the rules for Russians applying for tourist visas and cut the number of tourist visas issued to Russians by 90 percent since early September, the number of Russians entering Finland is still high <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

The number of border crossings has significantly increased in Finland following the announced mobilisation in the Russian Federation. On 19 September, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland started to implement entry restrictions for Russian citizens travelling solely for the purpose of tourism or leisure. Similar restrictions are under way in Finland.|

Since that time, hundreds of thousandshave fledto neighboring countries in a desperate bid to avoid military conscription. Last weekend saw a record number of Russians entering neighboring Finland via its land border since the Kremlin's announcement, with 16,886 Russians arriving in total over Saturday and Sunday, according to the border guard's head of international affairs, Matti Pitkaniitty. Of that number, many were "in transit to other countries," he added.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Since September 1, the Finnish authorities have tightened the rules for Russians applying for tourist visas.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/3-people-suspected-for-trying-to-illegally-cross-border-from-russia-to-finland/" target="_blank">schengenvisainfo.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 21st, 2022</div></div>| Moreover, data provided by the Finnish Border Guard revealed that traffic at border crossing points had increased by 38 per cent since July 15, when Russia lifted its COVID-19 restrictions at the joint border crossing with Finland. Such data also show that 596 people have crossed the border in just one week. Since September 1, the Finnish authorities have tightened the rules for Russians applying for tourist visas. According to the authorities, this means that Finland will only accept about 100 visa applications per day for tourist purposes from citizens of Russia.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Even Finland, which initially accepted thousands of Russian arrivals, has announced it will close its borders.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/foreign-affairs" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russian-federation/europe-disastrous-ban-russians" target="_blank">Foreign Affairs</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| Yet very few Russians have made it to the countries that, in theory, should be most eager and best equipped to accept opponents of Putin: the countries of the European Union. EU states have almost completely shut down entry points from Russia by land and air, and for most Russians, it is nearly impossible to get visas. Even Finland, which initially accepted thousands of Russian arrivals, has announced it will close its borders. These travel restrictions fly directly in the face of Western interests, both in the war in Ukraine and in support for anti-Putin movements in Russia.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Finland cut the number of tourist visas issued to Russians by 90 percent since early September.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/finnish-border-force-wants-hundreds-of-kilometers-of-fence-with-russia/" target="_blank">politico.eu</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 27th, 2022</div></div>| For now, illegal crossings are not a "widespread phenomenon," the Border Guards head of international cooperation Matti Pitkniitty told local reporters. But restrictions on crossing the border, whether from the Russian or from the Finnish side, might change the situation. Finland cut the number of tourist visas issued to Russians by 90 percent since early September. But the fence is unlikely to change anything in the short term the government must still discuss and green-light it, and it will take two to three years to build, Border Guard boss Kostamovaara said.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Including Saturday's numbers,16,886 Russians arrived in total, with "many in transit to other countries," he added.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-26-22/h_2f92261c17bbde1890098c0e17f8c02c" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 26th, 2022</div></div>| The number of Russians who entered Finland via its land border with Russia on Sunday was double that of the previous Sunday, the Finnish border guard said. On Sunday, 8,314 Russians entered Finland via the Finnish-Russian land border double the number than(the)week before,tweeted Matti Pitkniitty,the border guard's head of international affairs. Including Saturday's numbers,16,886 Russians arrived in total, with "many in transit to other countries," he added. Following the Kremlin's announcement of "partial mobilization," Russia saw nationwide protests and an exodus ofcitizens fleeing the country.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Even so, the country has considerably reduced tourist-visa issuance, accepting applications from Russians only once per week.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-eus-russia-visa-ban-debate-reveals-the-blocs-new-power-center/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 23rd, 2022</div></div>| Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland (all of which share a land border with Russia) jointly agreed to stop issuing Schengen visas to Russians for tourism, business, sports, and cultural purposesand on Monday, all four began blocking Russian tourists from entering. This is a big deal, since it means the only land crossing between the EU and Russia that remains open for Russians is Finland (because Helsinki couldnt find justification under the national legislation for banning Russian tourists). Even so, the country has considerably reduced tourist-visa issuance, accepting applications from Russians only once per week. On the other side, most of the western part of the EU, including France and Germany, remains reluctant to take such strong steps.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Last weekend also saw a record number of Russians entering Finland via its land border, with 16,886 Russians arriving in total over Saturday and Sunday, according to the border guard's head of international affairs, Matti Pitkaniitty.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-29-22/h_872f4092953d8cd1824078d482accdce" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| Some context: The announcement comes after Helsinki announced Wednesday it would "significantly" restrict the right of Russian tourists to enter the country or as transit when travelling to other parts of the Schengen area. Finland's border guard also said Wednesday that more than50,000 Russians have entered Finland via the land border since September 21. Last weekend also saw a record number of Russians entering Finland via its land border, with 16,886 Russians arriving in total over Saturday and Sunday, according to the border guard's head of international affairs, Matti Pitkaniitty.|
