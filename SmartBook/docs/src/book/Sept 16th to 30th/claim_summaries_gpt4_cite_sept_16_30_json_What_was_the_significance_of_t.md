The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant played a significant role in Ukraine's energy production, providing 23 percent of all electricity in the country and proving crucial during winter coal shortages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. However, the 2022 Russian invasion brought serious disruptions to this key infrastructure, with Russia seizing the 6 GW plant and threatening to stop supplying electricity to Ukraine's energy grid <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The power plant, Europe's largest with six reactors, was forced into a "cold shutdown state," losing access to back-up power from the Ukrainian grid amid the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This situation heightened concerns about potential radiation leaks, as shelling disrupted power supply, forcing one reactor to rely on emergency diesel generators for essential safety functions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP), Europe's largest single generator, has played a significant role during the 2022 Ukraine-Russia crisis, being a primary source of electricity for the country <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The war has altered energy production and consumption patterns, with the NPPs' role proving vital, particularly when high-capacity utilization helped to overcome winter coal shortages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. However, the Russian invasion has had a significant impact on Ukraine's energy industry, with Russia seizing the 6 GW Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and threatening to cut off electricity supply to Ukraine's energy grid <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In the midst of the crisis, all six reactors of the Zaporizhzhia NPP were put into a state of "cold shutdown" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Despite this, the plant still requires external power for cooling and to prevent a potential meltdown <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Shelling at the plant has caused concerns over a possible radiation leak, leading to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) labeling it an act of "nuclear terrorism" by Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The plant has had to rely on emergency diesel generators for essential safety functions, further emphasizing the precarious situation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Despite the volatile circumstances, the plant's off-site power line was restored, allowing it to continue functioning <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Nevertheless, the potential for a disaster on the scale of Chernobyl remains a concern <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Such a solution, of course, would also imply a compromise on the Russian side, at least concerning the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, where some form of joint civil administration with Kyiv may be required.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/09/war-and-peace-imagining-a-way-from-one-to-the-other-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">thebulletin.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| The idea of a joint Russian-Ukrainian (and not just Western) "Recovery Fund" could serve the task of jointly restoring the infrastructure destroyed in the Donbas and on the already occupied territory of Ukraine. In the first stage of discussion, questions of military security could probably be resolved through the centuries-old practice of creating demilitarized zones on the border between the two countries and, as is already being discussed, around nuclear power plants and other critical infrastructure facilities near the conflict zone. Such a solution, of course, would also imply a compromise on the Russian side, at least concerning the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, where some form of joint civil administration with Kyiv may be required. Other important aspects of this basket can be the neutral status of Ukraine being enshrined in the countrys constitution (with the possibility of participation in the economic structures of the EU) or the case of a broadly agreed revival of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.|
