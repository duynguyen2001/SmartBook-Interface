The ongoing self-styled referendums in the Russian-controlled Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia are seen as a precursor to Russia's annexation of these territories, amounting to roughly 15% of Ukraine's total landmass <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These referendums have been widely criticised and dismissed as "sham" by Ukraine, the West, and numerous political analysts due to reports of locals being intimidated into voting by armed Russian soldiers and the outcomes being predetermined by the Kremlin <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Following the expected landslide "yes" votes, Russia is set to officially annex these regions, which could escalate the ongoing war and cause a significant shift in regional security dynamics <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>With the annexation of these regions, Russia is likely to view any military action by Ukraine against these areas as an attack on Russia itself, possibly leading to a nuclear response from Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This move could potentially challenge the Western views of Ukraine and strengthen Russia's position in the SCO and BRICS, leading to a major geopolitical shift <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The annexation could also provide Russia with a pretext to escalate its currently faltering war efforts, resulting in potential regional instability due to Russia's membership in the Collective Security Treaty Organization <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
