## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The persistent shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has increased the risk of a nuclear accident by damaging cables providing electricity to the reactors, forcing them to rely on emergency generators, and repeatedly knocking out external power sources that endanger the system cooling the nuclear reactors <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Moreover, the potential for a disaster is exacerbated by reports of an exhausted Ukrainian workforce, who have been enduring mistreatment and abuse, and the plant being under control of the Russian forces since March <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, host to six reactors and six GW of installed capacity, is under considerable threat due to its capture by Russian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The persistent shelling has damaged electricity cables to one of the plant's reactors, forcing it to rely on emergency generators for power, while the remaining reactors continue to receive off-site power <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This has raised fears of a potential meltdown, as the shelling has repeatedly knocked out external power sources that are critical to the cooling system of the nuclear reactors <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported instances of explosions near the plant, including one that occurred about 50 meters outside the plant's perimeter <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>The situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has drawn comparisons to the Chernobyl disaster due to the similar structural and organizational challenges <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Shelling has also occurred near other nuclear facilities, including the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, where a blast from shelling occurred about 300 meters away from its industrial site <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The ongoing conflict and the precarious situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have heightened global concerns about the risk of a nuclear disaster, prompting calls for demilitarization and an end to shelling <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. However, the continuance of the conflict has only increased the threat to the nuclear plant, emphasizing the urgent need for peace negotiations and international monitoring of the plant's safety <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

The similarities between Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia are as much organizational as they are structural, says Jonathan Becker, executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs for Bard College.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Ukrainian authorities reportedly called the shelling an act of "nuclear terrorism" by Russia.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/19/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 19th, 2022</div></div>| The blast from the shelling occurred about 300 meters, or 984 feet, from the industrial site of the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant in Mykolaiv Province, the IAEA said in a press release. No staff were injured by the missile, which impacted three power lines that were swiftly reconnected, Ukraine's nuclear operator Energoatom told the IAEA. Ukrainian authorities reportedly called the shelling an act of "nuclear terrorism" by Russia. The IAEA also said its experts discovered that a power line used to supply electricity to another nuclear plant, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, had been disconnected Sunday.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Tension is at its highest point, with the war in Ukraine having raised the credible risk of a global nuclear disaster, as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has shown.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://press.un.org/en/2022/ga12453.doc.htm" target="_blank">press.un.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Csaba Krsi, President of the General Assembly, invited States who remember the unimaginable suffering caused by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 to reflect on viable solutions to put an end to such horrible weapons that have no place in the modern world. He expressed regret that the war in Ukraine and the critical situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have undermined, in a few short months, the declaration made in January by the five nuclear Powers, which affirmed that "a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought" and caused the failure of the tenth Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Tension is at its highest point, with the war in Ukraine having raised the credible risk of a global nuclear disaster, as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has shown. Mr. Guterres and Mr. Krsi presented their ideas for breaking the deadlock and restoring legitimacy to the multilateral non-proliferation regime which is essential for the elimination of nuclear weapons.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> As the fighting rages on, the threat to the biggest nuclear plant in the region has only increased.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/ukrainian-forces-recapture-the-strategic-city-of-izium-in-kharkiv-province/article65894686.ece" target="_blank">frontline.thehindu.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 22nd, 2022</div></div>| The IAEA team chose not to apportion blame for the dangerous game of brinkmanship that is going on around the plant and instead called for an immediate stop to the shelling and the establishment of a demilitarised zone. Russia rejected calls to demilitarise the area around the nuclear plant saying that it would make it more vulnerable. As the fighting rages on, the threat to the biggest nuclear plant in the region has only increased. Mearsheimer pointed out that the statements by US President Joseph Biden and his top officials on the conflict had not helped matters.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> The routinization of war gradually turns the impossible into the ordinary, perpetuates narrow-mindedness, and ultimately postpones peace for months and years.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/09/war-and-peace-imagining-a-way-from-one-to-the-other-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">thebulletin.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| They invite the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor the safety of the nuclear power plant, even though it remains under regular artillery fire that both sides blame on one another. They both have long been accustomed to the fact that one of the oldest NATO members, while supplying game-changing Bayraktar combat drones to Ukraine, offers itself as the most active mediator for peace negotiations and as an important trade partner to Russia. The routinization of war gradually turns the impossible into the ordinary, perpetuates narrow-mindedness, and ultimately postpones peace for months and years. So perhaps it is fair to put forward the following as a description of the current state of affairs: "The longer the war continues, the further the prospect of peace."|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> These incidents caused no major damage, but underscored potential nuclear safety risks at the facility, the agency said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Animals-likely-triggered-landmines-at-Zaporizhzia" target="_blank">world-nuclear-news.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The IAEA said that in the early morning of 28 September, a landmine exploded about 50 metres outside the perimeter fence of the plant, which is currently controlled by Russian forces. It came after two blasts occurred the previous morning near a channel that carries water from a reservoir to the plant for its cooling system, which the IAEA noted broke some windows in the turbine hall of unit 2. These incidents caused no major damage, but underscored potential nuclear safety risks at the facility, the agency said. Based on investigations by plant staff, the IAEA said it "learnt at the site" these were landmines and had probably been triggered by animals.|
