The G7's 'coordination mechanism' has been established to support Ukraine in repairing, restoring, and defending its critical energy and water infrastructure, a response to the damaging attacks by Russia on civilian facilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This mechanism is intended to act as a single-entry point for actions on Ukraine's reconstruction, coordinating priorities, financing, and monitoring of progress with various international partners and financial institutions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Despite the challenges posed by high electricity prices in Europe, which complicate efforts for Ukraine to secure foreign energy imports <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>, the G7's coordination is a key factor in Ukraine's momentum in the war, reinforcing its battlefield capabilities and weakening Russia's military efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the success of Ukraine's infrastructure repair efforts is heavily reliant on donations of equipment, with institutions like the Energy Community Secretariat playing a vital role in attracting and coordinating such support <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.
