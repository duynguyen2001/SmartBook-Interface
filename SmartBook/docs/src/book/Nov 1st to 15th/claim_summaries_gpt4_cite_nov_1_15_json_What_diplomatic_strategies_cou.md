The United States, while not seen as an honest broker due to its active involvement in the conflict, maintains open communication with the Kremlin and discourages escalation through deterrent measures <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The Biden administration emphasizes its role as a supportive partner rather than pressuring Ukraine, backing this with tangible military assistance and emphasizing the importance of strategic messaging to uphold international support <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. To counter the narrative that Ukraine is refusing talks, the U.S. acknowledges Ukraine's willingness for diplomacy in spite of the ongoing aggression and the lack of Russian openness to negotiations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Additionally, the U.S. is laying the groundwork for crisis diplomacy to manage the risks of escalation, including the potential use of nuclear weapons <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The United States is facing the challenge of countering the Kremlin's narrative that Ukraine is refusing to engage in talks, while simultaneously supporting Ukraine's position and sovereignty. To navigate this situation, U.S. officials have not been pushing Ukraine to the negotiating table, recognizing that Russia has not shown a willingness to negotiate in good faith, and instead are focusing on advising Ukraine to adjust its messaging strategy to maintain international support <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. At the same time, the Biden administration is maintaining open channels with the Kremlin, warning against escalation and outlining deterrent measures, though there is an acknowledgment that urging diplomacy is complex given the U.S.'s active role in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>Quiet diplomacy, including the laying of groundwork for crisis diplomacy, is one strategy the U.S. is considering to improve the chances of preventing further escalation, particularly in light of the threat of nuclear weapon use by Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Additionally, high-level discussions, such as National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's meeting with President Zelensky, have involved urging Ukraine not to categorically rule out talks with Putin, as this could reinforce the Kremlin's narrative and potentially impact Ukraine's international support <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. While ensuring Ukraine's autonomy in decision-making, U.S. officials like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Milley, have publicly stated that opportunities for negotiation and peace should be seized when they arise, emphasizing that the U.S. is not dictating terms to Ukraine but is ready to support the country in its diplomatic efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

Of course, Washington should keep open channels of communication with the Kremlin. But other than warning the Russians not to escalate and outlining various deterrent measures, what can the Biden administration do without going behind the backs of the Ukrainians? The challenge of urging diplomacy at this moment can be readily seen in this weeks kerfuffle involving the Progressive Caucus.|

|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Rather, the US more immediate goal has just been to try to get the Ukrainians to change their messaging strategy, the sources added, so that the country can maintain its international coalition of financial and military support for as long as necessary.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/us-ukraine-diplomacy/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 7th, 2022</div></div>| Zelensky has said repeatedly over the last eight months of war that Ukraine is willing to engage in diplomatic talks with the Russians, and the US understands why he would not want to sit down with the man who is bombing his country daily. US officials have therefore not been trying to push Ukraine to the negotiating table, the sources said, especially because it is clear that Russia has not shown any willingness to negotiate, either. Rather, the US more immediate goal has just been to try to get the Ukrainians to change their messaging strategy, the sources added, so that the country can maintain its international coalition of financial and military support for as long as necessary. "The United States is going to be with Ukraine for as long as it takes in this fight," Sullivan said in Kyiv last week.|

For understandable reasons, Washington wants to maintain strategic ambiguity in public while communicating its views to the Kremlin in private. "However, attempts to use a combination of new sanctions, more diplomatic isolation and possibly conventional NATO strikes against Russian military targets in Ukraine to deter a desperate Putin from using weapons of mass destruction, should he feel cornered, are by no means guaranteed to succeed. To improve the chances of preventing a showdown, the quiet groundwork for crisis diplomacy should be laid now."|
