<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Despite concerns that Iran's provision of drones and potential delivery of ballistic missiles to Russia could impact the war dynamics, analysts believe these actions are unlikely to change the West's support for Ukraine or the overall outcome of the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, Iran's increasing involvement may prompt Western nations to pay closer attention to Middle Eastern affairs, potentially affecting the strategic calculus of NATO and its member states <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Iran's decision to supply Russia with drones and potentially missiles and military advisors underscores its strategic alignment with Moscow, and may lead to Iran receiving advanced military hardware such as fighter aircraft or the S-400 air defense system in return <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This support for Russia's war in Ukraine could ironically increase Western attention to the Middle East, contrary to Tehran's hopes of diverting U.S. focus from the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Despite the provision of materiel, analysts suggest that drones and other Iranian support are unlikely to be a game-changer in the conflict, as Russia's fundamental military shortcomings, particularly in troops, persist <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, if Iran were to supply Russia with ballistic missiles, this could represent a more significant escalation and potentially affect NATO's strategic calculus regarding support for Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Iran's potential provision of drones, missiles, and military advisors to Russia is seen as strategically sensible for Tehran and demonstrates its value to the anti-Western alliance, with analysts suggesting that Iran might benefit in return through acquiring advanced Russian military equipment such as fighter aircraft or the S-400 air defense system <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This support could ironically lead to increased Western attention to the Middle East, contrary to Iranâ€™s intention to divert the US focus from the region. Consequently, it is recommended that Washington should ensure that its regional allies are well-equipped to counter Iran's aggression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Furthermore, NATO has condemned Iran's potential coordination with Russia, particularly in supplying drones and the possibility of ballistic missiles, which indicates a serious concern within the alliance regarding Iran's involvement in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The increased Iranian support for Russia, especially if it includes the supply of ballistic missiles, could significantly escalate the conflict and alter the strategic situation on the ground <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. While the current military aid from Iran is not expected to change the war's momentum according to some analysts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>, the possibility of more advanced weapons transfers has triggered the West to consider bolstering Ukraine's air-defense capabilities urgently <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. This suggests that Iran's deepening involvement on the side of Russia is likely to affect the strategic calculus of NATO and its member states, potentially leading to a recalibration of the support provided to Ukraine to counter the enhanced threats posed by Iranian-supplied weaponry <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> While by fuelling the crisis in Ukraine, Iran likely hopes to lead the US to continue diverting its attention from the Middle East, "ironically, Tehrans support for Russias war in Ukraine could prompt the West to pay more, not less, attention to the Middle East, especially if Europe now embraces a tougher line toward Iran", note the analysts.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.intellinews.com/iran-for-first-time-involved-in-major-war-on-european-continent-conclude-analysts-261206/?source=iran" target="_blank">intellinews.com</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| "Viewed in this context, a deal to supply Russia with drones, missiles, and military advisors makes strategic sense for Iran and can demonstrate the latters value to one of its two senior partners in the anti-Western entente," add Hardie and Taleblu. Turning to the question of what, militarily, Iran may receive in return, the analysts suggest advanced Russian fighter aircraft or the S-400 air defence system, which Moscow has previously declined to sell to Tehran, could now be offered. While by fuelling the crisis in Ukraine, Iran likely hopes to lead the US to continue diverting its attention from the Middle East, "ironically, Tehrans support for Russias war in Ukraine could prompt the West to pay more, not less, attention to the Middle East, especially if Europe now embraces a tougher line toward Iran", note the analysts. Washington, they conclude, should work to ensure its Israeli and Arab allies, "who have for years lived on the front lines of the Iranian drone and missile threat, have the military capabilities and support they need to counter Irans aggression".|

While the moral and ethical imperatives of humanitarian assistance certainly apply in the present case, they are also joined by an ominous political calculus. Refugee fatigue is an opportunity for Russia to sow division between European countries and undermine Western support for Ukraine. With a challenging winter season now fast approaching, the democratic world would do well to find a renewed and expanded commitment toward refugee admittance and resettlement.|

However, they could still be deadly for Ukrainians, he said. "And it's certainly not going to change our calculus ... or with so many of our allies and partners about the kinds of capabilities we're going to continue to provide the Ukrainians," he said. Kirby said the North Korean shipments were a sign not only of Pyongyang's willingness to support Russia but of Moscow's munitions shortages brought on by U.S.-led sanctions and export controls.|

"Russia needs troops on the ground who are trained and capable and it simply doesn't have that despite mobilization." But if Iran sends ballistic missiles to Russia, that changes the calculus, said Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

In recent weeks, the United States and at least one allied nation have observed indications that Iran is preparing to transfer the weapons, the officials said, although its unclear how close Iran is to sending them.|

"The West must avoid complacency about the need to urgently bolster Ukrainian air-defence capacity," defense and security think tank RUSI said. Moscow and Tehran have denied that there is a deal for Iran to supply Russia a country with limited supply options due to international sanctions with weapons. However, the Iranian government acknowledged for the first time Saturday that it had sent a number of drones to Russia, but insisted this was before Russia invaded Ukraine.|

A turning point came late last month, when Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz took a long-requested call from his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov.|

It will force the Russian public to belatedly confront decades of nationalistic myth-making by their own rapacious elites. It is still far too early to predict what kind of Russia will emerge from the wreckage of Putins Ukraine invasion, but it already looks unlikely that anyone will continue to view the country as one of the worlds superpowers.

|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> The war in Ukraine will likely accelerate that process, and it could even spur Vietnam to buy Western-made weapons on a much faster timeline than it had planned, said Nguyen The Phuong, a scholar of Vietnams military at the University of New South Wales in Australia.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/05/world/ukraine-war-news-russia-updates" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Nov 5th, 2022</div></div>| At the same time, he added, Vietnam appears to be "slowly shifting its orbit from Russian systems to a mix that includes NATO-compliant ones, although this will take decades." Even before the war, Vietnam was trying to diversify its arsenal by manufacturing its own guns and troop carriers and buying small amounts of weapons from India and Israel. The war in Ukraine will likely accelerate that process, and it could even spur Vietnam to buy Western-made weapons on a much faster timeline than it had planned, said Nguyen The Phuong, a scholar of Vietnams military at the University of New South Wales in Australia. "If we want to maintain some kind of deterrence capability toward China, the modernization has to speed up like 10 times faster," he said.|
