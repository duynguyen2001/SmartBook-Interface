# What is the likelihood of Russia expanding its missile campaign to other areas of Ukraine or beyond, and what would be the strategic implications?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The likelihood of Russia expanding its missile campaign to other areas of Ukraine remains high, as evidenced by its recent barrage of "around 100 missiles" targeting Ukrainian cities, reflecting a continuation of efforts to overwhelm Ukraine's defenses and damage critical infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Strategically, such expansions strain Ukrainian resources and necessitate international support, while also imposing significant costs on Russia, considering the expensive nature of missile systems and the potential strategic and psychological impacts of their use or loss <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

The Ukrainian military high command has indicated that Russian forces are fortifying positions in the Kherson region, suggesting a preparation for continued combat operations, which may hint at an expansion of their missile campaign within Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The strategic implications of such expansion are profound, as Russia's missile attacks have already targeted Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, causing significant damage and generating new requirements for Ukrainian air-defense equipment <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite the extensive costs associated with missile expansion, both in acquisition and sustainment, as outlined by the Congressional Budget Office, Russia has demonstrated a willingness to incur these expenses, as evidenced by their continued missile strikes across Ukraine and their development of the new "Satan-2" missile <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Moreover, the recent large-scale missile attack on Ukrainian cities underscores the likelihood of Russia's commitment to employing its missile arsenal to achieve strategic objectives, despite the international ramifications and the strain on its military resources <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The recent increase in missile attacks by Russia on Ukrainian cities suggests that there is a likelihood of further expansion of its missile campaign within Ukraine. On one occasion, Russia fired approximately "around 100 missiles" at various cities across the country, indicating a significant escalation and the largest wave of strikes since a previous increase in attacks on October 10, which targeted Ukraine's electricity, water, and gas infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The systematic nature of these attacks, which appear to be aimed at crippling Ukraine's power system and infrastructure, demonstrates Russia's capability and willingness to conduct extensive missile strikes that could potentially extend to other areas within Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Analysts have also noted the strategic use of missile strikes in attempts to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses, as evidenced by an attack on October 31 where Russia launched 55 missiles, although only 10 penetrated the defenses causing considerable damage to energy structures <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The strategic implications of such an expansion are multifaceted. Russia's missile campaign is already causing major problems for Ukraine, generating new requirements for Ukrainian air-defense equipment, and leading to rationing of power to prevent a collapse of the electricity grid <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The Russian missile strikes are strategically planned with the intent to damage Ukraine's high voltage networks and hinder the provision of heating and electricity to millions of consumers, which is already proving challenging for the Ukrainian transmission system operator, Ukrenergo <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Moreover, the continuous missile attacks and the potential for further escalation raise concerns internationally, prompting discussions within NATO on the level of military assistance provided to Ukraine and the potential for stepped-up arms supplies as a deterrent to Russian aggression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The costs associated with expanding missile capabilities, such as the United States' projected costs for strategic delivery systems, suggest that similar actions by Russia would be very expensive, adding a significant financial dimension to the strategic implications <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

The city is important for gaining access to the Black Sea and Crimea, and also provides a path to Ukraines southern coastline for invading Russian forces. Its loss would deal both a strategic and psychological blow to Russia. In a statement on Tuesday, the Ukrainian military high command said that Russian forces had "set up technical fortifications" and mines or explosives around civilian housing in the Kherson region, most likely to use as defensive positions for a looming battle.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> It is unclear what the costs of similar actions would be for Russia, but they are likely to also be very expensive.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://thebulletin.org/premium/2022-11/nuclear-notebook-the-long-view-strategic-arms-control-after-the-new-start-treaty/" target="_blank">thebulletin.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 27th, 2022</div></div>| Depending on the desired degree of flexibility and the cost of new strategic delivery systems, such an expansion could cost the United States, for instance, between $88 billion to $439 billion in one-time acquisition costs, plus $4 billion to $28 billion in annual operation and sustainment costs (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 3). This does not even include research and development costs or the Department of Energys costs to produce, sustain, or store more nuclear warheads. It is unclear what the costs of similar actions would be for Russia, but they are likely to also be very expensive. Moreover, there are expected consequences beyond the offensive strategic nuclear forces that New START regulates.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Yet, earlier, it had been the Kremlin's intention that the huge new missile would be fully deployed with its forces before the start of 2023.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-mail" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Right" /></a><div><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11419837/Russian-troops-DESTROY-Ukraine-dam-flee-Kherson-dressed-CIVILIANS.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 12th, 2022</div></div>| Today's announcement comes amid doubts over whether Putin's new big beast Satan-2 - or Sarmat - will be deployed in the timescale the Russian government had boasted. A second test of the 15,880mph Satan-2 hypersonic missile 'may' come before the end of the year, Russia announced this week. Yet, earlier, it had been the Kremlin's intention that the huge new missile would be fully deployed with its forces before the start of 2023. Putin is seen as short of multiple missile types for his war with Ukraine.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> The Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research body, wrote in a report this week that while the strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure were "unlikely to change Russias battlefield fortunes," they were "causing major problems and generating new requirements for Ukrainian air-defense equipment."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/08/world/ukraine-war-news-russia-updates" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Nov 8th, 2022</div></div>| Ukrainian officials say they believe that Moscow will continue to try to overwhelm its defenses with sheer volume, as it did on Oct. 31, when Russia fired approximately 55 missiles targeting critical infrastructure. Only 10 are reported to have gotten through the defenses, but they inflicted considerable damage on energy structures, forcing Ukraine to ration power in order to prevent a collapse of the electricity grid. The Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research body, wrote in a report this week that while the strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure were "unlikely to change Russias battlefield fortunes," they were "causing major problems and generating new requirements for Ukrainian air-defense equipment." President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said his country was "gradually moving toward our goal" of completely defending its skies.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> The wave of strikes appears to be the largest since Oct. 10, when Russia stepped up its campaign to destroy electricity, water and gas infrastructure across Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-11-15-22/h_7f5e94a0dce088cef21f3ccdd455b183" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 15th, 2022</div></div>| Russia fired "around 100 missiles" at cities across Ukraine on Tuesday, Yurii Ihnat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force command, said previously. At least a dozen cities and districts were targeted, according to a CNN analysis of the missile strikes. The wave of strikes appears to be the largest since Oct. 10, when Russia stepped up its campaign to destroy electricity, water and gas infrastructure across Ukraine. The leaders also offered "full support" for Poland following an explosion in the country's east and said they would "remain in close touch" to determine the appropriate next steps.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Meanwhile, analysts warned that the Russian pullout Kherson in southern Ukraine is likely to be fraught with danger for both sides.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/11/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 11th, 2022</div></div>| Russia's announcement of its completed withdrawal from Kherson, the only Ukrainian provincial capital it captured since the war began, has been met with celebration by many in Ukraine and the West even prompting some in the U.S. government to suggest an opening for diplomatic talks. President Joe Biden, however, maintains that the timing of talks must be up to Ukraine. Meanwhile, analysts warned that the Russian pullout Kherson in southern Ukraine is likely to be fraught with danger for both sides. Ukraine's government said it was skeptical about Russia's withdrawal, although its forces on the ground appeared to be exploiting the opportunity to target large groups of Russian troops preparing to withdraw.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Up to now, the broad Nato consensus has been that Russian escalation would lead to stepped-up arms supplies to Ukraine, and that rather than any form of direct Nato involvement would serve as a deterrent to Russian recklessness.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-updates-kherson-victory-marks-beginning-of-end-of-russian-war-zelenskiy-says" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 15th, 2022</div></div>| "Deliberate armed attack is a real thing," Alberque said. "Two misfired cruise or ballistic missiles aint it." Up to now, the broad Nato consensus has been that Russian escalation would lead to stepped-up arms supplies to Ukraine, and that rather than any form of direct Nato involvement would serve as a deterrent to Russian recklessness. That is the most likely response this time, and there will be a debate within Nato on whether it warrants a step up in the sort of military assistance being provided.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> If successful, this will prevent Ukraine from providing heating and electricity to millions of consumers.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/ukraine-needs-urgent-help-to-counter-putins-energy-infrastructure-attacks/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 14th, 2022</div></div>| This bombing campaign is systematic in nature and appears to have been planned with the help of Russian technical experts who have a good understanding of Ukraines electricity infrastructure and weaknesses. The clear goal of the attacks is to prevent generators from delivering electricity to the power system and, in particular, to damage and destroy high voltage networks. If successful, this will prevent Ukraine from providing heating and electricity to millions of consumers. As a result of the damage caused by Russian airstrikes, Ukrainian transmission system operator Ukrenergo is already having difficulty balancing the power system and continuously delivering electricity.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Russia fired "around 100 missiles" at cities across Ukraine on Tuesday, according to Yurii Ihnat, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force command.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-11-15-22/h_cd44ac10f6d0449f9462d6783595aa1e" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 15th, 2022</div></div>| Russia fired "around 100 missiles" at cities across Ukraine on Tuesday, according to Yurii Ihnat, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force command.

|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Russian claims of Su-57s firing missiles at Ukrainian targets at stand-off distances are difficult to substantiate, says the West.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.firstpost.com/opinion-news-expert-views-news-analysis-firstpost-viewpoint/indias-fifth-generation-combat-aircraft-programme-has-to-succeed-if-it-wants-be-part-of-the-big-league-11206121.html" target="_blank">firstpost.com</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 9th, 2022</div></div>| In the initial months of the Ukraine war, the Su-57 was not seen. Russian sources said that they were preserving the assets for possible escalation. Russian claims of Su-57s firing missiles at Ukrainian targets at stand-off distances are difficult to substantiate, says the West. The Sukhoi Su-75 "Checkmate" is a single-engine, stealth, and light tactical aircraft under development.|
