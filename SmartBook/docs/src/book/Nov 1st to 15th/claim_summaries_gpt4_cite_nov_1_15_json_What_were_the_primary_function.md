Before its destruction, the Russian headquarters in Melitopol served as a central location for various military and administrative functions. The facility housed personnel from the FSB special forces and contained barracks and equipment, indicating its role in coordinating military operations and housing troops within the occupied city <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Additionally, Melitopol's transformation into a "huge military base" under Russian occupation suggests that the headquarters was likely instrumental in managing the increasing influx of Russian forces and military assets into the city, which was a strategic position for the Russians in the southern part of Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The headquarters also played a part in Russia's broader efforts to consolidate control over occupied territories. This included the installation of surveillance equipment in local hospitals to monitor conversations and identify individuals deemed untrustworthy, as well as the establishment of branches of the Young Army Cadets National Movement, aimed at the militarization and indoctrination of schoolchildren. These activities indicate that the Russian headquarters in Melitopol was involved not only in military coordination but also in efforts to suppress Ukrainian national identity and prepare for long-term control and potential mobilization of the local population <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.
