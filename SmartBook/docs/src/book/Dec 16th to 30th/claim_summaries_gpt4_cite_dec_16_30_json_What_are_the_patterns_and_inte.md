The Kherson region in southern Ukraine has been subjected to intense and frequent Russian artillery assaults, with local officials reporting that the area has endured dozens of attacks daily. The city of Kherson, along with other recently liberated settlements, has been a particular focus of these bombardments. On one Sunday, the Kherson region was shelled 69 times, leading to at least three fatalities and six injuries, while damage to residential buildings and infrastructure was also reported <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The pattern of attacks has included the use of artillery, multiple rocket launchers, mortars, and tanks, specifically targeting residential areas on the western bank of the Dnipro River <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. In addition to Kherson, surrounding areas along the river, including the Dnipropetrovsk region and other settlements in the Kherson region, have been hit by mortar and artillery shelling <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Recent escalations in the conflict have seen a shift in Russian tactics, with reports indicating an increase in the number of attacks and the use of more precise weaponry, such as S-300 missiles <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The persistent shelling has inflicted colossal infrastructural damage, prompting local authorities to establish "invincibility points" to provide essential services amid power outages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Despite the ongoing Russian offensive, Ukrainian officials maintain that the dynamics of the conflict continue to favor Ukraine, with Russia experiencing a net loss in strength, capability, and territory over time <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. However, the sustained shelling of Kherson and its vicinity since the Ukrainian liberation of the west bank in November underlines the continued Russian focus on the region, with the pattern of attacks remaining fairly steady, marked by repeated targeting of civilian infrastructure and residential areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
