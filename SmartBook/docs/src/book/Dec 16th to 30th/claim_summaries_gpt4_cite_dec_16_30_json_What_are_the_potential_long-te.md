<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Continued missile strikes on Kyiv could lead to long-term destabilization of the city's energy infrastructure, exacerbating humanitarian crises and hampering the national economy, as evidenced by the heavy damages to Ukraine's electricity networks and the devastating impact on civilians and service delivery <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Moreover, these attacks threaten Ukraine's military capability and national security by causing direct losses to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and potentially limiting their ability to counter further aggressions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Continued missile attacks on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, could lead to devastating long-term consequences for the city's security and stability. The relentless targeting of energy supply facilities has already resulted in substantial damage, with an estimated 40% of Ukraine's network facilities transporting electricity being affected, which poses a threat to both civilian life and the national economy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Such attacks can have far-reaching impacts, including the loss of civilian lives, the destruction of critical infrastructure, and the hampering of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' operational capabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. If these assaults persist, they could lead to sustained emergency blackouts, further undermining the city's stability and potentially hindering the defense against the aggression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The ongoing missile attacks on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine have had severe impacts on the country's energy infrastructure and civilian population, with 40% of the network facilities transporting electricity being damaged, leading to widespread power outages and emergency blackouts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The attacks, which have been described as one of the largest since the start of the war, have not only resulted in the loss of lives but have also severely disrupted the living conditions of residents, with a significant portion of Kyiv's population facing challenges in heating supply <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. If these missile attacks persist, they threaten to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis by leaving millions without access to essential services during harsh winter conditions, further crippling the national economy and impeding the Ukrainian government's ability to maintain stability and security within the city <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Moreover, the continuous assaults on Ukraineâ€™s energy infrastructure by Russia, using both cruise missiles and attack UAVs, underscore the precariousness of the relative parity achieved in the air and highlight the difficulties in countering missile threats <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The introduction of more modern defense systems, such as the reported U.S. plan to send advanced Patriot missile systems, could be critical in bolstering Kyiv's defensive capabilities, though Russia has warned of unspecified "consequences" for such actions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The long-term consequences for Kyiv's security and stability include the potential for sustained humanitarian challenges, economic decline due to the devastation of critical infrastructure, and an ongoing threat to civilian life, compounded by the potential for escalating military responses as international support for Ukraine's defense capabilities grows <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

The enemy's airstrikes on energy supply facilities have devastating consequences for millions of our compatriots and the national economy. Civilians continue to die from aerial attacks and the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffer losses. The enemy's group bombing airstrikes are becoming a thing of the past, but the use of cruise missiles and attack UAVs still pose a mortal danger.|

The United States believed Mr. Putin was considering a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Burns explained. If he proceeded down this path, Mr. Burns warned, the West would respond decisively, in unison and the consequences for Russia would be severe.

This system, which integrates an existing munition and rocket at a relatively low cost, would enable the Ukrainian military to strike high-value Russian targets well beyond the range of current Western-supplied munitions. That would help Ukrainian forces further degrade Russian logistics and command and control and ultimately retake more territory. For this reason, the Pentagon should move without delay to provide Kyiv with the GLSDB.|

"We need more modern systems Countries should do everything and not wait." The U.S. is reportedly planning to send advanced Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, a development that Russias foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Thursday would lead to unspecified "consequences."

It is time we understood that as long as Putin remains in power, the war will continue. If, as is now possible, Russia forces a halt to Ukraines offensive momentum, this need not be long in duration nor disadvantageous to Ukraine. Russias military commanders are capable of learning lessons and are learning them; but the military system has limited capacity to absorb these lessons.|

Drones have emerged as a leading weapon for both sides during the conflict.|

But the United States still needs to step upboth by catching up with other nations by rightly recognizing Russias crimes in Ukraine as genocide, but also by showing that giving Ukraine the weapons it needs to win wont provoke Moscow into starting a new war on top of the one its already losing. Ukraine is asking for critical weapons and armor, and allies such as Germany can be nudged in the right direction by a strong example from the United States, which continues to limit Kyivs ability to end this war sooner. For fear of provoking Putin, the White House said earlier this year it wouldnt send HIMARSthe game-changing system with which one Ukrainian officer earned a medal, which he sent with Zelenskyy to give to Biden as a thanks.|
