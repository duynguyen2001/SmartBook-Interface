The situation at the nuclear power plant, which is currently under Russian control, has been described as "untenable", with calls for a security zone to be created around it <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. A team of 14 IAEA inspectors was dispatched to the site, two of whom are slated to remain there on a permanent basis to ensure the safety of the facility amidst the ongoing conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>IAEA Director General, Rafael Grossi, stated that the agency is "not going anywhere," highlighting their commitment to ensuring the physical integrity of the facility <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.
