Inspectors from the IAEA arrived at the nuclear plant on Thursday amid security concerns. After inspecting it, the agency's chief Rafael Grossi said the integrity of the plant had been "violated several times". Located in the city of Enerhodar in southern Ukraine, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is still being operated by Ukrainian staff.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Mr Grossi said that, based on the evaluation of all safeguards relevant information available to the IAEA, the Agency had found no indication that would give rise to a proliferation concern.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/situation-at-zaporizhzhya-nuclear-power-plant-untenable-protection-zone-needed-iaeas-grossi-tells-board" target="_blank">iaea.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| At the end of August, Mr Grossi led the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Ukraines Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ISAMZ). The mission established a continuous IAEA presence at the site to help ensure nuclear safety and security; it also allowed inspectors to complete vital safeguards activities. Mr Grossi said that, based on the evaluation of all safeguards relevant information available to the IAEA, the Agency had found no indication that would give rise to a proliferation concern.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Laying out the issues in stark terms, Mr. Grossi said the physical attacks sustained by the facility and that he personally assessed are simply unacceptable.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc15020.doc.htm" target="_blank">press.un.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called today for the creation of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the embattled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, warning the Security Council of a potential catastrophe should the facility sustain further physical assault amid reports of shelling. "We are playing with fire," Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned, as he outlined the findings from the newly released report on the IAEAs "historic" Mission to Zaporizhzhia last week to assess the conditions a visit that resulted from "painstaking" efforts to corroborate facts observed over six months. Laying out the issues in stark terms, Mr. Grossi said the physical attacks sustained by the facility and that he personally assessed are simply unacceptable. Operators are working under "extremely challenging" circumstances.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The IAEA followed its visit with a report about the safety, security and safeguards situation in Ukraine, including the findings from the mission to Zaporizhzhia, in which it expressed concern about the level of stress staff at the plant are experiencing.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.ibanet.org/nuclear-weapons-treaty-review-ukraine" target="_blank">ibanet.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Grossi confirmed in early September that the physical integrity of the station has been violated and that two IAEA experts will remain at the plant to monitor the situation. The global Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and other treaties limiting the spread of nuclear weapons give the IAEA, as the nuclear inspectorate, safeguarding powers including the ability to verify that a state is abiding by its international commitments not to deploy programmes for nuclear weapons purposes. The IAEA followed its visit with a report about the safety, security and safeguards situation in Ukraine, including the findings from the mission to Zaporizhzhia, in which it expressed concern about the level of stress staff at the plant are experiencing. Its hoped that a forensic evaluation will also be possible to ascertain and hold those responsible for the attacks on the nuclear power plant accountable for the damage.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> During its long-awaited visit to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found damage from attacks and that Russian military vehicles and equipment were being stored there.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/ukraine-situation-report-kharkiv-counter-offensive-may-have-begun" target="_blank">thedrive.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 6th, 2022</div></div>| "The main reason for Biden's decision is the risk of terrorism sanctions impeding food exports and Black Sea grain export deal. Given Russia's rhetoric about sanctions impeding grain and fertilizer shipments, a terrorism designation could give Moscow a pretext to scrap the deal." During its long-awaited visit to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found damage from attacks and that Russian military vehicles and equipment were being stored there. "While past events had not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, they represented a constant threat to nuclear safety and security because critical safety functions (containment of the radioactivity and cooling in particular) could be impacted," IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi noted in the organizations latest report on nuclear reactors in the warzone, released Tuesday.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The same reserve line can also provide back-up power to the ZNPP if needed.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-97-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine" target="_blank">iaea.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The three others were lost earlier during the conflict. However, the IAEA experts now present at Europes largest nuclear power plant located in the middle of a war zone also learnt that the 330/750 kV reserve line linking the facility to a nearby thermal power plant was delivering the electricity the ZNPP generates to the external grid. The same reserve line can also provide back-up power to the ZNPP if needed. In addition, plant management informed the IAEA team that one of the ZNPPs two operating units was disconnected in the afternoon today due to grid restrictions.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> "It is those facts, gathered during a site visit, that are needed for the IAEA to be able to develop and provide an independent risk assessment of the nuclear safety and security risks," he said at the time.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/vox-conversations-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Mixed" /></a><div><a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/9/3/23335504/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-iaea" target="_blank">Vox Conversations </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Sep 3rd, 2022</div></div>| Given the potential for catastrophe and lack of independent insight into the situation at the plant, Grossi addressed the UN Security Council on August 11, calling again for a mission to Zaporizhzhia; the agency has for months been asking to go to the facility to provide oversight and technical assistance. Since Russia and Ukraine, as parties to the conflict, have given the agency inconsistent information about the safety and operation of the plant, Grossi stressed the need for an independent fact-finding mission. "It is those facts, gathered during a site visit, that are needed for the IAEA to be able to develop and provide an independent risk assessment of the nuclear safety and security risks," he said at the time. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Europes largest, supplying approximately 20 percent of Ukraines electricity before the war and half of its nuclear power, according to the Washington Post.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Without blaming either warring side, Grossi said his big concerns are the plants physical integrity, its power supply and the staffs condition.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-7-midland-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cbs7.com/2022/09/04/ukrainian-port-city-kharkiv-come-under-russian-shelling/" target="_blank">CBS 7 Midland</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 4th, 2022</div></div>| IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said he will brief the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday on a mission he led to the plant last week. The 14-member delegation braved gunfire and artillery blasts to reach the plant last Thursday after months of negotiations to enable passage through the fightings front lines. Without blaming either warring side, Grossi said his big concerns are the plants physical integrity, its power supply and the staffs condition. Europes energy picture remained clouded by the war in Ukraine.|
