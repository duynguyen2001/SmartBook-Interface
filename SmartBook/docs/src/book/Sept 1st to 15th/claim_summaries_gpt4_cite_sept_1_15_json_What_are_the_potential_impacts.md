# What are the potential impacts of a price cap on Russian oil on global energy markets?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The introduction of a price cap on Russian oil by the G7 could potentially cause greater pressure on oil demand and exacerbate the ongoing energy crisis, while also significantly destabilizing oil markets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, such a measure could also weaken Russia's energy revenues and avert a global recession-triggering surge in oil prices, while ensuring the continued supply of Russian oil on the global market without allowing Moscow to continue making substantial profits <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The G7 finance ministers have agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil, a decision that the Eurasia Center's Earl Rasmussen believes could exacerbate the global energy crisis by increasing oil demand pressure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The G7 hopes this measure will ease energy market pressures and significantly reduce Russia's overall revenues <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Analysts suggest that while the price cap could potentially decrease Russia's energy revenues and avoid a surge in global oil prices, it might also result in shared global pain if Russia retaliates by shutting in production <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, the Kremlin warns of significant destabilization of oil markets if such price caps are implemented <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The G7 finance ministers' decision to impose a price cap on Russian oil could lead to significant instability in global energy markets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The move, which aims to cut down Moscow's overall revenues, could inadvertently increase pressure on oil demand and worsen the ongoing energy crisis <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Russia's potential response to shut down swaths of oil production could inflict additional pain globally, despite the price cap potentially tempering EU import bans and managing to redirect some Russian supply to alternative non-NATO buyers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>The price cap could, in theory, allow Russian oil to still enter the global market, limiting further supply crunch. However, it would thwart Moscow's ability to garner hefty profits from energy exports as it currently does <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Despite the controversies surrounding the impact of Western sanctions on Russian oil, the price cap could reduce Russian revenues and limit the impact of Russia's war on global energy prices, particularly for low and middle-income countries <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Yet, any further disruption to Russian gas supply could support elevated gas prices for the next two years or more, potentially depleting European gas storage reserves quickly in the event of an extra cold winter <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The decision of the G7 to impose a price cap on Russian oil will worsen the situation in global energy markets and backfire on the countries themselves, Washington-based Eurasia Center Executive Vice President Earl Rasmussen said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/world-int/22156-price-cap-on-russian-oil-to-worsen-energy-crisis-backfire-on-g7-countries-expert.html" target="_blank">helsinkitimes.fi</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 5th, 2022</div></div>| On Friday, the G7 finance ministers in a joint statement said they agreed to introduce a price cap for Russian oil. The decision of the G7 to impose a price cap on Russian oil will worsen the situation in global energy markets and backfire on the countries themselves, Washington-based Eurasia Center Executive Vice President Earl Rasmussen said. "I do not see such a decision of the G7 having their desired effect rather it will cause even greater pressure on oil demand and more likely further aggravate the energy crises.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> The Group of Seven most industrialized countries said they plan to implement a price cap for global purchases of Russian oil a measure the U.S. hopes will ease energy market pressures and slash Moscows overall revenues.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/time-magazine-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://time.com/6210576/g7-russian-oil-price-cap/" target="_blank">Time Magazine</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 2nd, 2022</div></div>| The Group of Seven most industrialized countries said they plan to implement a price cap for global purchases of Russian oil a measure the U.S. hopes will ease energy market pressures and slash Moscows overall revenues. "We confirm our joint political intention to finalize and implement a comprehensive prohibition of services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally," G7 finance ministers said in a joint statement.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Done right, the price cap mechanism could drive down Russia's energy revenues and avoid a recession-triggering surge in global oil prices.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/blogs/oil/091322-fft-g7-price-cap-russia-oil" target="_blank">spglobal.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 13th, 2022</div></div>| Platts Analytics forecasts Russian disruptions peaking at 1.5 million b/d in Q1 2023 due to the EU import bans which could be "tempered" by the price cap. Goldman Sachs estimates that the world can still expect to lose about 1 million b/d of Russian supply versus pre-war levels due to incomplete redirection to alternative non-NATO buyers under a price cap. Done right, the price cap mechanism could drive down Russia's energy revenues and avoid a recession-triggering surge in global oil prices. If Russia decides to bite the bullet and shut in swathes of production in retaliation the additional pain will be shared globally.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> If G7 leaders decide to impose price caps on Russian oil, it will lead to a significant destabilization of oil markets, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-02-22/h_cabe53256357ff6c0f9b754fdd074c05" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 2nd, 2022</div></div>| If G7 leaders decide to impose price caps on Russian oil, it will lead to a significant destabilization of oil markets, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday. "One thing we can say with certainty: making such a decision will lead to a significant destabilization of oil markets," Peskov told CNN on a conference call when asked if a potential price cap will hurt Russia financially.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> With price caps, barrels of Russian oil could theoretically still make their way onto the global market, thereby avoiding a further supply crunch but Moscow wouldn't be able to keep raking in hefty profits.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-01-22/h_ad99415cb83d1aec26a5536cf08c73fd" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 1st, 2022</div></div>| Some background: Russia's government is making just as much money from energy exports as it was before its invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, inflation is surging globally. With price caps, barrels of Russian oil could theoretically still make their way onto the global market, thereby avoiding a further supply crunch but Moscow wouldn't be able to keep raking in hefty profits.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> On the contrary, they are said to have contributed to the spike in global oil prices since the beginning of the Russian invasion in late February, and thus have increased Russian oil revenues rather than the opposite.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.intellinews.com/gustafson-russian-oil-exports-are-sanctions-working-256113/" target="_blank">intellinews.com</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| No aspect of the Western sanctions on Russia has been more controversial than their impact on Russian oil. It is widely asserted by the Western media (and of course by the Russians themselves) that the oil sanctions have failed. On the contrary, they are said to have contributed to the spike in global oil prices since the beginning of the Russian invasion in late February, and thus have increased Russian oil revenues rather than the opposite. But is that in fact the case, and if so, why?|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Halting flows to Europe from Russia, the worlds second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the top natural gas exporter, would likely further roil global energy markets and leave the world economy facing even higher prices.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/analysis-putins-energy-gamble-may-prove-a-double-edged-sword-for-russia/" target="_blank">euractiv.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 8th, 2022</div></div>| President Vladimir Putins threat to completely cut off energy supplies to the West in a deepening confrontation over Ukraine could prove to be a double-edged sword for Russia. Just before the European Union announced a price cap on Russian gas on Wednesday (7 September), Putin threatened to sever supplies if such limits were imposed, warning the West it would freeze like the wolfs tail in a famous Russian fairy tale. Halting flows to Europe from Russia, the worlds second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the top natural gas exporter, would likely further roil global energy markets and leave the world economy facing even higher prices. Alexei Miller, chief executive of Russian state-controlled gas giant Gazprom, said in August that European gas prices could surge to $4,000 per thousand cubic metres, from around $2,200 seen on Wednesday.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> "Such attempts will only destabilize the oil industry, the oil market," he said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/business/russia-oil-price-cap-g7-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 2nd, 2022</div></div>| But if the cap forces Russia to strike cheaper deals with trading partners by putting a ceiling on the price at which they can sell their products, it will still achieve its goals, the official added. Novak has called the proposals to impose restrictions "completely absurd" and said they could destroy the global oil market, TASS reported. "Such attempts will only destabilize the oil industry, the oil market," he said. Russia could offer alternative insurance for its oil shipments.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> The price cap is specifically designed to reduce Russian revenues and Russias ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russias war on global energy prices, particularly for low and middle-income countries, by only permitting service providers to continue to do business related to Russian seaborne oil and petroleum products sold at or below the price cap.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/g7-finance-ministers-statement-on-russias-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine" target="_blank">gov.uk</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| At their summit in Elmau, G7 Leaders reaffirmed a shared commitment to preventing Russia from profiting from its war of aggression, to supporting stability in global energy markets and to minimising negative economic spillovers, especially on low- and middle-income countries. To deliver on this commitment, today we confirm our joint political intention to finalise and implement a comprehensive prohibition of services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally the provision of such services would only be allowed if the oil and petroleum products are purchased at or below a price ("the price cap") determined by the broad coalition of countries adhering to and implementing the price cap. The price cap is specifically designed to reduce Russian revenues and Russias ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russias war on global energy prices, particularly for low and middle-income countries, by only permitting service providers to continue to do business related to Russian seaborne oil and petroleum products sold at or below the price cap. This measure would thus build on and amplify the reach of existing sanctions, notably the EUs sixth package of sanctions, ensuring coherence through a strong global framework.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Any more disruption to Russian gas supply, such as a full stoppage through Nord Stream 1, would support prices.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/why-europe-faces-climbing-energy-bills-2022-09-02/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 2nd, 2022</div></div>| Many gas market analysts expect prices to remain elevated for the next two years or more. Global competition for gas and coal this winter is expected to prevent prices from falling. Any more disruption to Russian gas supply, such as a full stoppage through Nord Stream 1, would support prices. Although European countries are on track to refill gas storage sites to a minimum level of 80% by Oct. 1, an extra cold winter could deplete those reserves quickly.|
