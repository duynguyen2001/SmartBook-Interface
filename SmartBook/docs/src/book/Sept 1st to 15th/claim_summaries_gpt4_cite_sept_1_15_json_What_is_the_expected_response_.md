Russia, being the world's largest exporter of crude and fuel combined, warned that this move could lead to destabilization of oil markets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

In the event that G7 nations decide to implement a price cap on Russian oil exports, Russia has warned that it will cease supplying oil to these countries <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Alexander Novak, has stated that Moscow will not work in a non-competitive environment, and will therefore not supply oil and petroleum products to companies or states that impose restrictions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Furthermore, Russian President Vladimir Putin has voiced a similar stance, threatening to stop all energy shipments, not just oil, if Russia's interests are contravened <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The G7 nations, comprising of the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, have agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil in an attempt to reduce Moscow's revenue and limit its ability to fund the war in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. However, implementing this price cap is expected to be complex and would require a ban on services enabling maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally above the price cap <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This move is part of a wider economic sanction strategy, which has yet to completely halt energy imports from Russia due to the potential catastrophic impact on EU countries, particularly Germany <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.
