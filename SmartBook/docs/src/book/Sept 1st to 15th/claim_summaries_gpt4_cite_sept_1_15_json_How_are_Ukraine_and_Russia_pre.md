The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its experts were told by Ukrainian staff at the nuclear facility that the plants fourth operational power line was down. The three other power lines "were damaged during Russian shelling earlier," Ukrainian nuclear operator Energoatom said last month.|

Russia and Ukraine accused each other of trying to sabotage the mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the plant in southern central Ukraine, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of trying to sabotage the IAEA mission to the plant, which sits on the south bank of a huge reservoir on the Dnipro River that divides Russian and Ukrainian forces in central southern Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/un-team-inspect-ukrainian-nuclear-plant-mission-avert-disaster-2022-09-01/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 1st, 2022</div></div>| Some members of the inspection team left after spending several hours there.

Since the early days of the conflict, the plant has been controlled by Russian troops but operated by Ukrainian staff.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the plant on Thursday for an independent inspection after they were delayed by yet more shelling.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/ZAPORIZHZHIA/mypmnznjqvr/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div></div></div>| Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling dangerously close to the plant. The damage to critical infrastructure around the facility has been significant, and there are fears more damage could lead to a radiation disaster in the country that still manages the cleanup of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster. Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the plant on Thursday for an independent inspection after they were delayed by yet more shelling. Russian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in early March as part of what Moscow calls its "special military operation" in Ukraine.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Since Russia and Ukraine, as parties to the conflict, have given the agency inconsistent information about the safety and operation of the plant, Grossi stressed the need for an independent fact-finding mission.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/vox-conversations-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Mixed" /></a><div><a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/9/3/23335504/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-iaea" target="_blank">Vox Conversations </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Sep 3rd, 2022</div></div>| While much of the push is presently focused on the city of Kherson, the Zaporizhzhia plant is still quite close to the front approximately 60 miles from Kherson itself and on the northern border of Russian-held territory. Given the potential for catastrophe and lack of independent insight into the situation at the plant, Grossi addressed the UN Security Council on August 11, calling again for a mission to Zaporizhzhia; the agency has for months been asking to go to the facility to provide oversight and technical assistance. Since Russia and Ukraine, as parties to the conflict, have given the agency inconsistent information about the safety and operation of the plant, Grossi stressed the need for an independent fact-finding mission. "It is those facts, gathered during a site visit, that are needed for the IAEA to be able to develop and provide an independent risk assessment of the nuclear safety and security risks," he said at the time.|
