While the US was informed of the drills, they come at a time of heightened tensions with the West over his invasion of Ukraine.

"Something bad" could be a "dirty bomb" an explosive loaded with radioactive material. Russia claims Ukraine wants to use one on the battlefield, although there is no evidence to support the allegation. A "dirty bomb" is not a nuclear bomb, and would be less harmful, but by using conventional explosives to spread radioactive material, it is an effective weapon of terror.|

Russia has provided no evidence to substantiate such a claim. Previous Russian assertions that Ukraine might resort to using banned weapons such as biological arms have stirred concerns in the West that Moscow might be preparing to stage "false flag" attacks and blame them on Kyiv.|

The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces were being prepared to operate in conditions of radioactive contamination due to threats of this purported attack using such a device, colloquially called a "dirty bomb."|

The Pentagon's readout of the call said Austin told Shoigu he "rejected any pretext for Russian escalation."

Kyiv and its Western allies say there is no truth to the accusation and that Moscow could be mounting a false-flag operation. Ukraine has invited experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit two facilities the Russian government says without evidence are involved in a plan to create a dirty bomb. More background: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the consequences for Russia if it uses a nuclear weapon in its war on Ukraine have been conveyed to Putin.|
