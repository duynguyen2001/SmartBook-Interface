The international community, represented by the United States, Britain, and France, plans to address the issue of Iran's arms transfers to Russia, including kamikaze drones, at a UN Security Council meeting, arguing that such transfers violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. This response indicates a collective effort to uphold international law and prevent the proliferation of drone technology that has been used in attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, as acknowledged by the US Department of State, which has warned against any business with Iran that could be linked to UAVs or the flow of arms from Iran to Russia, threatening to use sanctions against violators <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Additionally, the US has committed to "pursue all means" to "expose, deter and confront Iran's provision" of these drones to Russia, highlighting the seriousness with which the US views the threat posed by kamikaze drones and the potential for them to disrupt peace and security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In response to the use of kamikaze drones supplied by Iran in the conflict in Ukraine, the United States and NATO are encouraged to continue their policy of arms transfers to support Ukraine, including providing air-defense and counter-drone systems to address the new challenge posed by these drones <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The use of Shahed-136 drones by Russia to strike Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Odesa, and Zaporizhzhia has been met with international condemnation, with the US Embassy in Kyiv describing the drone attacks as "desperate and reprehensible" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The proliferation of this technology and the precedent set in Ukraine may lead to increased support for Ukraine in the form of defensive capabilities, as well as a concerted effort to prevent further distribution of such technology through diplomatic channels and the enforcement of sanctions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.
