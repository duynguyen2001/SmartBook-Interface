<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Western countries, including the United States, have committed to supplying Ukraine with air defense systems, such as the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), in response to Ukraine's urgent requests for assistance against drone attacks, with the first two NASAMS expected to arrive later in the year <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, despite ongoing pleas from Ukraine, some nations like Israel have refrained from providing military assistance due to geopolitical concerns, offering only humanitarian aid instead <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

Western countries have acknowledged Ukraine's urgent requests for air defense systems to counteract drone attacks, especially as Russia began utilizing Iranian-made drones. The United States and its allies committed to providing such systems, with air defense being a top priority discussed at the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels, as confirmed by Gen. Mark Milley <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. However, while the US has pledged eight National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), the complete delivery could take up to two years, with only the first two systems arriving later in the year <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, Israel, despite coordinating with Moscow in other regional conflicts, has refrained from military assistance to Ukraine due to concerns over Russian reaction, offering only humanitarian aid <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This exemplifies a varied response from Western countries, with some providing comprehensive support including security, economic, and humanitarian assistance, like the United States <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>, while others have been more cautious or selective in their support.

Western countries have responded to Ukraine's requests for assistance in countering drone attacks, albeit not fully meeting all demands. Ukraine has been asking for air defense systems since the war's onset, with urgency escalating due to the deployment of Iranian-made drones by Russia. Air defense systems featured as a top priority on Ukraine's weapon wishlist, and the US, along with its allies, acknowledged the need to provide these systems to protect Ukrainian airspace <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Despite the recognition of this need, not all requested systems have been provided promptly. The US has pledged eight National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) to Ukraine, but with the first two only arriving later in the year and the remaining potentially taking up to two years for delivery <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, Western nations have promised systems that can shoot down drones, but many are yet to arrive, and some may take months, indicating a gap between pledges and the current defense needs of Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In terms of support, the United States stands out for offering comprehensive security, economic, and humanitarian assistance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. However, Israel, while supporting Ukraine through humanitarian aid, has been cautious in providing military aid due to its sensitive relationship with Moscow <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The UK has also sanctioned Iranian entities and individuals in response to Iran's role in supplying drones to Russia for use in Ukraine, reflecting a form of indirect support by attempting to curb the drone supply chain <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Other Western countries, like those in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, are involved in discussions about protecting Ukraine's airspace, but the actual delivery of air defense capabilities seems to be lagging <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Iran's involvement in supplying drones used by Russia has been condemned by Western nations, with calls for a UN investigation, signifying diplomatic support for Ukraine's cause against the use of such drones <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

Air defense systems were one of the top three priorities on a Ukrainian weapons wish list presented during a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, according to a handout provided to defense ministers participating in the gathering. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters after the meeting on Wednesday that the US and its allies needed to provide Ukraine with air defense systems in order for Ukraine to help defend its airspace against incoming attacks from Russian forces. "Many countries have Patriot, many countries have other systems, theres a whole series of Israeli systems that are quite capable, the Germans have systems as we mentioned, so a lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems," Milley said.|

And the Israelis have previously exported UAV tech and components to Moscow, including two surveillance drones deployed by the Russian army, the Zastava and Forpost, licensed copies of Israeli-built platforms, according to a report from Conflict Armament Research. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Israel didnt join in the U.S. and European Union economic sanctions, but it did dispatch humanitarian aid including helmets and bulletproof vests for rescue teams to Ukraine. Fearing Russian umbrage, Israel has thus far refrained from providing Kyiv with military assistance, despite repeated entreaties.|

Kyiv has been pleading with the US and other NATO nations to help defend its airspace since the initial invasion by Russia Feb. 24, first calling for a no-fly zone over the country and later for donations of fighter jets and Patriot missile defense systems. The US has rejected all three requests, but in July pledged eight National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), which are used to protect the White House. The first two NASAMS will arrive later this year, though it could take up to two years to deliver the rest, US defense officials have said.|

Authorities said Moscow has also used them in assaults against Kyiv, Vinnytsia,Odesa and other cities across Ukraine in recent weeks. Ukrainian officials have pleaded with Western countries to step up their assistance in the face of the new challenge, in addition to developing its own technology to counter the strikes. Kamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system.|

On Wednesday, Israel's Defence Minister Benny Gantz said their position had not changed. "Our policy toward Ukraine is clear - we are on the side of the West, we provided humanitarian aid, took care of refugees and the wounded," he told Israel's Kan radio. "For obvious reasons, we did not want to involve ourselves in combat systems.|

Similar early warning technologies could be on offer to Ukraine, a spokesperson for Israel's Defence Ministry said. "Israel has a policy of supporting Ukraine via humanitarian aid and the delivery of life-saving defensive equipment," but would not deliver weapons systems "due to a variety of operational considerations," Gantz told the EU ambassadors. Russian embassy in Israel declined comment.|

Their use in swarms presents a challenge to Ukrainian air defences, a Ukrainian air force spokesman told The Associated Press. Western nations have promised to bolster Kyivs fight with systems that can shoot down drones, but much of that weaponry has yet to arrive and, in some cases, may be months away. While the deployment of unmanned aircraft "will give the Ukrainians yet another weapons system to worry about", it is unlikely to be a game changer, said Puri.|

Nasser Kanaani, the spokesman for Irans foreign ministry, said last weekend that the call by three countries was "false and baseless" and that it was "strongly rejected and condemned". In a letter signed by their UN envoys, the three European countries backed Ukraines request for a UN inquiry, arguing the drone use breached UN Security Council Resolution 2231 endorsing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The US has said the alleged export of "kamikaze drones" used in Ukraine could be a breach of the resolution, which could potentially trigger the automatically reinstating of international sanctions against Iran.|

The Treasury added Iranian drone maker Shahed Aviation Industries and three top Iranian military officials to its sanctions list, citing the supply of drones to Russia "for use in their illegal invasion of Ukraine". "Irans support for Putins brutal and illegal war against Ukraine is deplorable," British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said. "This is clear evidence of Irans destabilising role in global security."|
