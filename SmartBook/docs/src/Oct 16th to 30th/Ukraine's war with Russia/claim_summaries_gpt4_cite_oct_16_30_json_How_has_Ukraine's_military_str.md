Ukraine's military strategy has shifted from a focus on reclaiming territory lost since the Russian invasion on February 24 to a broader objective of recapturing all areas seized since 2014, including Crimea <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This change in war aims follows significant Ukrainian military successes, such as the Kharkiv offensive, which have reduced the incentive for Ukraine to negotiate and allowed them to gain the upper hand against Russian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The Ukrainian counter-offensive has been so effective that Russia, now facing setbacks on the battlefield, has seen its President, Vladimir Putin, resort to implied nuclear threats in a bid to deter further losses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Despite internal Russian criticisms of the Kremlin's handling of the war and the construction of defensive positions like the "Wagner Line" by Prigozhin, Ukraine has continued to assert its military objectives <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
Since the beginning of the war, Ukraine's military strategy has undergone significant evolution, adapting to the changing dynamics on the battlefield and the broader geopolitical environment. Initially focused on defending territory against Russian advances, Ukraine has shifted its declared war aims from merely recovering territory occupied since February 24 to recapturing all lands lost since 2014, including Crimea <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This change in strategy comes as Ukraine experiences military successes, such as the Kharkiv offensive, which have bolstered its position and reduced its incentive to negotiate, especially given Russian aggression and war crimes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Moreover, the Ukrainian forces have adopted an increasingly cautious strategy, advancing in small groups only after identifying breaches in Russian defenses, a reflection of both strategic prudence and the reality of manpower shortages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In response to Ukrainian advances and its own battlefield losses, Russia has mobilized additional forces and escalated its attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Despite this, Russian President Vladimir Putin faces criticism from within Russia for the lack of progress in the war, as well as international condemnation for the implied threats of nuclear weapons use <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Ukraine's military, reinforced by international support and a clear understanding of the high stakes involved, continues to press on, with the aim of not just resisting Russian aggression but also reclaiming lost territories, a stance that has been strengthened by the international community's reaffirmation of support for Ukraine's sovereignty <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

The unclassified strategy report comes as both China and Russia have escalated aggressions against their neighbors. China repeatedly threatens to control Taiwan, by force if necessary, and Russia invaded Ukraine in February and continues to attack Ukrainian towns and cities with missiles and even Iranian-made kamikaze drones. A classified version of the report was released to Congress earlier this year.|

Russia has the largest incentive to establish a ceasefire that would allow it to retain Ukrainian territory it now occupies and that it risks losing to the Ukrainian counter-offensive. Since the Kharkiv offensive, Ukraine has been on a roll militarily and has little reason to negotiate given Russian brutality against civilians, rampant war crimes, and efforts to eradicate Ukrainian national identity. Ukraine has also shifted its declared war aims from recovering all territory occupied since February 24 to recapturing all territory lost since 2014, including Crimea.|

Prigozhins efforts and messaging, including the creation of the "Wagner Line," are increasingly out of line with Kremlin rhetoric and are critical of what Prigozhin claims are slow-moving "bureaucrat-enemies." Such activism endears Prigozhin to Russian nationalists, who are dissatisfied with limited Kremlin escalation and MoD disorganization.|

Tehran denies supplying the drones to Russia and earlier this week said it was ready for "dialogue and negotiation with Ukraine to clear these allegations" after Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine should break diplomatic ties with Tehran. On Wednesday, Irans UN envoy, Amir Saeid Iravani, rejected the "unfounded and unsubstantiated claims" on the drone transfers and said that Tehran, which has abstained in votes on the war, wanted a "peaceful resolution" of the conflict, which began when Russia sent its troops into Ukraine on February 24. Iravani said Ukraines invitation "lacks any legal foundation" and called on Guterres "to prevent any misuse" of the resolution and UN officials on issues related to the Ukraine war.|

"[Ukraine] is forced to hurry with an advance while its rear structures remain operational," Igor Strelkov, a former "defence minister" in separatist Donetsk, who recently returned to the front line, wrote on Telegram on Sunday. Another analyst said Ukraines stalled advance reflects its manpower shortages and its increasingly cautious strategy of inching forward small groups. "It can advance only after identifying sizeable breaches in the Russian defence," Nikolay Mitrokhin, a Russia researcher at Germanys Bremen University, told Al Jazeera.|

That kind of diplomatic activity is the missing ingredient in the war in Ukraine. The big mistake is to believe that diplomacy is an alternative to strong military support for Ukraine. On the contrary, the two approaches should go hand in hand and be complementary to each other.|

Most designated targets had been hit, he said, adding that it was not his aim to destroy the country. Russia has increased the use of combat drones in Ukraine as it seeks to avoid using long-range precision missions.|

But Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing increasingly vocal criticism at home, as a growing number of war propagandists bemoan a perceived lack of progress and thousands of Russian men flee their country to avoid being forced to fight in Ukraine. Setbacks in its invasion of Ukraine have led to increased nuclear threats by Russia, echoing Cold War events like the little-known 1983 nuclear crisis. (Video: Joshua Carroll/The Washington Post)|

Martial law in the four annexed territories would allow the authorities to impose curfews, seize property, imprison undocumented immigrants, establish checkpoints, detain people for up to 30 days and forcibly resettle residents to another region. The president also ordered the creation of territorial defense forces, a type of civilian militia, in the four annexed regions, raising the possibility that Moscows forces may try to conscript Ukrainians to fight their own countrys forces, part of a broader effort to mobilize hundreds of thousands of new fighters as its forces suffer huge casualties. Mr. Putin has grappled with growing anger at home over his call-up of about 300,000 reservists to fight in the war.|
