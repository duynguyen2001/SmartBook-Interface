Local leaders in the annexed Ukrainian regions are expected to implement and enforce martial law by protecting critical facilities, maintaining public order, and increasing production to support the war effort, as President Vladimir Putin has conferred additional powers on them <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This regime allows for the restriction of people's movements and gives broader authority for law enforcement agencies, suggesting tighter security checks and possible restrictions on travel and public gatherings <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The leaders also have the power to ensure security and protect critical civilian and military infrastructure, which includes the authority for search and seizure, and detention of individuals for up to one month without charges or trial <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. President Putin's decree also placed these regions in a special regime that is one step below martial law, demonstrating an escalation in response to battlefield setbacks and ongoing security concerns <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has imposed martial law in four Ukrainian regions—Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson—that Moscow claims to have annexed, though these territories are not fully under Russian military control <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The decree, which was signed on Wednesday and announced at an online session of the Security Council, grants regional leaders additional powers to maintain social order, safeguard important facilities, and potentially includes restrictions on travel, public gatherings, tighter censorship, and broader authority for law enforcement agencies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. These leaders are also tasked with protecting critical civilian and military infrastructure and have been given the right to enforce restricted movement, as well as search, seizure, and the detention of individuals without charges or trial for up to a month <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In addition to the specific regions where martial law was declared, Putin conferred extra powers on the heads of all Russian regions, ostensibly to increase support for the war effort and to ensure security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. This includes the eight regions adjoining Ukraine, including Crimea, which are now under a special regime just below martial law, permitting restriction of people's movements and the protection of critical facilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. A coalition led by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin is expected to formulate proposals to instill order within three days following the decree, and heightened security measures have been extended across Russia, especially in regions along the Ukrainian border like Bryansk, Belgorod, and Krasnodar <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. These measures come in the wake of battlefield setbacks and are part of a larger strategy to bolster Russia's military position <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="1"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Putin conferred additional powers on the leaders of all Russia's 80-plus regions to protect critical facilities, maintain public order and increase production in support of the war effort.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-declares-martial-law-four-unilaterally-annexed-regions-ukraine-2022-10-19/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| The published Kremlin decree ordered an "economic mobilisation" in eight regions adjoining Ukraine, including Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014. It placed them in a special regime one step below martial law and allowed for the restriction of people's movements. Putin conferred additional powers on the leaders of all Russia's 80-plus regions to protect critical facilities, maintain public order and increase production in support of the war effort. But it was far from clear how fast or how effectively the new measures might bolster Russia's military position on the ground.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="2"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Additionally, while it was decreed by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday - the Russian military does not fully control those four regions, so what martial law will mean in reality is yet to be seen.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63323263" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Martial law means tighter security checks and restrictions on movement in the areas affected. But the war has already curbed the rights and freedoms of Ukrainians under occupation. Additionally, while it was decreed by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday - the Russian military does not fully control those four regions, so what martial law will mean in reality is yet to be seen. Heightened security measures are also coming into force across Russia - there will be new restrictions on movement in regions along the Ukrainian border, notably Bryansk, Belgorod and Krasnodar.|

Putin provided few details of what martial law would entail, but restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader authority for law enforcement agencies are likely. President Joe Biden called the tactic an intimidation attempt by Putin the "only tool available to him'' and said it won't work.|

Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree imposing martial law in four "annexed" regions of Ukraine Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson. Putins decree, announced on Wednesday, also gave additional power to authorities in Russian border regions and comes after a string of battlefield defeats. "We are working on solving very complex large-scale tasks to ensure security and protect the future of Russia," Putin said.|

Analysts and Ukrainian officials say the decree may not change much on the ground for populations living in parts of Ukraine already administered by Russia's military or its proxies. But in a related decree, Putin announced heightened security levels extended to Russian regions bordering Ukraine to protect critical civilian and military infrastructure. The provision gives authorities broad new powers including the right to restricted movement around the country, search and seizure, and detention of individuals in prison for up to one month without charges or trial.|

In a separate development, Russia's Vladimir Putin said he had signed a decree imposing martial law on four Ukrainian regions, including Kherson, which Moscow annexed last month in a move rejected as illegal by the international community. He told Russia's Security Council that it would give regional leaders additional powers to maintain social order and safeguard important facilities. On Tuesday night, residents in Kherson started receiving text messages, urging them to evacuate immediately to avoid shelling of residential areas by Ukrainian forces.|
