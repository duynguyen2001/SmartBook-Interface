## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Russia's suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative is poised to exacerbate the global food crisis by potentially causing a surge in food prices and a shortage of supplies, as the deal has been crucial in exporting over 9 million tons of grain from Ukraine, mitigating food scarcity <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The halt of the agreement raises the risk of civil unrest in Europe, where populations are already facing increased energy bills and food prices due to the ongoing conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

Russia's suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, due to its claims of a Ukrainian drone attack on its Black Sea Fleet, threatens to exacerbate the global food crisis by potentially increasing food prices and reducing the availability of crucial exports like grain and oilseeds <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This initiative has been instrumental in allowing over 9 million tons of grain to be exported from Ukraine, contributing to a reduction in soaring global food prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The impact of the war in Ukraine, including this recent development, has already led to a spike in energy bills and food prices in Europe, with the risk of civil unrest due to economic pressures <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The United Nations has warned that the failure to renew and maintain such agreements could lead to a crisis of availability of food and fertilizers, affecting food production and prices worldwide in 2023 and 2024 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Russia's suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, following an alleged Ukrainian drone attack on its Black Sea Fleet, threatens to exacerbate the global food crisis by obstructing the export of over 9 million tons of grain from Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Prior to the war, Ukraine and Russia combined accounted for nearly a third of global wheat supplies, with Ukraine being a top exporter of corn and wheat <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The Initiative's blockage of grain exports contributes to soaring energy bills and food prices in Europe, increasing the risk of civil unrest and challenging European support for Ukraine amidst the difficult transition away from Russian energy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The cessation of the grain deal not only risks a crisis of food affordability but also poses a potential crisis of food availability, as the absence of Ukrainian grain and fertilizers in the global market could jeopardize crops worldwide in the 2023 and 2024 planting seasons <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. This disruption comes despite the deal's success in lowering global food prices and providing relief to vulnerable populations facing severe hunger <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. With inspections and shipments already lagging behind due to the deal's administrative challenges, the suspension further endangers the Initiative's role in alleviating food shortages and underscores the critical need for its continuation as a humanitarian effort <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

However, Moscow's blockade of Black Sea ports earlier this year stalled millions of tons of grain exports from Ukraine. TheBlack Sea Grain Initiative brokered in July by the UN and Turkey ended months of the blockade, allowing grain ships to navigate a safe corridor through the Black Sea, helping alleviate global food shortages.
