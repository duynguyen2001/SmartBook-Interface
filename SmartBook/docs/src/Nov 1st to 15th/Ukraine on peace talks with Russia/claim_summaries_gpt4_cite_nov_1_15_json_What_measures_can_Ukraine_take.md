Ukraine maintains a firm stance that peace talks can only commence with the restoration of its territorial integrity and the withdrawal of Russian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. President Zelenskyy has legislated against direct talks with Putin, reflecting a commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty and justice for war crimes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. To ensure discussions of peace talks do not undermine Ukraine's position, the country seeks international support, including increased air defense, fighter jets, and calls for a NATO summit to prevent escalation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, emphasizing the non-negotiable terms for negotiations serves as a strategy to preserve the morale and focus of the Ukrainian people and their military <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Ukraine faces the delicate task of balancing the pursuit of peace talks with the maintenance of strong national resolve and military momentum. Despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's decree banning talks with Putin and demands for a full withdrawal of Russian troops, reparations, and punishment for war criminals <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>, the U.S. has urged Ukraine to signal openness to diplomatic discussions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. This approach is aimed not at immediate negotiations but at ensuring Ukraine retains the moral high ground and public support, which could wane without an end to the conflict in sight <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Additionally, the U.S. advocates for Ukraine to start any potential talks from the strongest position possible, ensuring that negotiations are on Kyiv's terms <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Maintaining such a stance helps to reinforce Ukrainian resolve and supports the ongoing military efforts, which have been bolstered by significant U.S. aid, enabling Ukraine to regain initiative and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>To strengthen its position, Ukraine could adopt measures, as suggested by nuclear experts and military dialogues, that do not require formal treaties but aim to prevent escalation and eventual nuclear use, including maintaining communication lines and holding consultations on military operations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. By continuing to equip Ukrainians with what is necessary for victory, the nation can seek a fair and lasting peace on its terms <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Ukrainian officials have already emphasized that any settlement must include the restoration of occupied territories <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>, while also pushing back against perceptions of Western pressure to negotiate, reaffirming that talks can only occur if Russia relinquishes territory occupied since the invasion <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Ukraine's commitment to these principles ensures that discussions of peace talks do not undermine the country's resolve or military efforts and keeps the focus on achieving a sustainable resolution that honors Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Ukraine demands a full withdrawal of Russian troops from its territory, reparations and punishment for war criminals.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/11/13/after-kherson-can-ukraine-and-russia-talk-peace" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 13th, 2022</div></div>| But are Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin willing to negotiate? And how would opening a dialogue reflect on their governments? Ukraine demands a full withdrawal of Russian troops from its territory, reparations and punishment for war criminals. Zelenskyy himself has signed a decree which unequivocally bans him from talking to Putin.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> His foreign ministry Dmytro Kuleba called for more air defence assistance, fighter jets and a Nato summit to stop further escalation.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-updates-kherson-victory-marks-beginning-of-end-of-russian-war-zelenskiy-says" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 15th, 2022</div></div>| Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he has "no information" about the situation in Poland. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said it represents "a very significant escalation". His foreign ministry Dmytro Kuleba called for more air defence assistance, fighter jets and a Nato summit to stop further escalation. We will continue to provide updates throughout the evening.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Besides addressing the root cause by cooperating to reduce regional tensions, nuclear experts and US-Russia military-to-military dialogues have emphasized a series of measures to help prevent escalation and eventual nuclear use: (1) maintain communication lines; (2) hold consultations on military operations and doctrine (to include provisions that would prevent escalation and rule out the first nuclear strike); (3) increase regular contacts between the two militaries (expanded to mid-level and regional commanders), including detailed notifications about intentions, threat perceptions, and potentially ambiguous exercises and operations; and (4) observe each others military exercises (Woolf 2021; Chalikyan 2021).|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://thebulletin.org/premium/2022-11/nuclear-notebook-the-long-view-strategic-arms-control-after-the-new-start-treaty/" target="_blank">thebulletin.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 27th, 2022</div></div>| First, with the war in Ukraine and the generally growing risk of regional conflicts involving China or Russia, the United States most pressing interest should be to minimize the risks of inadvertent or accidental escalation. The United States time would likely not be wasted here as ensuring "nonevents" constitutes "a strong mutual interest among the United States, Russia, and China" (Talmadge 2022). Besides addressing the root cause by cooperating to reduce regional tensions, nuclear experts and US-Russia military-to-military dialogues have emphasized a series of measures to help prevent escalation and eventual nuclear use: (1) maintain communication lines; (2) hold consultations on military operations and doctrine (to include provisions that would prevent escalation and rule out the first nuclear strike); (3) increase regular contacts between the two militaries (expanded to mid-level and regional commanders), including detailed notifications about intentions, threat perceptions, and potentially ambiguous exercises and operations; and (4) observe each others military exercises (Woolf 2021; Chalikyan 2021). Given Putins escalatory language regarding Ukraine, these measureswhich luckily do not require a formal treatycannot wait any further.|

The only way to accomplish this is to equip Ukrainians with everything necessary for victory. Negotiations must occur in response to the Ukrainians declaration, not Putins pathetic blackmail.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Responding to various media reports about a push for negotiation with Russia, Ukrainian officials on Tuesday said that an essential condition for any settlement of the war is the restoration of Ukrainian occupied territory.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-11-08-22/h_e4ee0ce0c78f2f1bacb5878596a1cdcd" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 8th, 2022</div></div>| Responding to various media reports about a push for negotiation with Russia, Ukrainian officials on Tuesday said that an essential condition for any settlement of the war is the restoration of Ukrainian occupied territory.

Its not enough to help Ukraine merely defend the territory it currently controls; we must help Ukraine win this war and defeat Russian forces. If negotiations prove to be the path Ukraine seeks to pursue, we should help them start from the strongest position possible so that any talks are carried out on Kyivs terms, not Moscows. Any negotiated outcome must ensure a lasting peace, not simply a respite for Russian forces to reconstitute themselves and invade another day.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Senior US officials have in recent weeks been urging Ukraine to signal it is still open to diplomatic discussions with Russia, amid concerns that public support for the country's war effort could wane with no end to the conflict in sight and neither side willing to begin peace talks, sources familiar with the discussions tell CNN.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-11-07-22/h_6c2ff3cbaca796c6dd4b513173d51648" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 7th, 2022</div></div>| Senior US officials have in recent weeks been urging Ukraine to signal it is still open to diplomatic discussions with Russia, amid concerns that public support for the country's war effort could wane with no end to the conflict in sight and neither side willing to begin peace talks, sources familiar with the discussions tell CNN. The discussions are not aimed at encouraging the Ukrainians to negotiate now rather, the US wants Kyiv to convey more clearly that it wants to find a resolution to the conflict and that Ukraine has the moral high ground, sources said.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The US has led international efforts to bolster the Ukrainian fight back against Kremlin aggression and has provided Ukraine with crucial military, economic, and diplomatic support, but recent statements from both sides of the political divide indicate that this support cannot be taken for granted.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/will-next-weeks-midterm-elections-impact-us-support-for-ukraine/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 3rd, 2022</div></div>| With Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine currently in its ninth month, the ongoing war is high on the agenda as Americans prepare to vote in next weeks midterm elections. The US has led international efforts to bolster the Ukrainian fight back against Kremlin aggression and has provided Ukraine with crucial military, economic, and diplomatic support, but recent statements from both sides of the political divide indicate that this support cannot be taken for granted. The most widely reported comments came from senior Republican and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who indicated in early October that a future Republican-controlled Congress would not be prepared to offer Ukraine any more "blank checks."|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> "There has to be a mutual recognition that military victory is probably, in the true sense of the word, not achievable through military means, and therefore you need to turn to other means," Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/first-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/10/1135738566/russia-is-retreating-so-why-is-the-u-s-nudging-ukraine-to-compromise" target="_blank">Up First</a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Nov 10th, 2022</div></div>| This is the latest military success for Ukraine since it launched a major offensive more than two months ago, giving it the clear momentum on the battlefield.

"There has to be a mutual recognition that military victory is probably, in the true sense of the word, not achievable through military means, and therefore you need to turn to other means," Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday. "When there's an opportunity to negotiate, when peace can be achieved, seize it," Milley told the Economic Club of New York.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Russia said on Friday that it was committed to achieving the goals of what it calls its "special military operation" in Ukraine, adding such goals could be achieved through peace talks but that Kyiv's position meant holding peace talks was impossible.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/turkey-seeks-ukraine-peace-talks-despite-western-actions-erdogan-says-2022-11-12/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 12th, 2022</div></div>| There have been no public attempts to reconvene peace talks between the two sides since initiatives to bring about a ceasefire in Istanbul during the first weeks of the conflict broke down without progress.

Russia said on Friday that it was committed to achieving the goals of what it calls its "special military operation" in Ukraine, adding such goals could be achieved through peace talks but that Kyiv's position meant holding peace talks was impossible.
