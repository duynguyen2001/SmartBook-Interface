## Summary

<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The potential Republican control of the U.S. Congress could lead to a more scrutinized and potentially reduced financial and military support for Ukraine, as indicated by growing conservative skepticism and statements by Republican leaders <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This shift may also influence President Biden's administration to tread more cautiously in its foreign policy towards countries like China and Saudi Arabia, amidst the heightened political polarization and the possibility of Congress blocking key presidential priorities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The U.S. midterm elections have the potential to reshape the nation's foreign policy, particularly in relation to aid for Ukraine, with predictions that a Republican-controlled Congress might limit the financial support currently provided to Kyiv <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Statements from Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy suggest a growing reluctance within the party to provide Ukraine with unconditional aid, indicating a possible shift in the bipartisan consensus that has thus far characterized U.S. assistance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. If Republicans take control, President Biden could face challenges in maintaining the same level of support for Ukraine, as well as in his approach to other foreign policy issues like relations with China and Saudi Arabia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Despite this, some analysts believe that the fundamental aspects of America's Ukraine policy are unlikely to undergo dramatic changes due to the attitudes of the U.S. establishment and electorate, which have not prioritized Ukraine as a key concern in the elections <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The outcome of the U.S. midterm elections has the potential to reshape the extent and form of American support for Ukraine amidst its conflict with Russia. The existing bipartisan consensus on aiding Kyiv could face challenges if Republicans, who have expressed growing skepticism regarding continued financial commitments to Ukraine, gain control of Congress <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's statement about not providing a "blank check" to Ukraine and the Wall Street Journal poll indicating dwindling support among Republican voters for the level of U.S. involvement in Ukraine underscore this shift <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Additionally, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield's assurance of unwavering American support to Ukrainians suggests that the administration's stance might face opposition from future lawmakers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The geopolitical implications of the U.S. elections are significant, with experts positing that the results could influence key global issues such as the war in Ukraine, the U.S.-China relationship, and the global economy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. A change in Congressional control could lead to more difficulty for President Biden's administration in pushing through aid for Ukraine, potentially affecting the country's ability to counter Russian aggression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This could, in turn, impact the overall geopolitical landscape, as the conflict in Ukraine has become a central point of contention between the U.S.-led West and Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The possibility of an executive agreement over a formal treaty illustrates the challenges in navigating foreign policy in a politically polarized environment, where bypassing Congress could provoke domestic backlash <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

But U.S. midterm elections Tuesday will define the amount and the shape of Washingtons future political and financial support for Ukraine. While that support has garnered strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress, a growing conservative opposition could complicate that next year if Republicans take control of the House. Recent comments from Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, saying lawmakers would not cut a "blank check" to Ukraine have more clearly reflected the partys growing skepticism about the cost of support for Kyiv.|

If Republicans win control of Congress, it could become more difficult for President Joe Bidens administration to push forward large packages of military and other aid for Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine held several rounds of talks in Belarus and Turkey early on in the war, which is now nearing its nine-month mark.|

This would be particularly valuable for the United States given the high degree of political polarization and low likelihood of bipartisan Senate support. The flip side of this advantage for the United States, however, is that bypassing Congress in this way could create political backlash for a president. Congress could potentially block funding for a president to implement an executive agreement with Russia or even hold other presidential priorities at risk.|

Pushkov, who had sanctions placed upon him by the European Union in March for voting to support Moscow's Ukraine policy, said he thought there was a chance that Republicans might target what he called Biden's "wasteful" Ukraine spending in the run-up to 2024 to try to hurt the Democrats' ratings. But a report drawn up by the Moscow-based Institute for International Studies, which shares its research with the Russian Foreign Ministry and other state bodies, concluded that the mood of what it called the U.S. establishment and the electorate meant the elections were unlikely to bring about major changes to Washington's Ukraine policy. Ukraine has rarely come up as a key voter concern, with those polled ahead of the election citing mostly worries on domestic issues like inflation, crime and abortion.|

Other flashpoints, like North Koreas rapidly accelerating provocations and uncertainty over Irans nuclear program, will also factor in. Of those, defending Ukraine and combating climate change could be the most impacted by results from this weeks election. At moments of domestic political turmoil, US presidents have often turned to foreign policy, where they can act with relatively few congressional restraints.|

Thomas-Greenfield will meet with Ukrainian farmers, crime scene experts who are collecting evidence of atrocities in the country, and Ukrainian President Zelensky.|

"Ukraine fatigue is a real thing for some of our partners," an anonymous US official reportedly told the Washington Post. As Tuesdays US midterm elections get closer, polls show that support for Ukraine among Republican voters is dwindling, meaning that the continuation of aid could be in jeopardy. According to a Wall Street Journal poll, 48 percent of Republicans said the US was doing "too much" to support Ukraine.|

The latest University of Maryland poll reached similar conclusions. With the outcome of Russias Ukraine war still very much in the balance, the coming US vote has the potential to shape the geopolitical landscape for the coming years. The Atlantic Council invited a range of experts to share their views on what the midterm elections might mean for Ukraine.|

Conflict with the US-led West, as the Kremlin frames the war in Ukraine, is now the main source of legitimacy for Putins government, which is why it launched the aggression in the first place. Losing some of the occupied territory will not necessarily undermine the government. On the contrary, it may lead to more people rallying behind the leader in the face of what many Russians perceive as an existential threat.|
