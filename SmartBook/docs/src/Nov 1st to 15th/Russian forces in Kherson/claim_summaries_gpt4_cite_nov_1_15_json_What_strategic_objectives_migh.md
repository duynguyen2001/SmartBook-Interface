The Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu ordered troops to withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region to preserve the lives of Russian soldiers and due to difficulties in maintaining supply lines to the strategic city amidst a Ukrainian counteroffensive <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This retreat from Kherson, a significant strategic and symbolic victory for Ukraine, is seen as a substantial blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin, particularly after the annexation declaration of the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The decision comes after Ukrainian forces have been making advances towards Kherson from two directions, making it the most notable military development since the Ukrainian sweep through the Kharkiv region in September <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
Russia's decision to order a withdrawal of its forces from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region is a significant strategic move. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu's announcement of the retreat was driven by the intention to save the lives of Russian soldiers in the face of a Ukrainian counteroffensive and the logistical challenges of maintaining supply lines to the city of Kherson <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. General Sergei Surovikin, the overall commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, recommended this withdrawal due to the difficulties in fully supplying and operating in Kherson, proposing to establish defensive lines on the more sustainable eastern bank of the river <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The move is also indicative of the Russian military's recognition of the tactical necessity to regroup and fortify positions where they have a greater ability to resupply and create more sustainable defenses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The retreat from Kherson, which follows Ukrainian advances and a Russian effort to relocate residents, represents a major victory for Ukraine and a significant setback for Russia, which had previously claimed the annexation of the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. While the withdrawal might serve Moscow's strategic aim of maintaining a land bridge between Crimea and the Russian mainland, it undermines the broader goal of linking Crimea to Odessa, a key Black Sea port <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the decision to withdraw could be part of a larger strategy to avoid a potentially costly and protracted battle for Kherson, which President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine suggests might be a move by Russia to regroup its forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Nonetheless, the retreat has been portrayed as a personal defeat for President Vladimir Putin, who had recently declared the permanence of Kherson's annexation to Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

Defence minister Sergei Shoigu on Wednesday announced Russia would pull out its troops from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, the first and only regional capital to be captured by Russian forces since they invaded Ukraine in late February. The decision, Russian officials said, was taken to save the lives of Russian soldiers in the face of a Ukrainian counteroffensive and difficulties to keep supply lines to the strategic city open. Kherson city, the capital of the eponymous province, is located on the west bank, or right side, of the Dnieper River, while much of the Kherson province is on the east of the river.|

Ukrainian victory in Kherson, one of the main objectives of Kyivs southern offensive, will be widely seen as a significant blow to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, only weeks after a high-profile ceremony in Moscow in which he announced the annexation of the Kherson region along with three other regions. In televised comments, General Sergei Surovikin, in overall command of the war, recommended the withdrawal of Russian troops from the west bank of the Dnieper River, citing logistical difficulties.

Russias new military commander Sergei Surovikin, a hardliner known for his aggression throughout his career, ordered the retreat from the regional capital to maintain control over the rest of Kherson. Having parts of Kherson east of the Dnieper River will still serve Moscows strategic aims to keep a land bridge between Crimea and the Russian mainland. But it might also end Russian efforts of linking Crimea to Odessa, a Black Sea port of Ukraine.|
