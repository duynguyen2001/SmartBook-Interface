This bombing campaign is systematic in nature and appears to have been planned with the help of Russian technical experts who have a good understanding of Ukraines electricity infrastructure and weaknesses. The clear goal of the attacks is to prevent generators from delivering electricity to the power system and, in particular, to damage and destroy high voltage networks. If successful, this will prevent Ukraine from providing heating and electricity to millions of consumers.|

At least a dozen cities and districts were targeted, according to a CNN analysis of the missile strikes. The wave of strikes appears to be the largest since Oct. 10, when Russia stepped up its campaign to destroy electricity, water and gas infrastructure across Ukraine. Herman Halushchenko, Ukrainian Energy Minister, confirmed that most of the targets Tuesday were energy facilities.|

The United States rejected Kyiv's prior request for the drones, concerned they could be shot down, were not essential to Ukraine's war effort and could escalate the conflict. But Ukraine is hoping that its latest pitch will change minds in Washington since it was coupled with the LONGBOW request and explicitly aimed at protecting civilians and infrastructure. As its forces were pushed back by Ukrainian troops in some areas, Russia ramped up attacks last month on civilian infrastructure such as the power grid and water systems, causing outages.|

According to a CNN analysis of the strikes, at least a dozen cities and districts were targeted. The wave of strikes appears to be the largest since Oct. 10, when Russia stepped up its campaign to destroy electricity, water and gas infrastructure across Ukraine. Looking forward, Sullivan pledged the United States allies "will continue to provide Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself, including air defense systems.|

At least a dozen cities and districts were targeted, according to a CNN analysis of the missile strikes. The wave of strikes appears to be the largest since Oct. 10, when Russia stepped up its campaign to destroy electricity, water and gas infrastructure across Ukraine. The leaders also offered "full support" for Poland following an explosion in the country's east and said they would "remain in close touch" to determine the appropriate next steps.|

Together with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba we condemn Russias recent escalation, including its attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, in particular energy and water facilities, across Ukraine using missiles and Iranian drones and trainers. Through these attacks, Russia is trying to terrorize the civilian population. Indiscriminate attacks against civilian population and infrastructure constitute war crimes and we reiterate our determination to ensure full accountability for these and crimes against humanity.|

The Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research body, wrote in a report this week that while the strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure were "unlikely to change Russias battlefield fortunes," they were "causing major problems and generating new requirements for Ukrainian air-defense equipment." President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said his country was "gradually moving toward our goal" of completely defending its skies. "As of today, we can say that the recent escalation of Russian missile and drone terror has only resulted in the world responding responding with new aid to Ukraine," he said in his overnight address on Monday.|

The Russian blockade of Ukrainian exports through the Black Sea since its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has worsened food shortages and a cost of living crisis in many countries. In a Tuesday night video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy credited Trkiye and the United Nations for making it possible for ships to continue moving out of Ukrainian ports with cargoes. "But a reliable and long-term defense is needed for the grain corridor," Zelenskiy said.|

And the lesson of that meeting is that Putins American adventure might be best understood as advance payment for a geopolitical grail closer to home: a vassal Ukrainian state. Thrumming beneath the whole election saga was another story about Ukraines efforts to establish a modern democracy and, as a result, its position as a hot zone of the new Cold War between Russia and the West, autocracy and democracy. To a remarkable degree, the long struggle for Ukraine was a bass note to the upheavals and scandals of the Trump years, from the earliest days of the 2016 campaign and then the presidential transition, through Trumps first impeachment and into the final days of the 2020 election.|
