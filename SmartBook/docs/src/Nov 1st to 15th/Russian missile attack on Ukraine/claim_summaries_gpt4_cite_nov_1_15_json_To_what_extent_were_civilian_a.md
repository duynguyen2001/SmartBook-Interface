On November 15th, Russian missile strikes caused significant damage to Ukraine's critical infrastructure, with 40% of Kyiv's population experiencing water shortages and around 270,000 homes in the capital without power due to targeted energy structures <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Ukrainian officials fear continued overwhelming attacks similar to those on October 31st, which, although only 10 out of 55 missiles penetrated defenses, resulted in substantial harm to the energy grid, prompting power rationing to prevent a total collapse <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. In response to the intensified targeting of civilian infrastructure by Russia, Ukraine has sought advanced air-defense systems from the United States to protect people and essential services, although earlier requests for drones were denied over concerns of escalation and their necessity in the war effort <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. President Zelensky reported that Ukraine has been hit by approximately 85 strikes, with the latest wave being one of the largest since Russia escalated its campaign against the country's utilities on October 10th <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

On November 15th, Russian missile strikes caused significant damage to civilian areas in Ukraine, resulting in widespread disruption to critical infrastructure. In the capital city of Kyiv, 40% of residents were left without water, and power supply was cut to 270,000 homes, indicating a substantial impact on the civilian population's daily life <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The attacks were part of a larger campaign that has seen at least 85 strikes launched on Ukraine, targeting not only Kyiv but also at least a dozen other cities and districts, damaging electricity, water, and gas infrastructure and leaving 7 million homes without supplies. The intensity of these strikes is reminiscent of the escalated campaign that began on October 10th and represents the largest wave of attacks since that date <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The consequences of the missile strikes extended beyond immediate material damage, with two agricultural workers killed by stray missiles feared to have exploded in Poland near the Ukraine border <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Additionally, the attacks have had a regional effect, impacting power supply in neighboring Moldova <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Human rights concerns have also been raised, with Amnesty International accusing Russia of war crimes and likely crimes against humanity for unlawfully transferring and deporting civilians from occupied parts of Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This pattern of targeting civilian infrastructure and populations underscores the broader strategy that has seen over a third of Ukraine's energy infrastructure destroyed and has led to a call for increased global support and pressure on Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

Only 10 are reported to have gotten through the defenses, but they inflicted considerable damage on energy structures, forcing Ukraine to ration power in order to prevent a collapse of the electricity grid. The Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research body, wrote in a report this week that while the strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure were "unlikely to change Russias battlefield fortunes," they were "causing major problems and generating new requirements for Ukrainian air-defense equipment."
