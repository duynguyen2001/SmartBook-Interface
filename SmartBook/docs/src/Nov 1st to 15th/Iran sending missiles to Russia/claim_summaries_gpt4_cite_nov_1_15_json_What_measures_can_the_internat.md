The international community also recognizes the need to bolster Ukrainian air-defence capacity to counter the threat of incoming Iranian-supplied drones used by Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has also acknowledged Iran's role in supplying drones and considering ballistic missile deliveries to Russia, emphasizing the threat this poses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. In the broader context of international security, there is a commitment to strengthen arms control and non-proliferation efforts, as evidenced by the international support for modernizing the United Nations and strengthening export controls on materials and technology that could be used to develop weapons of mass destruction <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
