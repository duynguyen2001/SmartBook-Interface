Iran's preparation to send a substantial cache of weapons, including short-range ballistic missiles and attack drones, to Russia has raised international scrutiny. Western officials, who closely monitor Iran's weapons program, have indicated that this shipment is significant as it includes advanced precision-guided missiles which could give Russia an enhanced capability on the battlefield <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The previous consignment from Iran, which comprised approximately 450 drones, has been reportedly used by Russia with deadly effect in Ukraine, thereby confirming the lethal nature of these weapons systems <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>To counteract and address the Iranian provision of weapons to Russia, the United States has declared its intent to deploy every tool at its disposal. This includes the imposition of sanctions and other financial measures aimed at disrupting Iran's UAV proliferation networks. The US State Department has been vigilant in its monitoring efforts, with spokespeople emphasizing the continuous pursuit of targets that may be suitable for such responses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Moreover, the EU has imposed sanctions over Iran's sale of drones to Russia, highlighting the gravity of these transfers and their implications on the conflict in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. These mechanisms are part of a broader international effort to ensure accountability and prevent the escalation of hostilities through the unchecked flow of arms.
