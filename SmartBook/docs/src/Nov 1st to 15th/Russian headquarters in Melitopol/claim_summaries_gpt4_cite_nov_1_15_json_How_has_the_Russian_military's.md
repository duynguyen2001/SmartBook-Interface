<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The occupation and transformation of Melitopol into a significant military base by Russian forces, utilizing civilian structures like houses, schools, and kindergartens for military purposes, has intensified the conflict by embedding military targets within residential areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This strategy has contributed to the complexities of the war, potentially increasing the risks to civilians and complicating Ukrainian military responses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
The Russian military's occupation of Melitopol has significantly altered the dynamics of the conflict in the region by transforming the city into a substantial military base, as described by Mayor Ivan Fedorov. Russian forces have been reported to be settling in confiscated local houses, schools, and kindergartens, with military equipment also being stationed in residential areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This occupation strategy not only affects the daily lives of civilians by denying them access to essential infrastructure but also complicates military engagement by using civilian structures for military purposes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Additionally, the presence of Russian forces in these civilian areas has led to reports of looting and the theft of resources, further exacerbating the hardship faced by the local population <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The Russian military occupation of Melitopol has seen a transformation of the city into a "huge military base," with the invading forces settling in local houses, schools, and kindergartens, according to Mayor Ivan Fedorov. This occupation strategy has not only militarized civilian areas but also restricted local residents' movements, notably near the Melitopol airfield, as civilians are prohibited from approaching this area <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The presence of military equipment in residential zones has likely increased the risk to civilians and complicated the dynamics of the conflict, impacting the local population's safety and the use of infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Additionally, the conversion of civilian structures into military installations by Russian forces has implications for the broader conflict. It can be inferred that this tactic may be part of a deliberate strategy to deter Ukrainian attacks on these positions due to the potential for civilian casualties, complicating Ukrainian military operations. Russian forces have been reported to engage in looting and theft from residents and infrastructure sites, exacerbating the challenges faced by the local population. The occupation has also led to the obstruction of critical management and provision of basic amenities, which are vital for the community, especially during wartime <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The use of civilian infrastructure for military purposes by Russian forces has, therefore, significantly affected the conflict dynamics in Melitopol and the surrounding region.
