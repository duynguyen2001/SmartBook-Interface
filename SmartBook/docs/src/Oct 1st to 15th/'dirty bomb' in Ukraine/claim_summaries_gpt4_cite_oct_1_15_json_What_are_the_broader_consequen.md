# What are the broader consequences for nuclear non-proliferation efforts if the dirty bomb accusations lead to an escalation in hostilities?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
If the dirty bomb accusations lead to an escalation in hostilities, it could undermine global non-proliferation efforts by normalizing the use of nuclear-related weapons and demanding a significant international response, possibly altering the global stance on nuclear engagement <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Additionally, such an escalation may increase the likelihood of other nuclear-capable states, like North Korea, to conduct further nuclear tests, challenging the international community's ability to maintain security and stability <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The allegations by Russia that Ukraine plans to use a dirty bomb, which are categorically denied by Ukraine and dismissed by Western allies, could potentially be used by Moscow as a pretext for escalating the conflict, undermining global nuclear non-proliferation efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Such escalation could provoke a significant international response, as the use of nuclear ordnance by Russia would not be ignored by global powers, including the United States, NATO, and others, who have warned of "catastrophic consequences" that could cripple Russia's military capabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Moreover, the involvement of a nuclear power like Russia in further hostilities adds a dangerous and potentially catastrophic dimension to the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Additionally, any move towards nuclear escalation, such as the potential North Korean nuclear test, would be seen as a "grave escalatory action" threatening regional and international security, further straining non-proliferation efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The recent accusations by Russia that Ukraine plans to use a dirty bomb, a weapon combining conventional explosives with radioactive material, have been met with skepticism and denials from Kyiv and its Western allies, fearing it could be a pretext for Moscow to escalate the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The international community, including NATO and the US, has warned of severe consequences should Russia resort to using nuclear weapons, with American officials stating that any such action would invite "catastrophic consequences" and could functionally end Russia's ability to wage war in the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The situation is further complicated by North Korea's potential nuclear tests, which add to global concerns about the stability of non-proliferation efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>If the dirty bomb accusations were to lead to an escalation in hostilities, it could severely undermine nuclear non-proliferation efforts. The use of a dirty bomb is seen as a tactic of terror rather than a strategic military weapon, and the involvement of countries in such actions could represent a dangerous shift from traditional state behavior, raising the specter of nuclear engagement in conflicts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Additionally, the possible normalization of nuclear threats or actions, as seen in Russia's military doctrine and the illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories, may provide justifications for nuclear strikes that other nations might emulate, further destabilizing global security and undermining the non-proliferation regime <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. This could lead to an environment where the threshold for nuclear use is lowered, and the risks of proliferation and nuclear engagement by states or non-state actors are heightened <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

A dirty bomb is a weapon that combines conventional explosives like dynamite and radioactive material like uranium. It is often referred to as a weapon for terrorists, not countries, as it is designed to spread fear and panic more than eliminate any military target.

Despite Perrys fearsand whatever Putins hopesthere is virtually no chance that the United States, NATO, the European Union, and even other nuclear powers such as India and China will simply shrug if Putin makes nuclear weapons just another form of usable ordnance. More to the point, Biden has already said to the Russians publicly and privately that America and its allies would impose "catastrophic consequences" on Russia and its military. I am reluctant to predict what those measures might look like, but they could functionally end Russias ability to make war in Ukraine and the Black Sea region.|

Absent that, America is almost certain to repeat the same foreign-policy errors as before. And when a nuclear power is in play, that adds an entirely new and potentially catastrophic dimension.|

Now, the world awaits for yet another nuclear test at Punggye-ri underground facilities, where U.S. surveillance satellites have detected preparation activities. "If they do such a test, from our perspective, that would clearly constitute a grave escalatory action that seriously threatens regional and international security instability," Defense Department spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder told reporters at the Pentagon.

The White House has said it would respond forcefully to any Russian use of nuclear weapons. Jake Sullivan, President Joe Bidens national security adviser, said that Russia would suffer "catastrophic consequences" if it crossed that line. Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed that warning, saying, "Its very important that Moscow hear from us and know from us that the consequences would be horrific.|

In a report published after the mission, the IAEA called for the "immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone" around the NPP and subsequently voted for a resolution calling on Russia to leave the NPP, which Russia said it would not do. The capture of the Zaporizhzhia NPP by the Russian army poses a vast range of threats, including radiation accidents, energy deficits, security and economic losses, and industrial espionage. Another Focus Ukraine piece explains why it is important not to normalize the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP.|

AOAVs Propaganda of the Deed report (Paper 2) shows how such a failure to address IEDs also plays well into the perpetrators hands in such cases. Communities remain isolated, humanitarian funds escalate to sustain IDPs in tented camps, reconciliation remains a distant dream, and a resurgence of violence becomes the inevitable consequence. What is clear, though, is that experience in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen to date should be sufficient evidence for Member States and others to prioritise more appropriately EOD funds, with a focus on clearance.|

While Putin may or may not have been bluffing when he threatened to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine last month, Xi must assume the worst if he wants to be viewed as a responsible leader. After all, Russias military doctrine allows for a nuclear strike to defend Russian territory against an existential threat. Russias illegal annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provides the pretext for such an attack.|
