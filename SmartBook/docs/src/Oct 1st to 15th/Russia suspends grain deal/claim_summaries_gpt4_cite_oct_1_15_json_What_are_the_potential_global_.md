<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The non-renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative could lead to a crisis of availability and dramatic effects on worldwide food production and prices, as the initiative is crucial for the timely and affordable distribution of fertilizers and food, impacting crops into 2023 and 2024 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Additionally, the cessation of grain exports under the initiative would exacerbate the global food crisis by reversing the relief it has provided in lowering global food prices and helping those most vulnerable to severe hunger <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The Black Sea Grain Initiative's potential non-renewal threatens to exacerbate an already critical global food security situation by impeding the flow of Ukrainian grain and oilseeds, crucial exports for many countries, potentially leading to shortages and increased food prices worldwide <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. With Russia's actions such as blockade of Ukrainian ports and export bans on commodities including fertilizers, the crisis of affordability could escalate into a crisis of availability, affecting food production and prices into 2023 and 2024 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The Initiative has been instrumental in mitigating severe hunger by successfully lowering global food prices and exporting over nine million metric tons of food products, emphasizing its importance in the face of the devastating global food crisis <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. If the agreement is not extended beyond November, developing countries already facing challenges like drought and famine could be disproportionately impacted, further endangering global food security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Black Sea Grain Initiative has played a critical role in mitigating the global food crisis by facilitating the export of Ukrainian grain, which is pivotal for global food security. If this deal is not renewed, there is a risk of a dramatic effect on food production and prices worldwide, as Ukraine is a significant exporter of wheat and corn, crucial for global trade <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The initiative has already allowed over nine million metric tons of grain to reach international markets, easing shortages and lowering food prices, which would otherwise escalate if the agreement ends, putting millions at risk of food insecurity, especially in poorer countries already facing high inflation and hunger <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Moreover, the renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative is imperative, as failure to extend it may result in reduced affordability and availability of food, endangering crops and exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis that has pushed millions towards food insecurity. The potential cessation of this agreement could see grain prices soaring once again, which would have a disproportionate impact on developing countries, some of which are already grappling with serious droughts and famines, such as those in East Africa <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The situation is further compounded by the reliance on Ukrainian grain exports by many countries, highlighting the importance of the Black Sea Grain Initiative in stabilizing global food supply chains <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> All these actions have exacerbated an already dire global economic situation and contributed to major price hikes and shortages in key Russian- and Ukrainian-produced commodities, with major implications for global food security.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/watch-list-2022-autumn-update" target="_blank">crisisgroup.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 10th, 2022</div></div>| Throughout the war, it has destroyed and stolen Ukrainian grain supplies and damaged grain storage sites. For months, it blockaded Ukraines southern ports in the Black Sea and closed off the Sea of Azov, while responding to Western sanctions by banning the export of many commodities from Russia, including the fertiliser that many countries rely upon. All these actions have exacerbated an already dire global economic situation and contributed to major price hikes and shortages in key Russian- and Ukrainian-produced commodities, with major implications for global food security. Moreover, grievances at Western capitals, while entirely understandable, should not stop governments around the world from taking a clear stand against violations of Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity and the repeated nuclear threats issued by its bigger neighbour.|

If fuel prices rise as expected, that will also increase the cost of food, which is already elevated due to the war in Ukraine and Russias earlier blockade of Ukrainian grain exports. That will have a disproportionate impact on developing countries, some of which, like Somalia and its neighbors in the greater East Africa region, are currently experiencing a serious drought and widespread famine. The OPEC+ decision to decrease production in order to drive up the price of oil should be re-evaluated, taking into account the impact it has on the war in Ukraine and on the overall global cost of food, especially in areas already pushed to the brink.|
