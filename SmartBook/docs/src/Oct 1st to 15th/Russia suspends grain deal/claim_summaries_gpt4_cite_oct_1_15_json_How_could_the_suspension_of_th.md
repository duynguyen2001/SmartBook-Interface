# How could the suspension of the grain deal affect the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative could exacerbate global food security issues, as it has been critical in mitigating food shortages by allowing the export of millions of tons of grain, which could heighten international pressure on the conflict parties <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Moreover, the halt of grain exports may intensify the economic strain on Ukraine, further damaging its war-torn economy and potentially influencing the dynamics of the military conflict with Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative could exacerbate the already tense military conflict between Ukraine and Russia by further destabilizing the region's economy and global food security. Ukraine's economy has been devastated by the war, with Russian actions such as blockades and destruction of grain supplies contributing to global food price increases and the threat of famine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Before the war, Ukraine and Russia were significant contributors to the global wheat trade, and the blockade on Black Sea ports by Russia earlier in the year severely hampered grain exports from Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The grain deal's suspension, as expressed by USAID Administrator Samantha Power, may reverse the progress made in lowering global food prices and providing relief to vulnerable populations, potentially leading to a drop in humanitarian donations and shifting the world's focus back to the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This could, in turn, lead to increased geopolitical tension and further use of food and energy resources as weapons in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which was brokered by the UN and Turkey in July, could exacerbate global food insecurity by halting the export of Ukrainian grain, a significant source of the global supply <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The initiative has been crucial in alleviating food shortages by allowing the safe transit of grain through the Black Sea and has exported over nine million metric tons of grain and other food products since its inception <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The potential cessation of this agreement comes as food insecurity has been rising globally due to various factors including climate shocks, regional conflicts, and the pandemic, with the war in Ukraine intensifying these challenges <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The interruption of grain exports could further strain the already severe global economic situation, potentially affecting the support and stance of governments worldwide regarding the conflict and the violations of Ukraine's sovereignty <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>On the military front, the suspension of the grain deal could influence the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia by affecting both countries' economies, which are already suffering due to the war <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Ukraine's economy has been devastated by Russian military actions, including the shelling and bombing of towns and cities, the stealing of agricultural hardware, and the destruction of grain storage sites <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Russia, while issuing repeated nuclear threats and experiencing its own economic pressures due to sanctions, has hinted at the possibility of not renewing the grain initiative, claiming it does not benefit the poorest countries and Russia itself <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The disruption of the grain deal could potentially leverage Russia's position in the conflict, as it may seek concessions or use the suspension as a bargaining chip in negotiations, while also impacting global perceptions and potential support for Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

For months, it blockaded Ukraines southern ports in the Black Sea and closed off the Sea of Azov, while responding to Western sanctions by banning the export of many commodities from Russia, including the fertiliser that many countries rely upon. All these actions have exacerbated an already dire global economic situation and contributed to major price hikes and shortages in key Russian- and Ukrainian-produced commodities, with major implications for global food security. Moreover, grievances at Western capitals, while entirely understandable, should not stop governments around the world from taking a clear stand against violations of Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity and the repeated nuclear threats issued by its bigger neighbour.|

Highlighting the Recovery and Development Plan, a draft of which was introduced at the International Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland in July, he pointed out that the war has had severe and far-reaching global repercussions, including on global food security. The Russian Federations actions, such as the blockade of Ukraines food exports in Black Sea ports, setting fields on fire, shelling farms and grain storages, and stealing agricultural hardware have raised food prices and increased the threat of famine. Further, Moscow has turned energy resources into weapons, using countries dependence on Russian oil and gas to achieve its political and geopolitical goals, especially in the run-up to winter.|

However, Moscow's blockade of Black Sea ports earlier this year stalled millions of tons of grain exports from Ukraine. TheBlack Sea Grain Initiative brokered in July by the UN and Turkey ended months of the blockade, allowing grain ships to navigate a safe corridor through the Black Sea, helping alleviate global food shortages. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the importance of the deal, adding that since July Ukraine has exported 8 million tons of food by sea.|

This life-saving agreement between Russia,Ukraine, and Turkey, brokered in July by the United Nations, has allowed the export of more than nine million metric tons of grain and other food products to populations around the world in the midst of a devastating global food crisis," USAID Administrator Samantha Power wrote in a statement Sunday. She touted the "tremendous success" of the deal so far, crediting it with lowering global food prices and providing relief to those "most vulnerable to severe hunger."

The deal includes a three-year side arrangement between the UN and Russia to help ensure exports of its own grains and fertilizers including ammonia from one of its major Black Sea ports as well. Putin began to complain last month that the Black Sea deal was not benefiting Russia and that most of the grain exports were not reaching the worlds poorest countries.

Such steps would undercut the dominance of the dollar as the international reserve currency of choice and undermine Washingtons global financial leverage at a time of great economic uncertainty. Similarly, halting U.S. military sales to Arab Gulf states could have unintended consequences, including accelerating their diversification of weapons purchases away from American defense companies to the benefit of competitors in Russia and China, but also France and the United Kingdom. This when successive U.S. administrations have been pushing Arab Gulf states to limit their growing defense cooperation with its global strategic competitors.|

Meanwhile, Italys newly elected right-wing government may bring havoc to debt markets in Europe and put stress on the European banking system (at least half a dozen major European banks see share prices collapsing and have price-to-book ratios less than 40%). Bankruptcy of a globally systemically important bank (G-SIB) such as CSFB is not inconceivable. Emerging markets throughout the world are in tough shape due to higher US interest rates and global crises sucking up global liquidity.|

Putin has repeatedly warned the West that any attack on Russia could provoke a nuclear response. It comes as Ukrainian forces reclaim dozens of settlements in the south of Ukraine, adding to a growing list of military setbacks for the Kremlin.|
