The Black Sea Grain Initiative, brokered by the UN and Turkey, has played a pivotal role in stabilizing global food prices by resuming exports of Ukrainian grain amid the ongoing conflict, with nearly 7.7 million tons of agricultural products exported since its inception, which has helped counter the threat of global hunger <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The initiative allowed the first ship to pass inspections on August 3, demonstrating the system's effectiveness, and by September 13, it facilitated the departure of 2.8 million tons of grain on 129 ships, contributing to a decrease in global food prices and improving access to grain for impoverished areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The UN-backed effort has not only shown the power of trade in times of crisis but has also led to a six-month consecutive decline in the FAO Food Price Index, with the effect beginning even before the deal's official signing due to market anticipation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, despite the positive outcomes of the initiative, the ongoing conflict continues to affect commodity prices, as seen with the rise in prices following the invasion and the record export forecast for Russian wheat, highlighting the complex relationship between war, trade, and food security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.

The Black Sea Grain Initiative, which was established to alleviate global food shortages by resuming exports of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea, has had a significant impact on global food prices since its inception <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Brokered by the UN and Turkey, the agreement has allowed the safe passage of grain from Ukrainian ports, leading to the export of 7.7 million tons of agricultural products and stabilizing food prices while countering the threat of global hunger <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The initiative has been particularly effective in bringing down global food prices for the sixth consecutive month, even though cereal prices like wheat saw a rise in September due to uncertainties regarding the future of the deal <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing conflict and initial blockades by Russia, the Black Sea Grain Initiative has effectively contributed to a decrease in the FAO Food Price Index over a six-month period, with expectations of the deal's signing having a preemptive effect on markets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The deal has not only provided financial relief to Ukraine but has also facilitated the export of 2.8 million tons of grain on 129 ships, thereby easing access to vital Ukrainian grain for more impoverished regions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Furthermore, nearly a third of the Ukrainian exports have reached low- and lower-middle-income countries, although access remains limited for some of the hungriest nations like Somalia and Yemen <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The initiative's success in reducing food prices and enhancing food security underscores the critical role of international trade and cooperation during crises <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

Kubrakov said almost 7.7 million tons of agricultural products have been exported since the launch of the initiative, which "has stabilized food prices and countered the threat of global hunger." Russia casts doubt: Gennady Gatilov, Russia's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said this week that Russia could leave the deal, according to Reuters.|

Ocean Victorys crew turned off its radio transponder on March 1, and the $300 million party barge has been running dark ever since. Since the invasion, global grain prices have skyrocketed, boosting profits for Russian smugglers, while triggering what U.N. World Food Program director David Beasley on Sept. 15 called a "tsunami of hunger," affecting at least 345 million people.

Ukraine is reaping financially from the Black Sea initiative, according to a Ukrainian report. The deal was intended to bring soaring food prices down globally, which has happened for the sixth consecutive month, yet cereal food prices (like wheat) rose in September because of uncertainty about the deals future. This is where the UN plans to push Russian ammonia, an element in fertilizers, back into global markets.|

ALARA ISTEMIL AYDIL ( Trkiye ), stressing that it is not acceptable that more than 800 million people face hunger in the twenty-first century, noted that her country facilitated the Istanbul deal on shipment of Ukraines grain through the Black Sea. This is making grain available for global markets, and has helped bring down global food prices. Further, Trkiye has increased its ODA from $967 million in 2010 to more than $8.1 billion in 2020.|

This latest production cut provides them a lifeline. If fuel prices rise as expected, that will also increase the cost of food, which is already elevated due to the war in Ukraine and Russias earlier blockade of Ukrainian grain exports. That will have a disproportionate impact on developing countries, some of which, like Somalia and its neighbors in the greater East Africa region, are currently experiencing a serious drought and widespread famine.|

Highlighting the Recovery and Development Plan, a draft of which was introduced at the International Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland in July, he pointed out that the war has had severe and far-reaching global repercussions, including on global food security. The Russian Federations actions, such as the blockade of Ukraines food exports in Black Sea ports, setting fields on fire, shelling farms and grain storages, and stealing agricultural hardware have raised food prices and increased the threat of famine. Further, Moscow has turned energy resources into weapons, using countries dependence on Russian oil and gas to achieve its political and geopolitical goals, especially in the run-up to winter.|

As of October 12, more than 7 million tons of Ukrainian grain had left the country through the secured route, according to the U.N.'s Joint Coordination Centre. Over the past few months, Ukrainian officials have grown increasingly worried about how long the deal could last as Ukraine continued to successfully ramp up grain exports through its ports in the Odesa region rebuilding an economic lifeline for Kyiv and critical food supplies for hungry populations around the world. Those fears have now been confirmed.|
