Russian President Vladimir Putin declared martial law in four Ukrainian regions—Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk—despite the fact that these regions are not under full Russian control <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This decision follows the Kremlin's annexation process, in which it has sought to claim these territories through hastily arranged referendums that have been widely condemned by the international community as sham elections that don’t meet the standards of being free and fair <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Putin's announcement of martial law, which came into effect on October 20, 2022, is seen as a response to Ukrainian counter-attacks and advances on the battlefield, challenging Russian occupation and asserting control over these areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The martial law decree is part of a broader escalation in response to Ukraine’s successful counter-offensives, supported by Western weapons, which have put Ukrainian forces in a position to potentially regain territories like Luhansk <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Putin has granted "additional powers" to local leaders in all Russian regions, a move that could be interpreted as an effort to consolidate control and bolster administrative capabilities in the face of Ukrainian resistance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.
