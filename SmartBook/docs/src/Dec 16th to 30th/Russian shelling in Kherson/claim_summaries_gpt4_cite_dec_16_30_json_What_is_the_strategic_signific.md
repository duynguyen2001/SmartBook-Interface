<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Kherson region's strategic importance lies at the mouth of the Dnipro River and serves as a gateway to Russian-annexed Crimea, making it a key military objective for controlling southern Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The city's capture by Russia represented a significant gain, but its subsequent recapture by Ukrainian forces marked a major setback for Russian military operations and propaganda, as it was the only regional capital Russia had seized and the site of a retreat that was a personal humiliation for Putin <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The strategic significance of Kherson for Russian military operations stems from its location at the mouth of the Dnipro River and as a gateway to the Russian-annexed Crimea, making it a key region in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The city's occupation by Russian forces represented a significant territorial gain, as Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital captured by Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. However, the liberation of Kherson by Ukrainian forces marked one of Ukraine's most significant victories, undermining the Russian objective of establishing a land bridge to Crimea and dealing a blow to Russian military efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Despite the initial Russian withdrawal, the region remains contested with ongoing Russian shelling and attempts to defend their positions, underscoring its continued importance in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Kherson region holds considerable strategic importance in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict due to its geographic position at the mouth of the Dnipro River and as a gateway to the Russian-annexed Crimea <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The city's liberation from Russian forces marked one of Ukraine's significant gains, though this victory was soon overshadowed by continued Russian shelling, leading to a renewed state of fear and displacement among its residents <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The loss of Kherson was a significant setback for Russia and was seen as a personal humiliation for President Putin, given that Kherson was the only regional capital occupied by Russian forces during the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The capture and subsequent withdrawal from Kherson city by Russian forces have been part of a broader pattern of initial offensive success, followed by strategic defeats and retreats in the face of Ukrainian counterattacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Despite the setback in Kherson, Russia continues to maintain offensive operations in nearby areas and defends positions in regions such as Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, indicating the ongoing military significance of the south and east for both sides <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Moreover, the region serves as a land bridge to Crimea, which remains a minimal war objective that Russia has managed to secure despite its losses elsewhere <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="1"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Kherson region, located at the mouth of the mighty Dnipro River and serving as gateway to Russian-annexed Crimea, is strategically important.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-1.6698591" target="_blank">CBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Zhdanov said that fighting had intensified with Russia deploying armoured vehicles and tanks. Russian forces abandoned Kherson city last month in one of Ukraine's most significant gains of the war. Kherson region, located at the mouth of the mighty Dnipro River and serving as gateway to Russian-annexed Crimea, is strategically important. The joy of Kherson residents over the city's liberation has quickly given way to fear amid relentless Russian shelling from the east bank of the Dnipro, and many have since fled.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="2"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Russian troops were routed in the Kharkiv region and forced to retreat from the strategically important southern city of Kherson, the only Ukrainian regional capital to be occupied by Russia.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/2022-review-why-has-vladimir-putins-ukraine-invasion-gone-so-badly-wrong/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 19th, 2022</div></div>| Despite initial success due to Russias overwhelming artillery advantage, this offensive had largely stalled by midsummer with the initiative passing to Ukraine. The second half of 2022 was marked by a series of spectacular Ukrainian victories. Russian troops were routed in the Kharkiv region and forced to retreat from the strategically important southern city of Kherson, the only Ukrainian regional capital to be occupied by Russia. The withdrawal from Kherson was a personal humiliation for Putin.|

The major changes that occur here are that Russia significantly increases it losses in men, territory, and matriel (depleting Russian manpower, logistics bases, ammunition stocks, and Russias best weapons systems) while Ukraine gains that same territory Russia loses while receiving more advancedand new and increasingly superiorweapons systems from its Western allies, significantly increasing its capabilities over time and its overall comparative, qualitative advantages over Russia. Specifically, the way this has played out has been for Russia to lose catastrophically on multiple fronts, first outside Kharkiv; then in Izyum, Kupiansk, and Lyman; then in Kherson. Before, during, and after these successful counterattacks, Ukraine has been able to sink the Russian Navy Black Sea Fleets flagship, the Moskva (which I seem to have been the only person to predict in an article that Ukraine would sink, just days before it happened) and conduct other attacks on the Russian Navy without even really having a navy of its own.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="4"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[4]</font> On Novopavlivsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson - it is being defended.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/russo-ukraine-2022-12-23.htm" target="_blank">globalsecurity.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 23rd, 2022</div></div>| Russia continues to focus its efforts on conducting offensive actions in the Lyman, Bakhmut, and Avdiivka areas. On Kupiansk - trying to improve the tactical position. On Novopavlivsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson - it is being defended. There is still a threat of air and missile strikes on critical infrastructure facilities throughout Ukraine.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="5"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[5]</font> In November, the Russian army had to retreat southwards from the left bank of the Dnipro river, and abandoned Kherson, the only regional capital it had conquered in the first year of its second war against Ukraine.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.eurozine.com/hardened-by-cold-and-scarcity/" target="_blank">eurozine.com</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 28th, 2022</div></div>| The second set of objectives, the conquest of eastern and southern Ukraine, called New Russia in Putins propaganda, failed along with the great offensive in the Donbas. There, the Ukrainian army turned the tables in the summer and liberated the entire Kharkiv region. In November, the Russian army had to retreat southwards from the left bank of the Dnipro river, and abandoned Kherson, the only regional capital it had conquered in the first year of its second war against Ukraine. Despite all these setbacks, Russia still seized one minimal war objective: the land bridge to Crimea.|

Ukraine holds the battlefield momentum, having retaken much of the land that Russia captured early in the war, although Moscows forces still occupy large chunks of the east and south. And Russia is pressing its own advantage, readying more troops and launching aerial attacks on infrastructure that have deepened Ukrainians misery even as Russias army struggles on the ground. Last month, addressing a summit of leaders of the Group of 20 nations, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine presented a wide-ranging 10-point peace plan that called for the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, including Crimea and parts of the eastern area known as the Donbas that Russian forces seized beginning in 2014.|

"We will listen to the commanders in each operational direction, and I would like to hear your proposals on our immediate and medium-term actions," Mr Putin was seen telling military leaders in footage on state TV. Kyivs forces have made a series of major advances in recent months, including retaking Kherson the only major city captured by Russian forces so far. And the collapse of Moscows forces in eastern Ukraine earlier this year saw military bosses come in for sustained criticism from pro-Kremlin media figures.|

The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office said that shelling early Friday morning set on fire several apartments in a multi-story building.|

Russian forces "shelled the territory of Kherson region 69 times" on Sunday, said Yaroslav Yanushevych, head of Kherson region military administration, adding that the attacks killed at least three people, injured six, struck a hotel and apartment buildings, and also damaged infrastructure in the region that was recaptured in November. Heating systems and water supply impacted: Halyna Luhova, head of Kherson city military administration, gave the following updates: In one district, the heating system needed water from the Dnipro river, but collecting it "is impossible due to sniper fire and shelling from mortars, artillery and Grad multiple-launch rocket systems," she said, recommending that people from such districts leave the city.|

According to Reuters, Novak also said that Moscow expects it will have shipped 21 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe in 2022. 5:05 p.m.: Ukraines military said its forces have inflicted "heavy losses" on pro-Moscow troops in continued fierce fighting around the strategic eastern town of Bakhmut, with an official saying that dozens of Russian soldiers had been killed over the past 24 hours.
