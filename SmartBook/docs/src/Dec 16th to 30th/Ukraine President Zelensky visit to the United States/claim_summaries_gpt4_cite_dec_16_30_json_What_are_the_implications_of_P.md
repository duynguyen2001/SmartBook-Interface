Zelensky is already on his way to Washington, two separate sources said, for a visit that marks his first trip outside of Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February of this year. The visit to the White House, which hasnt been finalized and has remained tightly held due to security concerns, will include a meeting with Biden and top administration officials and is planned to coincide with the administrations intent to send the country a new defense assistance package. Biden will announce an additional $1.8 billion in security assistance to Ukraine during the expected visit, a significant boost in aid headlined by the Patriot missile systems within the package, a US official told CNN.|

It is worth mentioning that the destination of Zelensky's first trip abroad since the beginning of the conflict is the geographically remote US, rather than nearby Brussels or Berlin. This is a clear sign that in Kiev they count on the US, rather than on Europe, as their most important strategic partner and the leading champion of the Ukrainian cause.Second, the trip is an indicator that at this point the Biden administration is not willing to change its overall approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The most intriguing outcome of the negotiations in Washington was the decision by the White House to provide Ukraine with the Patriot Air Defense System, capable of bringing down cruise missiles, short range ballistic missiles, and aircraft at a significantly higher ceiling than previously delivered US air defense systems.The decision, however, should be regarded more as a symbolic political gesture rather than as a signal that the US military assistance to Ukraine is now raising to a new level.|

More hawkish voices, meanwhile, called for Ukraine to be "destroyed" altogether following Zelenskys meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden and widely praised address to Congress.|

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to the US on Wednesday to celebrate the transfer with US President Joe Biden. "It increases accuracy, it increases the kill rate, so it really does exactly what you want it to do which is protection on the ground on very specific targets," retired Maj. Gen. James "Spider" Marks previously told CNN of the systems capabilities. The Patriots radar system combines "surveillance, tracking, and engagement functions in one unit," a description from the Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) says, which makes it stand out among other air defense systems.|

Dmitri S. Peskov, President Vladimir V. Putins spokesman, said as the Kremlin has argued before that the trip showcased the United States commitment to fighting Russia "to the last Ukrainian."
