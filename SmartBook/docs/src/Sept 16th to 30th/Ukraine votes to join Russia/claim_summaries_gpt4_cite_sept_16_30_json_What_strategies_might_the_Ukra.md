# What strategies might the Ukrainian government employ to regain control of the four regions voting to join Russia?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The Ukrainian government may opt to continue their counteroffensive strategies in the regions at stake, as their recent offensive in occupied Kharkiv has proven successful and garnered the support of Western allies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. With only about 60-66% of Donetsk and Zaporizhia currently held by the Russian army, the Ukrainian government might seize the opportunity to regain control over these partially occupied territories <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
The Ukrainian government, in response to the contentious referendums held in the Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhia, and Mykolaiv provinces, may continue with their counteroffensive strategies to regain control over these regions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Considering the recent significant gains in territory following the successful offensive in Kharkiv, Kyiv could consider extending similar operations to these contested regions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The Ukrainian government may also leverage the support from its Western allies, who have been galvanized by Ukraine's recent victories and have openly criticized the legitimacy of the referendums <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Finally, recognizing that Russia does not have full control over the regions, Ukraine may also focus on consolidating control over the considerable percentage of the regions not currently held by the Russian army <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The Ukrainian government may employ a military counteroffensive to regain control of the four regions voting to join Russia. This approach has been successful in the past, with Ukraine regaining thousands of square miles of territory this month <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The recapture of most of occupied Kharkiv, for instance, demonstrated Ukraine's capacity to push back against Russian forces and has inspired support from Western allies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. However, an increased military response from Ukraine could be portrayed by Moscow as an attack on Russia itself, especially if the referendums result in formal annexation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Kyiv might employ strategies aimed at disrupting Russia's military activities within the occupied regions. For example, Ukrainians who end up in the Russian armed forces could be urged to sabotage and interfere with operations, and pass on intelligence to Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. To mitigate the risk of a potential nuclear response from Russia, the Ukrainian government would likely need to demonstrate caution and strategic diplomacy, possibly with the support of Western allies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Given the claims of voting coercion in these sham referendums <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>, Ukraine and its allies could also seek to challenge the legitimacy of the vote results on an international level <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Such a move could provide Moscow with a pretext to escalate its faltering war, which has seen Kyiv regain thousands of square miles of territory this month.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-28-22/h_6f4565919c9755ad4f49d534c0342a9f" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| Ukrainian officials say that turnout has been extremely low and that pro-Russian voters have been bused in from Crimea. Officials anticipate Russia could now move quickly to annex the four areas, potentially within days. Such a move could provide Moscow with a pretext to escalate its faltering war, which has seen Kyiv regain thousands of square miles of territory this month. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov previously indicated that if the regions announced majorities in favor of joining Russia, the ratification process would be fast and they could become part of the Russian Federation "quite soon."|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> The referendums could pave the way for Russian annexation of the areas, allowing Moscow to frame the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive there as an attack on Russia itself, thereby providing Moscow with a pretext to escalate its military response.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-21-22/h_7666f140f0a451c554d0f2011058de69" target="_blank">edition.cnn.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 21st, 2022</div></div>| Multiple Kremlin-backed authorities in occupied areas of eastern and southern Ukraine have announced they will hold referendums on formally joining Russia this week, in a move that threatens to redefine the parameters of the conflict. The referendums could pave the way for Russian annexation of the areas, allowing Moscow to frame the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive there as an attack on Russia itself, thereby providing Moscow with a pretext to escalate its military response. The latest developments follow a significant shift in Russia's position after a sudden and successful Ukrainian offensive through most of occupied Kharkiv this month, which has galvanized Ukraine's Western backers and led to recriminations in Moscow.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> If formally admitted to the Russian Federation, the occupied territories, where Ukrainian counteroffensives have gathered pace in recent weeks, will under Moscows nuclear doctrine, be entitled to protection from Russian nuclear weapons.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/22/russia-can-defend-new-regions-with-nuclear-weapons-medvedev-says" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 22nd, 2022</div></div>| The votes to join Russia are due to take place in the Russian-held parts of Ukraines Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia provinces, as well as part of Mykolaiv province, from Friday and are widely expected to produce results overwhelmingly endorsing joining Russia. The votes, which will take place under military occupation without any outside oversight, have been labelled shams by Kyiv and its Western allies. If formally admitted to the Russian Federation, the occupied territories, where Ukrainian counteroffensives have gathered pace in recent weeks, will under Moscows nuclear doctrine, be entitled to protection from Russian nuclear weapons. Moscow does not fully control any of the four regions it is expected to try to annex, with only around 60 percent of Donetsk and 66 percent of Zaporizhia currently held by the Russian army.|

Russian President Vladimir Putin could then portray any Ukrainian attempt to recapture them as an attack on Russia itself. He said last week he was willing to use nuclear weapons to defend the "territorial integrity" of Russia. Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, posted a brief celebratory message on Telegram.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> In a rare address to the nation, Putin made clear that he plans to annex large swathes of Ukraine in the coming week and is prepared to use nuclear weapons to defend his gains.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putins-nuclear-ultimatum-is-a-desperate-bid-to-freeze-a-losing-war/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 21st, 2022</div></div>| Russian President Vladimir Putin presented the international community with a nuclear ultimatum on September 21 as he dramatically raised the stakes in his faltering Ukraine invasion. In a rare address to the nation, Putin made clear that he plans to annex large swathes of Ukraine in the coming week and is prepared to use nuclear weapons to defend his gains. "If the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will without doubt use all available means to protect Russia and our people.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> By incorporating the four areas, Moscow could portray attacks to retake them as an attack on Russia itself - potentially using that to justify even a nuclear response.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-marches-farther-into-liberated-lands-separatist-calls-urgent-referendum-2022-09-19/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 19th, 2022</div></div>| Avoid draft orders. Try to move to the territory of free Ukraine," he said, urging those who did end up in the Russian armed forces to "sabotage," "interfere" and pass on intelligence to Ukraine. By incorporating the four areas, Moscow could portray attacks to retake them as an attack on Russia itself - potentially using that to justify even a nuclear response. Putin and other Russian officials have mentioned nuclear weapons as an option in extremis: a terrifying prospect in a war that has already killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted millions and pummelled the global economy.|
