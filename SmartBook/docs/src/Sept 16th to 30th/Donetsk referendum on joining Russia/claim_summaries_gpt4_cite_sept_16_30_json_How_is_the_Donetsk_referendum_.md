Putin of Russia a legally bogus pretext to gobble up their country. And they brought back memories of staged votes in 2014 in Crimea that were swiftly followed by Russias annexation of the peninsula. Ukrainian Regions Where Referendums Are Taking Place Kremlin-backed officials in four partly occupied regions of southern and eastern Ukraine are staging referendums on joining Russia. The voting is widely seen as a sham by Western officials.|
