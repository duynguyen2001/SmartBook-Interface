The detention of American citizens Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner in Russia has significantly impacted U.S.-Russia relations amid the ongoing Ukraine-Russia crisis. Whelan, who has been imprisoned for over three years on espionage charges, and Griner, a WNBA star detained since February on drug-related charges, remain central to complex diplomatic negotiations between the two nations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. President Joe Biden has engaged in talks with the families of the detained, expressing empathy and assuring them of the U.S. government's efforts to secure their release <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>These negotiations have been further complicated by the implications of potential sanctions and the tense international climate resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. There are concerns that such measures could hinder the release of Griner and Whelan <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Moreover, the situation has had a ripple effect on the WNBA, with top players opting out of competing in Russia during the off-season due to Griner's predicament and the political unrest <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The U.S. has proposed a prisoner swap, offering Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout in exchange for Griner and Whelan, but no significant progress has been publicly announced <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
