In late July, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the US had put forward a "substantial proposal" to try to secure the release of Griner and Whelan. Sources told CNN that proposal included a swap for convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout. Griners wife, Cherelle Griner, told CNN that Fridays meeting served as critical reassurance that the administration was committed to bringing her wife home from Russia.|

Secretary of State Antony Blinken took the unusual step of announcing two months ago that the administration had made a substantial proposal to Russia. Though he did not elaborate on the proposal, a person familiar with the matter has said the U.S. has offered to release convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The administration carried out a prisoner swap last April, with Moscow releasing Marine veteran Trevor Reed in exchange for the U.S. releasing a Russian pilot, Konstantin Yaroshenko, convicted in a drug trafficking conspiracy.|

The United States in late July said it has put forward a "substantial offer" to secure the release of the two Americans. Last month, Russia's foreign ministry said it was engaged in "quiet diplomacy" with the United States about a potential prisoner swap that could include Griner and Whelan. But there have been few public developments on the issue over the past weeks.|

Joe Biden has been in contact with both Griner and Whelans family members for months and as recently as last Friday. The Americans have apparently put a deal on the table: Griner and Whelan in exchange for convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout. If the Russians are ready to make an exchange, they know they have an eager partner.|

Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) star, was sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison on drug charges on Aug. 4, a verdict that Biden called "unacceptable". The United States in late July said it has put forward a "substantial offer" to secure the release of the two Americans. Last month, Russia's foreign ministry said it was engaged in "quiet diplomacy" with the United States about a potential prisoner swap that could include Griner and Whelan.|

According to Griners wife Cherelle, the New York Times, and the Atlantic, many suspect that she is being held as a political pawn in response to the United States involvement with Ukraine as tensions between the U.S. and Russia heighten. The Biden administration has proposed a prisoner swap under the mounting pressure for Griners release. The last swap occurred April 27, 2022, when the U.S. Government traded Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko for U.S. Marine Trevor Reed.|

Securing their release, securing the release of any American whos being arbitrarily detained is at the very top of my priority list. And as you said, we have put forward a substantial proposal to Russia. Im not going to get into the details or the back and forth in public; I dont think that serves the interests of getting to an agreement.|

And it was really important for him to be able to look into the eyes of the family members to just reinforce his own commitment to making sure that we get them home as rapidly as possible. Fundamentally, the United States, at the direction of the President, has been prepared to take significant steps in order to secure the release of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan. We have communicated that to the Russians.|

In return for Frerichs' release, U.S. officials allowed Haji Bashir Noorzai a prominent member of the Taliban, who had been in an American prison for 17 years on drug-trafficking charges to be granted clemency.|
