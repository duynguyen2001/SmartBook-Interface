The investigation into the Nord Stream pipelines leaks is being coordinated by multiple agencies across Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. Danish Energy Agency's head, Kristoffer Bottzauw, mentioned that it was too early to identify who would lead the investigations, and no one had yet examined the pipelines <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The Swedish Armed Forces, the Coast Guard, and the Maritime Administration, among others, are taking necessary measures, and Germany is coordinating a response with its police, local officials, and energy agency <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, according to the German Economy Minister Robert Habeck, security authorities from Germany, Denmark, and Scandinavia are analyzing the leaks to identify their cause <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. In the meantime, Sweden and Denmark are slated to lead the investigation into the leaks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The investigations into the Nord Stream pipelines leaks are being coordinated among Sweden, Denmark, and Germany, with all countries conducting their own inquiries into the incidents <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. While it is too early to determine who will lead the investigations, the head of Denmark's Energy Agency, Kristoffer Bottzauw, has indicated that no one has been to inspect the pipelines yet <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The Swedish Armed Forces, the Coast Guard, the Swedish Maritime Administration, and other relevant authorities are taking appropriate measures, with the Swedish Prime Minister stating that the leaks were likely the result of "a deliberate action" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. In Germany, the response is being coordinated with the police, local officials, and the energy agency <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>Authorities are keeping a safe distance from the area due to the risk of the leaking gas igniting over the water and in the air, but they state that there are few other security risks as the leak will only affect the environment where the gas plumes are located <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The Swedish national police force has opened an investigation, with the case currently under review by the Public Prosecutor's Office <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Furthermore, Sweden's security service has initiated a "gross sabotage" investigation, suggesting the possibility of foreign interference <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The Swedish National Seismic Network has detected two explosions near the location of the leaks, adding another layer to the investigation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The investigations are expected to be extensive, with results potentially taking up to 10 days due to the ongoing gas leakage from the pipelines <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Other Western countries and NATO have echoed that conclusion. German, Danish and Scandinavian security authorities are now examining the leaks and trying to identify their cause, according to the German Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who added that Europe is able to protect its own critical infrastructure. Authorities are keeping ships away from the area, citing the risk of leaked gas igniting over the water and in the air but say there are few other security risks, since the leak will only affect the environment where the gas plumes are located.|

CNN has reached out to Sweden's coast guard but did not immediately receive a reply. Berger said Sweden and Denmark would lead the investigation into the leaks but that results were likely to take up to 10 days because gas is still escaping from the pipelines. Berger said that in Germany's view, "everything indicated" the leaks were not the product of natural causes and that a non-state actor could not have caused this damage.|

The Swedish Armed Forces, the Coast Guard, the Swedish Maritime Administration and other relevant authorities are taking necessary measures, Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said. Germany on Monday said it was coordinating a response with police, local officials and the energy agency. Bjorn Lund, director of Swedish National Seismic Network told Al Jazeera that the group detected two explosions on Monday in the vicinity of the Danish island of Bornholm, "very close" to the location where Swedish maritime authorities said leaks were occurring.|

Danish Energy Minister Dan Jorgensen said the leaks were likely to last for at least a week, until the gas escaping from the pipes runs out. An investigation has been launched. European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen has promised the "strongest possible response" if the attack is proven to have been deliberate.|

The Danish Maritime Agency has told ships to avoid the area. German authorities have also said they are investigating the issue. Nord Stream 2 was never brought into operation, as Germany halted the pipelines certification process in late February in response to Russias actions in Ukraine, days before Moscow launched its all-out invasion.|
