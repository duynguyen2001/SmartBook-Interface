<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The Finnish government has closed entry for Russian citizens holding tourist visas, but allows entry for those visiting for work, study, treatment, business, and familial purposes<font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Despite curtailing short-term visas to the Schengen Area significantly, Finland will prioritize other forms of mobility for those with family ties, work, or student visas, and will allow entry for the roughly 100,000 Russians with long-term multiple entry permits <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

This restriction was not only in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine and the alleged sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines, but also due to the large influx of Russian tourists during the summer <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, most Russian citizens enter the EU through Finnish and Estonian border crossing points and similar restrictions are under way in Finland <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite the restrictions, the approximately 100,000 Russians with long-term multiple entry permits and those holding Schengen visas from other states will still be able to enter Finland <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
In response to Russia's alleged acts and influx of Russian tourists, the Finnish government has decided to significantly limit the entry of Russian citizens as tourists or for transit to other parts of the Schengen area <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This is in addition to the government's plan to enhance border control between Finland and Russia with a border fence <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The restriction, however, does not apply to Russians visiting for reasons other than tourism, such as family visits, work, studies, treatment, and business trips <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Additionally, those holding long-term multiple entry permits will still be allowed to enter, as will those with Schengen visas from other states, unless further action is taken <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>This move by Finland follows similar measures implemented by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, which have also started implementing entry restrictions for Russian citizens traveling for tourism or leisure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Prior to these changes, Finland had issued almost 800,000 visas to Russian citizens in 2019, but has since reduced the issuance of tourist visas to Russians <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Despite these restrictions, Finland is the only EU country sharing a border with Russia that remains open to Russian tourists, albeit with tightened visa issuance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. This is a crucial distinction as most EU states have almost completely shut down entry points from Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> "From today, the Finns prohibit the entry of Russians for tourist purposes.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-30-22/h_64cc02d609ee513f8ebc180276a169a5" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 30th, 2022</div></div>| The entry of Russian citizens to Finland is closed only for tourist visa holders, but other types of trips are still possible, according to the Russian ambassador to Helsinki. "From today, the Finns prohibit the entry of Russians for tourist purposes. Other trips are still allowed these are visits to relatives, work, study, treatment, business trips and so on," Pavel Kuznetsov said on Russian state TV channel Russia 24 on Friday.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> The government of Finland will "significantly" restrict the right of Russian citizens to enter the country as tourists or as transit when traveling to other parts of the Schengen area, the Finnish government said in a statement on Wednesday.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-28-22/h_a08b679f06dec8520259a3df6945c204" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| The government of Finland will "significantly" restrict the right of Russian citizens to enter the country as tourists or as transit when traveling to other parts of the Schengen area, the Finnish government said in a statement on Wednesday. "In addition, the Government received a briefing on ways to enhance control at the border between Finland and Russia using a border fence," it added.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> He said exceptions will be made for family visits, health, work or studies and humanitarian reasons.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/voice-america" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-bars-russian-tourists-/6768972.html" target="_blank">Voice of America (VOA)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| He said Russias "illegal" annexation referendums in eastern Ukraine and the alleged sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea were also considerations. But Haavisto says the measure was under discussion in Finland even before Putin's order due to the significant visits of Russian tourists during the summer, which caused controversy in Finland. He said exceptions will be made for family visits, health, work or studies and humanitarian reasons. The foreign minister said Finland will continue to work with the European Union on solutions to the border issues, adding it is important to strive for a more "unified line with Russia's Schengen and EU border neighbors."|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> On 19 September, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland started to implement entry restrictions for Russian citizens travelling solely for the purpose of tourism or leisure.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/update-situation-at-the-eu-s-land-border-with-russia-X3iWuK" target="_blank">frontex.europa.eu</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Most of the Russian citizens are entering the EU through Finnish and Estonian border crossing points. The number of border crossings has significantly increased in Finland following the announced mobilisation in the Russian Federation. On 19 September, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland started to implement entry restrictions for Russian citizens travelling solely for the purpose of tourism or leisure. Similar restrictions are under way in Finland.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Finland will instead prioritize other forms of mobility for those with family ties, work, or student visas.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/foreign-policy-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/09/19/europe-russia-visas-iron-curtain/" target="_blank">Foreign Policy</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 19th, 2022</div></div>| Before the pandemic, in 2019, Finland issued almost 800,000 visas to Russian citizens, around 3,500 per working day. This year, application appointments for short-term visas to the Schengen Area, a bloc of 26 European countries without border controls among them, had already been limited to 1,000 daily and were further curtailed to a mere 100 from September. Finland will instead prioritize other forms of mobility for those with family ties, work, or student visas. The roughly 100,000 Russians with long-term multiple entry permits will still be able to enter, as will those holding Schengen visas from other statesunless further action is taken to compensate for lack of an EU-level ban.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> This is a big deal, since it means the only land crossing between the EU and Russia that remains open for Russians is Finland (because Helsinki couldnt find justification under the national legislation for banning Russian tourists).|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-eus-russia-visa-ban-debate-reveals-the-blocs-new-power-center/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 23rd, 2022</div></div>| Some countries would like to see the EU go even further by not only ending privileged treatment, but banning tourist visas for Russians altogether. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland (all of which share a land border with Russia) jointly agreed to stop issuing Schengen visas to Russians for tourism, business, sports, and cultural purposesand on Monday, all four began blocking Russian tourists from entering. This is a big deal, since it means the only land crossing between the EU and Russia that remains open for Russians is Finland (because Helsinki couldnt find justification under the national legislation for banning Russian tourists). Even so, the country has considerably reduced tourist-visa issuance, accepting applications from Russians only once per week.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> From midnight to Friday, Russians can no longer travel to, or transit through, Finland if the main purpose is tourism.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/borders/2022/09/storskog-now-only-land-border-europe-open-russian-tourists" target="_blank">thebarentsobserver.com</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| From midnight to Friday, Russians can no longer travel to, or transit through, Finland if the main purpose is tourism. "The restriction will be valid until further notice," Pekka Havvisto said at the press conference.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Even Finland, which initially accepted thousands of Russian arrivals, has announced it will close its borders.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/foreign-affairs" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russian-federation/europe-disastrous-ban-russians" target="_blank">Foreign Affairs</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| Yet very few Russians have made it to the countries that, in theory, should be most eager and best equipped to accept opponents of Putin: the countries of the European Union. EU states have almost completely shut down entry points from Russia by land and air, and for most Russians, it is nearly impossible to get visas. Even Finland, which initially accepted thousands of Russian arrivals, has announced it will close its borders. These travel restrictions fly directly in the face of Western interests, both in the war in Ukraine and in support for anti-Putin movements in Russia.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> "Those crossing the border on tourism grounds alone will be barred from entering," Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told reporters on Friday.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/voice-america" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/latest-developments-in-ukraine-sept-23/6759848.html" target="_blank">Voice of America (VOA)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 23rd, 2022</div></div>| Russia previously used a referendum as a pretext for annexation in Ukraine's Crimea in 2014, which the international community has not recognized. 6:27 p.m.: Helsinki announced Friday that it would "significantly restrict the entry of Russian citizens" in the "coming days" after Finland saw an influx over its eastern border following Russia's mobilization orders, Agence France-Presse reported. "Those crossing the border on tourism grounds alone will be barred from entering," Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told reporters on Friday. This applies both to Russians traveling on tourist visas issued by Finland and tourist visas issued by any other Schengen country, Haavisto said.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said last week a ban on visas for Russian tourists could be against the Schengen zone visa agreement, per Reuters.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-tourist-ban-poland-estonia-latvia-lithuania-eu-schengen-finland-2022-9" target="_blank">businessinsider.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 20th, 2022</div></div>| Although the EU already banned Russian flights from its airspace over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Russian travelers have been touring countries in the bloc with the border-free Schengen visas by taking circuitous routes to their destinations or, if their locations allow, by simply driving across the border. Among the EU countries sharing a border with Russia, only Finland remains open to Russian tourists. Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said last week a ban on visas for Russian tourists could be against the Schengen zone visa agreement, per Reuters. However, the country has started tightening the issuance of visas to Russian tourists.|
