## Summary

<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The Finnish government's decision to significantly restrict Russian tourist and transit travel will drastically limit visa applications, but it won't prevent necessary humanitarian travels, national interests or Finland's international obligations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. However, this may present challenges given the high volume of Russian visitors in the past <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>, and the existing one million Schengen visas issued to Russians, with Finland set to keep its border with Russia open for non-tourist travel <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
The Finnish government has decided to "significantly" restrict the entry of Russian citizens as tourists or as transit passengers to other parts of the Schengen area, but will continue to allow travel for humanitarian reasons, national interests, and international obligations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This decision has been met with support from a majority of Finns who feel it is wrong for Russians to vacation in Europe while the conflict in Ukraine continues <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, this restriction leaves the question of what will be done with the one million Schengen visas already issued to Russians, as these visas usually have a validity of three to five years <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Despite closing almost all Schengen-area land crossings, Finland looks set to keep its border with Russia open, which could have implications for managing the flow of non-tourist travel between the two countries <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Finland's decision to significantly restrict the entry of Russian citizens as tourists or as transit to other parts of the Schengen area could have potential implications <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The Finnish government is considering ways to reduce Russian transit through the country due to risks posed by individuals travelling from Russia, especially after the invasion of Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, Finland appears set to keep its border with Russia open, which raises questions about the impact of this decision <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. For instance, almost a million Russians legally entered the EU through land borders between the start of the war and August 22, with entries to Finland and Estonia making up more than 60 percent <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>While Finland plans to close its borders to Russian tourist visa holders, other types of trips from Russia to Finland are still possible <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This could potentially have implications for the movement of Ukrainian citizens in need of temporary protection fleeing the eastern occupied region of Ukraine via Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Moreover, the restrictions do not completely shut down entry points from Russia, thereby supporting anti-Putin movements in Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. However, the EU's decision to limit issuing Schengen visas could exert pressure on Putin at home, as some European officials view fleeing Russians as potential security risks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

"The resolution aims to stop tourism and related transit from Russia altogether. It will drastically limit the capacity to receive visa applications in Russia," the ministry added. "The resolution will not prevent travelling when it is deemed necessary for humanitarian reasons, for national interests or for meeting Finland's international obligations."|

"In addition, the Government received a briefing on ways to enhance control at the border between Finland and Russia using a border fence," it added.|

Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Thursday the government was assessing risks posed by individuals travelling through Finland, and was considering ways to sharply reduce Russian transit. "The government's will is very clear, we believe Russian tourism (to Finland) must be stopped, as well as transit through Finland," Marin told reporters. "I believe the situation needs to be reassessed after yesterday's news," she added, referring to Putin's partial mobilisation order.|

Now, a majority of Finns support a ban on tourist visas for Russians and feel that ordinary Russians being able to vacation in Europe while Russian soldiers kill Ukrainians is simply wrong. That produced the call for tourist visa restrictions and other measures to stem the flow of tourists, while leaving other channels of movement open. Before the pandemic, in 2019, Finland issued almost 800,000 visas to Russian citizens, around 3,500 per working day.|

The problem wont go away by itself any time soon, as the validity of these visas is generally three years, with some lasting as many as five years. Although most direct flights to Europe from Russia have already been suspended (and nearly all Schengen-area land crossings closed), Finland appears set to keep its border with Russia open. To understand the scope of the issue, consider this: According to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex), almost one million Russians had legally entered the EU through land borders between the beginning of the war and August 22 (with entries to Finland and Estonia making up more than 60 percent).|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="6"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Some European officials view fleeing Russians as potential security risks.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/pbs-newshour" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-men-leave-country-fearing-call-to-fight-in-ukraine" target="_blank">PBS NewsHour</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 23rd, 2022</div></div>| The EU banned direct flights between its 27 member states and Russia after the attack on Ukraine, and recently agreed to limit issuing Schengen visas, which allow free movement across much of Europe. Four out of five EU countries that border Russia Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland also recently decided to turn away Russian tourists. Some European officials view fleeing Russians as potential security risks. They hope that by not opening their borders, it will increase pressure against Putin at home.|

EU states have almost completely shut down entry points from Russia by land and air, and for most Russians, it is nearly impossible to get visas. Even Finland, which initially accepted thousands of Russian arrivals, has announced it will close its borders. These travel restrictions fly directly in the face of Western interests, both in the war in Ukraine and in support for anti-Putin movements in Russia.|

"From today, the Finns prohibit the entry of Russians for tourist purposes.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="9"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[9]</font> On 19 September, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia introduced restrictions regarding the entry of Russian citizens travelling solely for the purpose of tourism or leisure.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/update-situation-at-the-eu-s-land-border-with-russia-X3iWuK" target="_blank">frontex.europa.eu</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Member States are also reporting entries by Ukrainian citizens in need of temporary protection as they flee the eastern occupied region of Ukraine via Russia. Frontex estimates that illegal border crossings are likely to increase if the Russian Federation decides to close the border for potential conscripts. On 19 September, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia introduced restrictions regarding the entry of Russian citizens travelling solely for the purpose of tourism or leisure. Similar restrictions are also under consideration in Finland.|

According to the authorities, this means that Finland will only accept about 100 visa applications per day for tourist purposes from citizens of Russia. Thus, Finland will reduce the number of visas issued to Russians by 90 per cent. In addition, applications for tourist visas from Russians will be received only on Monday in four cities, such as St. Petersburg, Petrozavodsk, Murmansk and Moscow.|
