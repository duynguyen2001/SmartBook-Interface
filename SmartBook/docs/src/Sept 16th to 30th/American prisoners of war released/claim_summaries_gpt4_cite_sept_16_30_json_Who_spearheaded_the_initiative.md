The prisoner exchange initiative between Ukraine and Russia was spearheaded by the government of Saudi Arabia, leading to the release of ten foreign nationals, including two Americans, Alexander John-Robert Drueke and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, who were captured in June while fighting in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The United States, particularly Secretary of State Antony Blinken, expressed gratitude for Saudi Arabia's role in facilitating the prisoner swap, highlighting the importance of including all prisoners of war in the negotiations, regardless of nationality <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Saudi Arabia's involvement in the initiative, particularly by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, not only facilitated the release of the prisoners, but also potentially improved the prince's international reputation following the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The Saudi government successfully transferred the released prisoners to Saudi Arabia and was responsible for procedures facilitating their safe return home <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This move was made possible due to carefully nurtured ties between Prince Mohammed and Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as a productive working relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.
