# What are the implications of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant's disconnection from the grid for Ukraine's national power supply?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The shutdown of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which produced 15% of Ukraine's electricity, and its disconnection from the grid due to shelling has led to a reliance on emergency diesel generators, creating a significant strain on the country's power supply <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The broader implications include an increased risk of a nuclear emergency due to the plant's need for external power to maintain vital cooling processes, as well as the potential impact on other Ukrainian nuclear facilities facing similar threats <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The shutdown of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe's largest nuclear station, has ceased electricity production, thus not contributing to Ukraine's power grid and instead requiring external power to maintain necessary cooling and safety systems <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The plant's disconnection from the grid due to shelling has led to reliance on emergency diesel generators, which poses a significant risk to the nuclear safety and security situation in the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This situation is further exacerbated by the plant being on the front line of the conflict, with military actions threatening the integrity of the plant and potentially increasing the likelihood of a nuclear emergency <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The implications for Ukraine's national power supply are grave, as the ZNPP used to produce 15 percent of the country's electricity, and its disconnection illustrates the broader vulnerability of Ukraine's nuclear facilities during the ongoing war <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe's largest nuclear power station, has faced disconnections from the power grid due to shelling and military actions amid the ongoing conflict, causing significant concerns for Ukraine's national power supply <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The plant, which once provided 15 percent of Ukraine's electricity, has been forced to shut down its reactors and switch to emergency diesel generators to maintain critical cooling and safety systems <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. This shift from being a power contributor to a power consumer places additional strain on Ukraine's already embattled energy infrastructure, which has experienced widespread disruptions from targeted strikes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Moreover, attempts by Russian forces to disconnect ZNPP from the Ukrainian grid and potentially redirect its power to Russia have further complicated the energy situation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The implications of ZNPP's disconnection are twofold: there is an immediate impact on Ukraine's electricity supply, and there are heightened risks of a nuclear accident due to the instability of power required for the plant's safe operation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Restoration of external power is critical to avoid prolonged reliance on diesel generators, which are not a long-term solution for the plant's electrical needs <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has underscored the precarious nuclear safety and security situation at ZNPP, with Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi calling for action to prevent a nuclear accident amidst the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The IAEA's concern about the integrity of ZNPP and the increased risk to all of Ukraine's nuclear facilities illustrates the broader implications for both national safety and the environment <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

The final working reactor at ZNPP was shut down in September as a precautionary measure. Nuclear plants supply power to the grid when operating, but when shut down they actually draw power from it in order to run vital cooling and safety systems, which means disruption to electricity supply is a major concern. On 23 November, shelling of power infrastructure in Ukraine by Russian troops led to blackouts that caused emergency diesel generators to start up at ZNPP, as well as at reactors across Ukraines three other nuclear plants that had previously made it through the war with relatively little disruption.|

The team of IAEA experts present at the power plant said it lost off-site power at 3:30 p.m. local time Wednesday when it was fully disconnected from the grid, "following reports of widespread military action targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure," IAEA said in a statement.|

Captured by Russian forces in March, Moscow has turned the grounds into a missile launching platform, presumably to deter the kind of devastating counter-battery strikes that Ukraine has been using to pound Russian logistical and headquarters targets in other regions. The plant continues to operate and there are signs Russia is attempting to disconnect it from the Ukrainian grid and redirect its electrical power into Russia But Ukraine has not completely refrained from targeting missile batteries and other miliary units houses at Zaporizhzhia, raising international coverage of a nuclear meltdown sparked by an errant artillery round. Whatever the inherent dangers, the plant remains very visibly on the front line between two warring states and an object lesson about the limitations of risk planning.|

It shows the potential nuclear safety and security risks facing all of Ukraines nuclear facilities during this terrible war, not just the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. While off-site power is now back at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant, yesterdays power loss clearly demonstrates that the nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine can suddenly take a turn for the worse, increasing the risk of a nuclear emergency." Khmelnitsky lost its grid connection at 18:35 local time on 15 November after its four operating power lines were taken out of operation by missile strikes over a two and a half hour period, according to reports submitted by Ukrainian authorities to the IAEA.|

Three nuclear power plants were disconnected from the grid for two days because of air strikes. UN experts are also worried that shelling around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the largest in Europe - might cause a radioactive leak. Shells have fallen near reactors and have hit a radioactive waste storage building at the plant but have not yet caused serious damage.|

That consideration is extremely important because Putins forces still occupy strategically vital areas even after Ukraines successes in western Kherson. Russia still controls the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plantthe largest in Europe and a major source of Ukrainian energy as well as an increasing danger to the environment in the irresponsible hands of the Russians. It still controls the vital hub of Melitopol, a city that sits astride essential lines of communication from Russia in the east to the lower Dnipro River in the west and from Ukrainian-held Zaporizhia Oblast to the north to Crimea in the south.|

Following Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Ukraine's operational nuclear power plants of Zaporizhzhia, Rivne, South Ukraine, and Khmelnytskyi were disconnected from the grid and "forced to rely on emergency diesel generators for the electricity they needed to ensure their continued safety and security," Grossi said. "We must do everything to prevent a nuclear accident at any of these nuclear facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we are already witnessing in Ukraine. The time to act is now."|
