The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been actively involved in ensuring the safety and security of Ukraine's nuclear power plants amid armed conflict. The IAEA has outlined seven indispensable pillars for maintaining nuclear safety, one of which is the need for a secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. In the event of external power loss, nuclear plants like the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) rely on emergency diesel generators, which have been resupplied with fuel by the IAEA to ensure they can continue to provide necessary electricity for cooling and safety functions for an extended period <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The IAEA has also stationed a permanent team at the ZNPP and has announced plans to send experts to three other operating nuclear power plants in Ukraine as well as Chernobyl, to assist in maintaining nuclear safety and security and to prevent nuclear accidents during the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has emphasized the urgency of the situation, noting that reliance on luck to avoid nuclear accidents is insufficient, and has been engaged in negotiations with Kyiv and Moscow to establish a safety zone around the ZNPP <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Despite the challenges posed by the active combat zone, the IAEA has continued its onsite support, which is critical in light of incidents where Ukrainian nuclear power plants, including the ZNPP, Rivne, South Ukraine, and Khmelnytskyi, were disconnected from the grid and had to depend on emergency diesel generators due to Russian strikes on energy infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The IAEA's role is crucial in preventing a nuclear accident, which would exacerbate the suffering in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

In some cases, there are immediate practical steps that could be taken. For example, to avoid a nuclear power plant accident, combatants could create "safe zones" around nuclear power plants as the International Atomic Energy Agency has recommended. Undoubtedly, use of a tactical nuclear weapon is the scenario with the potential for the most far-reaching consequences.|

Four trucks with diesel fuel have arrived at the site to refill the tanks, the IAEA team reported today. The need for secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites is one of the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security during an armed conflict that the Director General outlined early during the conflict. The IAEA team of experts also reported that repair work following the weekend shelling at the ZNPP site is continuing.|

It already has a permanent team based at Zaporizhzhia plant, which has been under the control of the Russian military since early March. Grossi said: "We will be at these nuclear power plants in the near future as part of our steadfast assistance to Ukraine in its efforts to maintain nuclear safety and security and prevent a nuclear accident during the conflict." Nuclear power plants need power for essential cooling and safety functions, even if in shutdown and not producing electricity.|

IAEA also said it has received information fromUkraine's national operator Energoatom that"due to a decrease in the frequency in the power system of Ukraine"all power unitsat two other plants theRivne Nuclear Power Plant and the Khmelnytskyy Nuclear Power Plants were automatically disconnected as part of emergency protection. "The need for secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites is one of the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security during an armed conflict," IAEA said.|

The four others remain in cold shutdown. The need for secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites is one of the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security during an armed conflict that the Director General outlined in March. Reactors need power for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions also when they are in shutdown mode and do not produce electricity anymore.|

Both sides have warned of the danger of a nuclear catastrophe. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, wants to create a protection zone around the plant. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said late on Sunday that he had no doubt Russian forces would leave the plant, where Ukrainian staff are still working.|

Russian attacks cut off essential power to all four of Ukraine's nuclear power plants last week, forcing operators to conduct high-risk procedures. "We must do everything we can to prevent nuclear accidents at any of these nuclear facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we already witnessing in Ukraine," Grossi said.
