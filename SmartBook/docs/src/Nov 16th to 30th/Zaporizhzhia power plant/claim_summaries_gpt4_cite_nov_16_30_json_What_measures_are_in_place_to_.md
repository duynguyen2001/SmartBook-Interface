The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe's largest nuclear power station, has been a focal point of concern during the ongoing conflict, leading to various safety measures being implemented. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has pushed for the creation of a protection zone around the plant to prevent a nuclear catastrophe, with ongoing negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow to establish such a safety zone. IAEA experts have been providing onsite support since September, and emergency diesel generators are in place to maintain the necessary cooling and safety systems in case of power loss, with four trucks of diesel fuel having recently arrived to refill the tanks. Repair work is also ongoing following recent shelling <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Moreover, the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has emphasized the urgency of preventing nuclear accidents at ZNPP and other Ukrainian nuclear facilities by relying on "good luck" and has proposed the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the power station. This measure, however, requires approval from external parties, as indicated by Rosatom chief Likhachev. Additionally, Ukrainian officials have called for international support, including air defense systems and equipment like transformers and generators, to restore energy needs and protect against further missile strikes, highlighting the broader defense needs to ensure the safety of the nuclear plant <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

Both sides have warned of the danger of a nuclear catastrophe. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, wants to create a protection zone around the plant. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said late on Sunday that he had no doubt Russian forces would leave the plant, where Ukrainian staff are still working.|

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of deliberately attacking the plant to cause "nuclear terror." Due to ongoing shelling, the plant has periodically had to rely on backup diesel generators for power to keep its reactors cool and prevent a meltdown. Zaporizhzhia is one of four nuclear power plants currently operational in Ukraine.|

Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), near the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar, is Europes largest nuclear power station and has been in Russian hands since in March. The final working reactor at ZNPP was shut down in September as a precautionary measure. Nuclear plants supply power to the grid when operating, but when shut down they actually draw power from it in order to run vital cooling and safety systems, which means disruption to electricity supply is a major concern.|

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi has repeatedly warned that a nuclear catastrophe could result if fighting in the region is not halted. Russian attacks cut off essential power to all four of Ukraine's nuclear power plants last week, forcing operators to conduct high-risk procedures. "We must do everything we can to prevent nuclear accidents at any of these nuclear facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we already witnessing in Ukraine," Grossi said.|

That consideration is extremely important because Putins forces still occupy strategically vital areas even after Ukraines successes in western Kherson. Russia still controls the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plantthe largest in Europe and a major source of Ukrainian energy as well as an increasing danger to the environment in the irresponsible hands of the Russians. It still controls the vital hub of Melitopol, a city that sits astride essential lines of communication from Russia in the east to the lower Dnipro River in the west and from Ukrainian-held Zaporizhia Oblast to the north to Crimea in the south.|

Four trucks with diesel fuel have arrived at the site to refill the tanks, the IAEA team reported today. The need for secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites is one of the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security during an armed conflict that the Director General outlined early during the conflict. The IAEA team of experts also reported that repair work following the weekend shelling at the ZNPP site is continuing.|

"If we have transformers and generators, we can restore our energy needs. If we have air defense systems, we can protect from the next Russian missile strikes. In a nutshell: Patriots and transformers are what Ukraine needs the most."|
