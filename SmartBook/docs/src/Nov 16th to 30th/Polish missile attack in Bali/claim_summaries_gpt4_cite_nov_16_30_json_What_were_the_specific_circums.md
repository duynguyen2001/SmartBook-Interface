On November 15, 2022, a missile struck the Polish village of Przewodow, located near the Ukraine border, resulting in the deaths of two Polish citizens <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This incident occurred during a significant wave of missile strikes by Russia on Ukraine, the largest since February, and marked the first time NATO territory had been directly impacted by the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Initial reports and reactions were mixed, with some Ukrainian officials and a since-corrected Associated Press report suggesting that the missile was launched by Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. However, President Joe Biden, speaking from the G20 summit in Bali, indicated that it was "unlikely" that the missile had been fired from Russia, based on its trajectory, a sentiment echoed by NATO leaders who also believed the missile was not a deliberate attack from Russia but possibly a Ukrainian missile that accidentally crossed into Polish territory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The situation prompted an emergency meeting of world leaders, including an urgent gathering by NATO and G7 allies to discuss the incident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Polish President Andrzej Duda noted that preliminary examination of the missile debris suggested it was not a traditional rocket explosion but could have been caused by the projectile's impact combined with remaining fuel <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Despite Russia's denial of ownership of the missile and calling the incident a "deliberate provocation," and Poland's more cautious stance pending further investigation, the global community, including G20 leaders, expressed concern over the potential for escalation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The incident underlines the heightened risk of spillover effects from the Russia-Ukraine war into neighboring countries, raising alarms over the broader implications for international security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

As world leaders scrambled to figure out where it came from, many were concerned that the conflict had moved to the brink of World War III. NATO leaders said they did not believe the missile was a Russian attack, but rather a Ukrainian missile accidentally shot into Polish territory. But should more countries be worried about the war spilling over onto their soil?|

Before any facts had been established, there was confusion in the Russian media whether to report on the story with outraged protestation or excitement.|

The cause of the explosion was a missile or missile parts that crossed into Poland, but the origin of the projectile remained unclear. Mr. Biden told reporters in Bali, Indonesia, where he was attending a G20 summit, that it was "unlikely" the missile had been fired from Russia, based on its trajectory.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="5"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Biden, in the waning days of a week-long Asia trip, was woken up by aides in the middle of the night in Bali, Indonesia, to let him know that a missile had killed two people in Poland, a U.S. official said.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-biden-white-house-scrambled-after-poland-missile-blast-2022-11-18/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 18th, 2022</div></div>| So when a missile struck a village in Poland near the Ukraine border on Nov. 15 and there were early claims it was launched by Russia, he and his top team of advisers were jolted into crisis mode. The United States and other NATO nations would be obliged to defend fellow NATO member Poland militarily if it were a Russia attack - a situation that could escalate into the global war most wanted to avoid. Biden, in the waning days of a week-long Asia trip, was woken up by aides in the middle of the night in Bali, Indonesia, to let him know that a missile had killed two people in Poland, a U.S. official said. Ukrainian officials publicly blamed Russia, as did a since-corrected Associated Press report, citing an unnamed senior U.S. intelligence official.|

Russia denied that the missile was theirs and called it a "deliberate provocation in order to escalate the situation." Polands response was more subdued, acknowledging that it would not have definitive evidence of the missiles origin until it could investigate further. This crisis illustrates the concept of the fog of war.|

Mr. Duda said that "preliminary examination of the scene indicates that there was no classic rocket explosion there, but that it was the result of the rockets fall, perhaps in conjunction with the explosion of the fuel that remained." He also emphasized that the events in Poland had come amid a "massive, unprecedented" Russian attack on Ukraine. "Ukraine defended itself which is obvious and understandable also by firing missiles whose task was to knock down Russian missiles," he said.|
