The capture of Soledar, a salt mine town in eastern Ukraine, would offer a strategic advantage to Russian forces as it could enable them to cut off Ukrainian supply routes and potentially encircle the nearby city of Bakhmut <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite its minimal military significance, taking control of Soledar has become symbolically important for Russia, seeking a victory after several defeats, and could aid the continuation of Russian offensives in the Donetsk region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Moscow's defence ministry has stated that controlling Soledar is key for further successful operations and could trap Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This town's fall to Russian troops, including the Wagner mercenary group, would allow a renewed focus on capturing Bakhmut, which has been a strategic target for Russia since the summer <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

The capture of Soledar by Russian forces, a small salt-mining town in eastern Ukraine, would provide a symbolic victory for Moscow, signaling its first notable gain in the Donbas region after several months of setbacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. While the military significance of Soledar itself is considered minimal <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>, taking control of the town would allow Russian forces to cut off Ukrainian supply routes to the strategically more important city of Bakhmut <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This could potentially trap Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut and give Russian troops a new advantage in the ongoing conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Moreover, the fall of Soledar to Russian control could serve as a morale booster for Russian troops and a political victory for President Vladimir Putin, offering some positive news after a series of defeats on the battlefield since the previous summer <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The capture of Soledar is also seen as a stepping stone for further Russian offensive operations in the Donetsk region, as it could facilitate the envelopment of Bakhmut and the consolidation of Russian territorial gains in the area <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite the ongoing fierce fighting and competing claims over the control of the town, the capture of Soledar would represent a tactical achievement for Russia in its broader military campaign in eastern Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Seizing the town would make it possible to cut off Ukrainian supply routes to the nearby city of Bakhmut and trap remaining Ukrainian forces there, it said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-fights-russian-assault-salt-mining-town-along-eastern-front-2023-01-09/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 9th, 2023</div></div>| But the capture of the town has taken on an outsized importance as it would, if confirmed, give Moscow a trophy for one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war following major battlefield setbacks throughout the second half of 2022. "The capture of Soledar was made possible by the constant bombardment of the enemy by assault and army aviation, missile forces and artillery of a grouping of Russian forces," Moscow's defence ministry said. Seizing the town would make it possible to cut off Ukrainian supply routes to the nearby city of Bakhmut and trap remaining Ukrainian forces there, it said. Moscow has been trying to seize Bakhmut for months.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> It added that "establishing control over Soledar makes it possible to cut off the supply routes for Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-1-13-23/h_e9b47e51554e95c246cb8a37d7f8cb3a" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 13th, 2023</div></div>| In recent days there have been competing claims over who has control of the town amid fierce fighting. Russia said the capture of Soledar was"important for the continuation of successful offensive operations in the Donetsk region." It added that "establishing control over Soledar makes it possible to cut off the supply routes for Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut." The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The capture of Soledar would represent a symbolic if not an especially strategic win for Putin after a long string of military setbacks dating back to last summer.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/13/europe/russians-capture-soledar-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Jan 13th, 2023</div></div>| CNN Russia said Friday its forces had taken the small town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine following weeks of fierce fighting, in what would be Moscows first notable victory in months, although Ukraine denied the claim. The capture of Soledar would represent a symbolic if not an especially strategic win for Putin after a long string of military setbacks dating back to last summer. But it does not suggest a significant capitulation of Ukrainian forces, nor a substantial change to the overall complexion of the war.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> The capture of Soledar would serve a military purpose while not constituting a turning point in the war, analysts said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-claims-control-soledar-eastern-ukraine-putin-success-rcna65240" target="_blank">NBC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The town lies in the eastern Donetsk region, one of four that Putin claimed to have annexed last year despite failing to fully control. After the Russian retreat from Kherson in the south, the focus of the war moved east through the winter to waves of Russian attacks and artillery battles against Ukrainian positions. The capture of Soledar would serve a military purpose while not constituting a turning point in the war, analysts said. It could also fulfil a personal goal of bolstering Prigozhins growing reputation.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Described as one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war, Moscows capture of Soledar would be a significant victory following major battlefield setbacks in 2022.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/14/fierce-clashes-in-bakhmut-after-russia-seizes-soledar-in-ukraine" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Jan 14th, 2023</div></div>| Described as one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war, Moscows capture of Soledar would be a significant victory following major battlefield setbacks in 2022. The battle for control of eastern Ukraine rages on with Russian forces focusing on Bakhmut a strategic city they have failed for months to conquer.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Kyiv, Ukraine To analysts, if Moscow is able to capture Soledar, a tiny salt-mining town in Ukraines war-scarred southeast, the "victory" would be little more than a consolation prize for Russias failing military effort.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/11/why-does-putins-chef-need-ukraines-soledar-so-badly" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Jan 11th, 2023</div></div>| Seizing the salt-mining town could mean more clout for the Wagner Group chief within the Kremlin, but Ukraine says it is still in Kyivs hands. Kyiv, Ukraine To analysts, if Moscow is able to capture Soledar, a tiny salt-mining town in Ukraines war-scarred southeast, the "victory" would be little more than a consolation prize for Russias failing military effort. To the Kremlin and pro-Moscow separatists, though, taking the town with a pre-war population near 10,000 would be a groundbreaking triumph.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Soledar's fall, while unlikely a turning point in the nearly 11-month war, would be a prize for a Kremlin starved of good battlefield news in recent months.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/arkansas-democrat-gazette" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/jan/12/russias-top-general-placed-over-troops-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Jan 12th, 2023</div></div>| The fate of a devastated salt-mining town in eastern Ukraine hung in the balance Wednesday in one of the bloodiest battles of Russia's invasion, while Ukraine's unflagging resistance and other challenges prompted Moscow to shake up its military leadership again. Russian forces used jets, mortars and rockets to bombard Soledar in an unrelenting assault. Soledar's fall, while unlikely a turning point in the nearly 11-month war, would be a prize for a Kremlin starved of good battlefield news in recent months. It would also offer Russian troops a springboard to conquer other areas of Donetsk province that remain under Ukrainian control, such as the nearby strategic city of Bakhmut.|
