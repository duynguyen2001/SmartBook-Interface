The civilian population of Soledar and surrounding areas faces severe long-term consequences due to relentless battles, including street fighting, which have resulted in numerous civilian casualties and injuries, as documented by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with 22 civilians killed and 72 injured since early December <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The ongoing conflict, characterized by intense ground fighting and aerial bombardments, has devastated the region's infrastructure, exacerbating the global food crisis and making it difficult for civilians to access basic necessities as winter sets in <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The provision of heavy military equipment, such as the Challenger 2 tanks from the UK, could potentially escalate the conflict, leading to more casualties and further suffering among the local population <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the capture of Soledar by Russian forces, while not a turning point in the war, could lead to increased military operations in the area, posing additional risks to the safety and well-being of civilians <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The ongoing conflict in Soledar and the surrounding areas has resulted in severe consequences for the civilian population, with relentless battles and street fighting posing a significant threat to those who remain <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The Russian scorched-earth tactics, involving the use of all kinds of weapons, have led to the destruction of Ukrainian cities and civilian deaths, as well as suffering due to the war being waged without rules <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The continuous bombardment and potential encirclement of Bakhmut, if Soledar falls, could further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis, with civilians trapped and facing intensified hostilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In the long term, the civilian population of Soledar and nearby regions may face a worsening global food crisis, as the war's impact on Ukraine's infrastructure makes it increasingly difficult to provide essential supplies during the winter season <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The loss of trust in societal institutions due to the spread of conspiracy theories and anti-state messages, as well as the potential threats to life and constitutional stability, could undermine the region's social fabric and governance structures for years to come <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the area's strategic insignificance suggests that even if control changes hands, the overall trajectory of the war may not shift, potentially leading to a prolonged conflict with continued civilian casualties and disruption of normal life <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

The pledge saw a swift reaction from Russia which warned it would only "intensify" the conflict. "Bringing tanks to the conflict zone, far from drawing the hostilities to a close, will only serve to intensify combat operations, generating more casualties, including among the civilian population," the Russian embassy in London said. Sunak said the tanks were a sign of the U.K.'s "ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine", according to a readout of a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.|

After the Russian retreat from Kherson in the south, the focus of the war moved east through the winter to waves of Russian attacks and artillery battles against Ukrainian positions. The capture of Soledar would serve a military purpose while not constituting a turning point in the war, analysts said. It could also fulfil a personal goal of bolstering Prigozhins growing reputation.|

She also warned of an increased spread "of conspiracy theories and anti-state messages, which in the long run risks undermining trust in societys institutions, politicians decision-making and the states legitimacy". She added: Both the threat of assassination and the threat to our constitution can arise in broad extremism.|

"The Russian army is reducing Ukrainian cities to rubble using all kinds of weapons in their scorched-earth tactics," Kyrylenko said in televised remarks. "Russia is waging a war without rules, resulting in civilian deaths and suffering." Wounded soldiers arrive around the clock for emergency treatment at a Ukrainian medical stabilization center near the front line around Bakhmut.|

The United States Kyivs foremost ally has said a Russian victory in Soledar or even Bakhmut, a city 10 times larger where the Russians have so far been repelled, would mean little for the overall trajectory of the war. "Even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, its not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself, and it certainly isnt going to stop the Ukrainians or slow them down," John Kirby, spokesperson for the US National Security Council, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. The Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank in Washington, DC also said the towns fall would not be "an operationally significant development and is unlikely to presage an imminent Russian encirclement of Bakhmut".|

Seizing nearby Soledar, a town about 15km (six miles) away, would help Moscows forces encircle Bakhmut and attack from a new direction in the north. Conflicting reports make the situation in Soledar unclear, as Russian officials say the town has been captured, while Ukraines leadership says fierce fighting is continuing. Described as one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war, Moscows capture of Soledar would be a significant victory following substantial battlefield setbacks throughout the second half of 2022.|

The capture of Soledar would represent a symbolic if not an especially strategic win for Putin after a long string of military setbacks dating back to last summer. But it does not suggest a significant capitulation of Ukrainian forces, nor a substantial change to the overall complexion of the war. Ukraines armed forces have denied Moscows claim.|

Russia said the capture of Soledar was"important for the continuation of successful offensive operations in the Donetsk region." It added that "establishing control over Soledar makes it possible to cut off the supply routes for Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut." The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal.|
