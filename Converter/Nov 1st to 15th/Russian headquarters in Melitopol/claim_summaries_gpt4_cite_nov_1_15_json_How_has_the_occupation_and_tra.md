The occupation of Melitopol by Russian forces has significantly impacted the city, transforming it into a "huge military base" and restricting civilian access, particularly in the area of the Melitopol airfield <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The heightened military presence and fortification have made it extremely difficult for civilians to leave the city, with the only available route seeing a drastic reduction in the number of people able to escape daily <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The city's infrastructure has also suffered due to the conflict, as evidenced by the destruction of an ammunition dump by a Himars rocket <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the overall onslaught of attacks by Russian forces on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, including energy facilities owned by DTEK Group, has compounded the suffering of the civilian population and the degradation of essential services <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The occupation of Melitopol by Russian forces has led to significant changes in the city's dynamics, transforming it into a substantial military stronghold. Mayor Ivan Fedorov has reported that the area around the Melitopol airfield has been restricted, prohibiting civilians from approaching it, and the city has been fortified with defensive structures, indicating a heavy military presence <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The Russian military has settled into local homes, schools, and kindergartens, and military equipment is now stationed within residential areas, showing a deep integration of military and civilian spaces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Efforts to exit the city are greatly hindered, with the only available route through Vasylivka allowing a mere fraction of the number of people to leave compared to previous figures <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The occupation has also had a detrimental impact on the cityâ€™s infrastructure, with reports of attacks on civilian energy and water facilities by Russia, specifically targeting a Ukrainian company, DTEK Group, that owns coal and thermal power plants in various parts of Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The strategic importance of Melitopol is underscored by the use of Himars rockets by Ukrainian forces to target military sites in the city, which has been subjected to regular attacks, disrupting the Russian military's operations and supply chains <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The ongoing conflict and occupation have not only altered the physical landscape of Melitopol but have inevitably affected the daily lives of its residents, with restricted movement and the threat of military action looming over the civilian population <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.
