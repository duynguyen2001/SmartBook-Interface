<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The shipment of advanced precision-guided missiles from Iran to Russia could provide the Kremlin with a significant boost on the battlefield by enabling more effective strikes against Ukrainian targets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. However, analysts argue that despite their potential impact on civilian infrastructure and individual military units, these drones may not reverse Russia's territorial losses or alter the course of the war <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
Iran's preparation to send around 1,000 weapons to Russia, including surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles and additional attack drones, marks a potential escalation in the Ukraine-Russia conflict by providing Russia with advanced precision-guided missiles for the first time <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Although the last shipment of about 450 drones from Iran has been used effectively by Russia, conflict analysts believe that these drones alone are unlikely to change the outcome of the war given Russia's challenges in making significant territorial gains <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, the inclusion of precision-guided missiles could offer a substantial boost to Russia on the battlefield <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This move by Iran to support Russia's military efforts may also have broader strategic implications, potentially leading to a reciprocal exchange of military assets between the two nations and influencing the attention the West pays to Middle Eastern dynamics <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Iran is preparing to send a shipment of approximately 1,000 weapons to Russia, including advanced precision-guided missiles and additional attack drones, which marks the first instance of Iran providing such advanced weaponry to Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. This move could potentially give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield in its ongoing war against Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The previous shipment from Iran included about 450 drones that have already been used with deadly effectiveness by Russia in Ukraine, demonstrating the impact of Iranian weapon supplies on the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>However, despite the potential increase in firepower for Russia, conflict analysts are skeptical that these drones and missiles will be a game-changer in the war. They argue that while the precision strikes against civilian infrastructure and individual units are damaging, they are unlikely to reverse the territorial losses that Russia has suffered since the Kharkiv offensive <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Additionally, the United States and its allies are closely monitoring the situation, with the U.S. intelligence having previously predicted the supply of drones and now warning of the missile shipments, indicating a heightened awareness and potential countermeasures against the escalating involvement of Iran in the war <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Still, conflict analysts say, the drones themselves are not likely to turn the tide of the war for Russia, which has struggled to make significant territorial gains for months now and has been pushed back in many areas by Ukrainian counteroffensives.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/11/iran-drones-are-unlikely-to-help-russia-win-the-war-in-ukraine.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 11th, 2022</div></div>| The apparent support for Russia further isolates Iran from the international community, which has condemned its violent crackdown against a female-led protest movement, sparked by the death of 22-year old Mahsa Amini while in police custody. A game-changer? Still, conflict analysts say, the drones themselves are not likely to turn the tide of the war for Russia, which has struggled to make significant territorial gains for months now and has been pushed back in many areas by Ukrainian counteroffensives. "Overall, [the drones] are not a game changer because while they can carry out precision strikes against civilian infrastructure and individual units, they can't reverse the loss of territory that Russia has been enduring since the Kharkiv offensive," Bohl said.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Iran may soon arm Russia with surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles, three U.S. and Western government officials said, in what would be significant escalation of Iranian support for President Vladimir Putins war in Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-may-preparing-arm-russia-short-range-ballistic-missiles-rcna55101" target="_blank">NBC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Iran may soon arm Russia with surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles, three U.S. and Western government officials said, in what would be significant escalation of Iranian support for President Vladimir Putins war in Ukraine. In recent weeks, the United States and at least one allied nation have observed indications that Iran is preparing to transfer the weapons, the officials said, although its unclear how close Iran is to sending them.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> While by fuelling the crisis in Ukraine, Iran likely hopes to lead the US to continue diverting its attention from the Middle East, "ironically, Tehrans support for Russias war in Ukraine could prompt the West to pay more, not less, attention to the Middle East, especially if Europe now embraces a tougher line toward Iran", note the analysts.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.intellinews.com/iran-for-first-time-involved-in-major-war-on-european-continent-conclude-analysts-261206/?source=iran" target="_blank">intellinews.com</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| "Viewed in this context, a deal to supply Russia with drones, missiles, and military advisors makes strategic sense for Iran and can demonstrate the latters value to one of its two senior partners in the anti-Western entente," add Hardie and Taleblu. Turning to the question of what, militarily, Iran may receive in return, the analysts suggest advanced Russian fighter aircraft or the S-400 air defence system, which Moscow has previously declined to sell to Tehran, could now be offered. While by fuelling the crisis in Ukraine, Iran likely hopes to lead the US to continue diverting its attention from the Middle East, "ironically, Tehrans support for Russias war in Ukraine could prompt the West to pay more, not less, attention to the Middle East, especially if Europe now embraces a tougher line toward Iran", note the analysts. Washington, they conclude, should work to ensure its Israeli and Arab allies, "who have for years lived on the front lines of the Iranian drone and missile threat, have the military capabilities and support they need to counter Irans aggression".|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> This would create vulnerabilities in other theatres to Russia in Europe, Iran in the Middle East, and North Korea on the Peninsula.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/unherd-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://unherd.com/2022/11/how-america-can-save-taiwan/" target="_blank">UnHerd</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 9th, 2022</div></div>| If the United States were locked in a desperate and uncertain fight over the worlds most important economic area (Asia) against its only peer rival (China), how could it sensibly keep forces locked up elsewhere rather than dedicate them to the main struggle? Iran, North Korea and even Russia pale in comparison to Chinas power so the United States would, rationally speaking, need to ensure it won the "biggest battle in the decisive theater", as Churchill put it. This would create vulnerabilities in other theatres to Russia in Europe, Iran in the Middle East, and North Korea on the Peninsula. And such vulnerabilities could be lasting, whether because US systems had been depleted or because the United States needed to keep those forces in Asia, either in the context of a protracted war or to hold the line following the end of a conflict with China that had bloodied the American military.|

Iran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles and more attack drones, to Russia, officials from a Western country that closely monitors Iran's weapons program told CNN on Tuesday. The shipment is being closely monitored because it would be the first instance of Iran sending advanced precision-guided missiles to Russia, which could give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield. The last shipment of weapons from Iran to Russia included about 450 drones, officials said, which the Russians have already used to deadly effect in Ukraine.|

As a result, a potential breakout capacity should be more of a fear for Russia than for the United States, making the prospect of a Russian breakout unlikely. Additionally, even though a significant upload would accelerate the arms race, it may not necessarily affect strategic stability between the United States and Russia. In 2012, a joint report by the Department of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence to Congress noted that: "The Russian Federation .|

While US intelligence, having correctly predicted the supply of drones in the summer, now warns that Iran could also deliver ballistic missiles to help Russia to replenish its rapidly depleting stock. That would further escalate Irans engagement in the war and increase pressure to counteract it. Tehran remains unfazed in the face of this mounting outrage.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> U.S. officials believe the shipments, with drones Russia has acquired from Iran, show that the grinding war and Western sanctions have sapped Russias arsenals and ability to produce new weapons.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/defense-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2022/11/02/north-korea-covertly-shipping-artillery-to-russia-says-white-house/" target="_blank">Defense News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 2nd, 2022</div></div>| John Kirby said North Korea is "trying to make it appear as though theyre being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa." He declined to provide a specific estimate on the quantity of ammunition being sent to bolster the Russian effort, but noted the U.S. doesnt believe "they are in such a quantity that the would change the momentum of the war." U.S. officials believe the shipments, with drones Russia has acquired from Iran, show that the grinding war and Western sanctions have sapped Russias arsenals and ability to produce new weapons. "As [Russian President Vladimir Putin] continues to lose ground, lose soldiers, to lose momentum, hes reaching beyond his borders," Kirby said.|
