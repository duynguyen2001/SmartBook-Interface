Power outages in Ukraine, caused by the destruction of over 30% of the country's energy power stations due to Russian attacks, have led to emergency electricity restrictions and increased operational costs for businesses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These disruptions have compounded the financial strain on businesses, as they are unable to pass on the higher costs to consumers due to the already worsened economic situation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The Ukrainian economy is projected to contract significantly, with estimates of a 40% or more reduction in size this year due to the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The recovery prospects are further challenged by the need for urgent repairs to the damaged energy infrastructure, which relies heavily on international donations of equipment <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.

The Ukrainian economy is under severe pressure due to the ongoing conflict, which has resulted in extensive damage to the country's energy infrastructure. The destruction of over 30% of Ukraine's power stations since October 10 has led to massive blackouts across the country, greatly impacting businesses and citizens alike <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The national energy company Ukrenergo has implemented emergency power outages and restrictions to limit electricity use, further disrupting economic activities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. As businesses like that of Pogulay face increased costs from using generators without the ability to raise prices due to the deteriorating economic situation, the World Bank predicts that Ukraine's economy may contract by 40% or more this year <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The targeted attacks on energy infrastructure have compounded the challenges faced by Ukraine, with the capital city experiencing 1.5 times more households without power compared to recent days, leading to appeals for electricity conservation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In light of these disruptions, Ukraine's recovery prospects post-conflict are contingent upon repairing the damaged energy sector. The success of these repair efforts hinge on extensive donations of equipment, with the Energy Community Secretariat and other international partners like the G7 mobilizing to provide the necessary assistance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The EU is also contributing by seeking to ensure energy security and diversify natural gas supplies while reducing demand for natural gas, in alignment with its RePowerEU plan <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. However, despite the support, the Ukrainian government has stressed that the country's recovery will not be complete without a sense of justice for the victims of the conflict, adding a layer of complexity to the post-conflict economic landscape <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> While the twin crises of COVID and Ukraine have muddled the picture, most economists agree Brexit has already had a significant impact on the U.K. economy.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/britain-uk-europe-brexit-wrong/" target="_blank">politico.eu</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 3rd, 2022</div></div>| With no pre-agreed model of what Brexit should actually entail, the U.K.s future relationship with the EU became the subject of heated and protracted debate. After years of wrangling, Britain finally left the bloc at the end of January 2020, severing ties in a more profound way than many had envisaged. While the twin crises of COVID and Ukraine have muddled the picture, most economists agree Brexit has already had a significant impact on the U.K. economy. The size of Britains trade flows relative to GDP has fallen further than other G7 countries, business investment growth trails the likes of Japan, South Korea and Italy, and the OBR has stuck by its March 2020 prediction that Brexit would reduce productivity and U.K. GDP by 4 percent.|

Russia aims to fracture the energy grid and leave millions without power, water, or heat, in an attempt to reduce Ukraines resilience and determination during the cold winter months. The Government of Ukraine will need assistance to ensure Ukraine remains resilient and strong despite Russias efforts to cut off heat and light this winter.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> With winter approaching, Ukraine is also bracing for increased challenges in civilian energy as damage to infrastructure has caused widespread outages and the need for scheduled blackouts to stabilize power systems.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/07/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 7th, 2022</div></div>| The EU is also seeking to introduce measures to ensure energy security and diversify natural gas supplies while reducing demand for natural gas ahead of winter, in line with its RePowerEU plan, according to the read-out. By shifting demand for natural gas, the U.S. and EU hope to both accelerate the clean energy transition and curtail Russian energy revenues, "which are used to fund the unprovoked and unjustified war," according to the statement. With winter approaching, Ukraine is also bracing for increased challenges in civilian energy as damage to infrastructure has caused widespread outages and the need for scheduled blackouts to stabilize power systems. The U.S. and EU have provided and will continue to provide emergency energy assistance to Ukraine and surrounding regions heavily impacted by Russia's attacks on energy, per the statement.|

Later in the day, however, the company released an update saying that scheduled outages for a specific number of hours are not enough and instead there will be emergency outages, which could last indefinitely. Ukraine has been grappling with power outages and disruption of water supplies since Russia started unleashing barrages of missile and drone attacks on the countrys energy infrastructure last month.
