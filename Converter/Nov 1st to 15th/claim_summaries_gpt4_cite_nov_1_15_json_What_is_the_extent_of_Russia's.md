<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Russia's use of Iranian-provided drones, which Iran admits were supplied before the invasion, has contributed to extensive damage to Ukraine's infrastructure, including power systems, with Iran denying knowledge of their use in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This collaboration has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, leading to widespread blackouts affecting millions and prompting G7 discussions on reinforcing Ukraine's defenses and infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in large-scale infrastructure damage, particularly to the country's energy systems, with Russian forces targeting civilian infrastructure including power plants <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Iran, despite initially denying, has admitted to supplying Russia with drones prior to the invasion, which Ukraine and its allies say are being used to carry out these attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The extent of the damage is so severe that 40 percent of Ukraine's power system has been affected, causing widespread blackouts affecting millions, including 450,000 residents in Kyiv alone <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. In response, the G7 is coordinating efforts to help Ukraine repair and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure, acknowledging the need for heightened support due to the role of Iranian-provided drones in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to massive infrastructure damage, with around 40% of Ukraine's energy systems damaged due to attacks, leaving 4.5 million people without power, including 450,000 in Kyiv alone <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This damage has been exacerbated by the use of Iranian-supplied drones and the potential future use of Iranian short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), which could further devastate Ukraine's power infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The collaboration between Iran and Russia, including Iran's acknowledgment of providing drones to Russia and the possibility of missile supplies, marks a significant escalation in the conflict and a new phase of warfare <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The G7 has responded to the infrastructure crisis by establishing a coordination mechanism to assist Ukraine in repairing and defending its critical energy and water infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, evidence of Iran's military alignment with Russia is seen in the strikes against Ukrainian cities and civilian targets, with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian admitting to a limited number of drones being supplied to Moscow, albeit claiming ignorance of their use in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This collaboration and the resulting infrastructure damage have significant consequences, not just for the war effort, but also for the civilians facing a potentially cold and dark winter <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Russias most recent invasion of Ukraine on February 24 triggered the largest conflict in Europe since World War II with devastating and enduring humanitarian and economic consequences.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/brookings-institute" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/financing-and-governing-the-recovery-reconstruction-and-modernization-of-ukraine/" target="_blank">Brookings Institution</a></div><div>*(Think Tank / Policy Group)*</div><div></div></div>| Russias most recent invasion of Ukraine on February 24 triggered the largest conflict in Europe since World War II with devastating and enduring humanitarian and economic consequences. According to the United Nations, it has forced nearly one-third of Ukrainians from their homes (dispersing 7.8 million refugees throughout Europe and displacing 6.2 million internally) and killed or injured more than 16,000 civilians.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Russia has denied that the drones it has used in Ukraine came from Iran, but the Islamic Republics foreign minister on Saturday for the first time acknowledged supplying Moscow with "a limited number" of drones before the invasion.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-suffers-power-outages-intense-russian-attacks-rcna55855" target="_blank">NBC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Ukraines state electricity operator on Saturday announced blackouts in Kyiv and seven other regions of the country in the aftermath of Russias devastating strikes on energy infrastructure. The move comes as Russian forces continue to pound Ukrainian cities and villages with missiles and drones, inflicting damage on power plants, water supplies and other civilian targets, in a grinding war that is nearing its nine-month mark. Russia has denied that the drones it has used in Ukraine came from Iran, but the Islamic Republics foreign minister on Saturday for the first time acknowledged supplying Moscow with "a limited number" of drones before the invasion. Hossein Amirabdollahian claimed, however, that Tehran didnt know if its drones were used against Ukraine and stated Irans commitment to stopping the conflict.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Russia has been bombing and destroying civilian infrastructure, ushering in fears of a cold, dark winter.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-11-03-22/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 3rd, 2022</div></div>| About 4.5 million Ukrainian consumers are dealing with power outages Thursday evening, according to President Volodymr Zelensky. Households across the country have been temporarily disconnected from energy supply under an emergency schedule aimed at stabilizing the nation's fragile electric grid. Russia has been bombing and destroying civilian infrastructure, ushering in fears of a cold, dark winter. Most people are affected in the capital, Kyiv, and nine other regions: Dnipropetrovsk, Zhytomyr, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Kirovohrad, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Khmelnytskyi, Cherkasy.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Once the connection was reestablished, Kuleba finished updating the countries on the extensive damage done to Ukraines infrastructure by Iranian-provided drones and appealed for more global support and pressure on Russia.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/11/04/g7-russia-ukraine-critical-infrastructure/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 4th, 2022</div></div>| The meetings of ministers from the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Canada and Italy also included discussions on providing Ukraine sophisticated air defense systems to fend off volleys of Russian missile and drone strikes, officials said. The decision to fortify Ukraines infrastructure followed a remote video briefing from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Thursday that was disrupted by a blackout due to chronic energy shortages. Once the connection was reestablished, Kuleba finished updating the countries on the extensive damage done to Ukraines infrastructure by Iranian-provided drones and appealed for more global support and pressure on Russia. Forty percent of Ukraines power system has been damaged by Russian attacks that have left 4.5 million people throughout the country without power, including 450,000 residents in Kyiv.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Iran's deepening military alignment with Moscow over the war as well as China's growing assertiveness topped the agenda of the G7 meeting.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/g7-agreed-need-coordination-mechanism-repair-ukraine-infrastructure-2022-11-04/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 4th, 2022</div></div>| "We will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes," the foreign ministers of the wealthiest democracies said after a two-day meeting in the western German town of Muenster. "Today we establish a G7 coordination mechanism to help Ukraine repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure," their statement said. Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Iran's deepening military alignment with Moscow over the war as well as China's growing assertiveness topped the agenda of the G7 meeting. The coordinating mechanism would be the core focus of the group in the days and weeks ahead, a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters on condition of anonymity.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> No matter what, like the delivery of Iran's Shahed-136 suicide drones before them, these missiles use will mark a new phase of a war that so far has no end in sight and the devastation they could bring may change the calculus of the conflict on all sides.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/an-iranian-ballistic-missile-storm-is-on-ukraines-horizon" target="_blank">thedrive.com</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 7th, 2022</div></div>| With the supposed timeline of delivery of Iranian SRBMs to Russia winding down, it's very likely we will see these weapons in action in the relatively near future. If they decimate Ukraine's power infrastructure, calls for more advanced anti-ballistic missile capable air defenses will grow very loud as will demands for giving Kyiv similar weapons so that such attacks do not go unchecked. No matter what, like the delivery of Iran's Shahed-136 suicide drones before them, these missiles use will mark a new phase of a war that so far has no end in sight and the devastation they could bring may change the calculus of the conflict on all sides.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> And Iran, a more significant power, now enjoys a detectably stronger relationship with Russia, with serious implications for the Middle East, nuclear non-proliferation, and sanctions evasion.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://cepa.org/article/few-friends-russia-and-iran/" target="_blank">cepa.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 14th, 2022</div></div>| Thats not to say that Russia has no friends, just that it has fewer than before its all-out war on Ukraine began in February. North Korea, for example, has reportedly drawn closer to the Kremlin through supplies of military equipment to aid its war of aggression. And Iran, a more significant power, now enjoys a detectably stronger relationship with Russia, with serious implications for the Middle East, nuclear non-proliferation, and sanctions evasion. The sight of Iranian suicide drones striking civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and the mooted arrival of Iranian ballistic missiles to bolster Russias unprovoked war on a European neighbor meanwhile shows how the Kremlin benefits (and Tehrans indifference to reputational damage.)|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The G7 has established a "coordination mechanism" to help Ukraine "repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure," the group's foreign ministers said in a joint statement on Friday following meetings in Mnster.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-11-04-22/h_c385d6702ae33392504bd3ccdb00d096" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 4th, 2022</div></div>| The G7 has established a "coordination mechanism" to help Ukraine "repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure," the group's foreign ministers said in a joint statement on Friday following meetings in Mnster. The statement condemned Russia's attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, "in particular energy and water facilities" in Ukraine.|

Images emerged on Friday of the main river crossing - the Antonivsky Bridge - having partially collapsed. It remains unclear how the damage was caused. On Saturday morning, other images emerged showing damage to the Nova Kakhovka dam, some 58km (36 miles) north-east of Kherson city.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that around 40% of the country's energy infrastructure has been seriously damaged.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/power-cuts-another-worry-ukraines-critically-ill-2022-11-10/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Nov 10th, 2022</div></div>| "It's a war and there's nothing we can do about it," 65-year-old Halytska said from her hospital bed. Russia stepped up attacks on power plants, substations and other targets in mid-October amid numerous battlefield setbacks following its Feb. 24 invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that around 40% of the country's energy infrastructure has been seriously damaged. On Thursday, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said on television that Russia was likely stockpiling missiles and drones for future strikes.|
