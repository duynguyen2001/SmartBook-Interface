The Russian withdrawal from the city of Kherson, announced by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, represents a significant setback for Russia and is seen as a humiliating blow to President Vladimir Putin, particularly after the recent annexation declaration <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This retreat may have broader implications for the morale of Russian forces and the security of other Russian-held territories in Ukraine, as it indicates a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive and difficulties in maintaining supply lines for the Russian military <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The loss of Kherson, the only regional capital captured by Russia since the beginning of the war, is considered Russia's "biggest setback of the war" and raises questions about the stability of Russian control in the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Ukraine remains cautious about the Russian forces' intentions, suggesting a level of uncertainty that continues to impact the security situation in the occupied areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

The Russian withdrawal from Kherson, as ordered by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, marks a significant military and political setback, with broad implications for the security of the remaining Russian-held territories in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. This retreat from the only regional capital that Russia had captured since its February invasion represents not only a strategic loss but also a potential blow to the morale of Russian forces and a political humiliation for President Vladimir Putin, particularly after his declaration of the annexation of Kherson and other regions as Russian territory "forever" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The withdrawal suggests that Ukrainian forces could gain a strategic advantage, potentially using the west bank of the Dnipro as a springboard for future offensives, including towards Crimea, which is a long-term objective for Kyiv <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the retreat could signal a shift in the dynamics of the conflict, as it might end Russian efforts to establish a land bridge between Crimea and the Russian mainland or link Crimea to Odessa. This raises questions about the security and sustainability of Russia's strategic aims in the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Additionally, the withdrawal could have repercussions for the remaining Russian-held territories in Ukraine, as it suggests that Russian forces might be vulnerable to further Ukrainian counteroffensives. Military experts and analysts anticipate that the war is far from over, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces expected to continue fighting through the winter, which could lead to additional territorial changes and challenges to the security of Russian-controlled areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> The decision, Russian officials said, was taken to save the lives of Russian soldiers in the face of a Ukrainian counteroffensive and difficulties to keep supply lines to the strategic city open.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/10/russia-withdrawal-from-ukraines-kherson-explained-in-maps" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 10th, 2022</div></div>| Russian troops have been ordered to withdraw from the only Ukrainian regional capital seized throughout the war.

Were Kherson to fall in the counteroffensive, the experts added, it would also be a political humiliation for Putin, as Kherson is one of four partially occupied regions of Ukraine that he announced would be part of Russia "forever" with great fanfare September 30. "It would be a massive blow, primarily politically," said Philip Ingram, a retired senior British military intelligence officer.|
