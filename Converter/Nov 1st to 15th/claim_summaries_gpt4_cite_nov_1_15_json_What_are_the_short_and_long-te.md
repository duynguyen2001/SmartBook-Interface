Civilians in Ukraine are increasingly fearful as Moscow's attacks on critical infrastructure lead to widespread power outages, with concerns growing over the implications of a dark and cold winter <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. President Zelenskyy has indicated that over 30% of Ukraine's energy power stations have been destroyed since October 10, causing massive blackouts and eliminating the possibility of negotiations with Putin's regime <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This sustained targeting of energy infrastructure has not only immediate humanitarian impacts but may also have long-term consequences on civilian morale and resistance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. If power outages persist, they could lead to a decline in support for the government and potentially foster a crisis akin to what has been seen in countries like Venezuela, marked by increased crime and investment risks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The sustained attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure have resulted in significant power outages, contributing to a decline in civilian morale as the country faces a potentially dark and cold winter. The destruction of over 30% of Ukraine's power stations since October 10 has caused widespread blackouts and increased the hardships for residents, with many experiencing daily power cuts lasting up to four hours <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The situation is worsened by the fact that the power outages are often unscheduled, disrupting civilians' ability to plan and carry out everyday activities, as exemplified by the difficulties faced by citizens like the 70-year-old pensioner waiting for supplies and a hairdresser unable to work efficiently <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>In the long term, the power outages could lead to a severe decline in resilience and determination among Ukrainians. With the Russian military's strategy to fracture the energy grid and subject millions to harsh winter conditions without power, water, or heat, the potential for a decrease in Ukrainian resistance is a serious concern <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. This strategy not only affects the immediate living conditions but could also have catastrophic implications for Ukraine's economy and political stability, as energy shortages could hamper both civilian life and the functioning of critical infrastructure. The international community, through the G7, has recognized the urgency of the situation and is coordinating efforts to provide equipment and assistance to maintain and fortify Ukraine's energy sector, recognizing the importance of sustained morale and resistance in the face of adversity <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
