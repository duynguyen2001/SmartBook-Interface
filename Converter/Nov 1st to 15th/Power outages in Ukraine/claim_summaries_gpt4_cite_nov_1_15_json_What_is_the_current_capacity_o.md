## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Ukraine's power grid has been significantly compromised with over 30% of its energy power stations destroyed since October 10, leading to widespread blackouts and a struggle to maintain electricity and heating generation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Efforts to restore power and water supply are underway, with plans to save electricity, increase the work of thermal plants, import electricity, and accelerate repairs, despite difficulties in confirming the success of these measures due to reported damage and attacks on infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The state electricity operator announced blackouts in Kyiv and seven other regions following devastating strikes on the energy infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Despite having over 14 billion cubic meters of gas in storage, the general gas supply crunch in Europe, exacerbated by Russian curtailments, means that Ukraine needs to conserve fuel to ensure sufficient volumes for next year, complicating the prospects for energy generation and heating <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. However, the Ukrainian authorities are exploring various measures to address the crisis, including conserving electricity, increasing thermal plant output, importing electricity, and accelerating repair works to restore power and water supply, even in regions like Kherson that have experienced damage from alleged attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The Ukrainian power grid has been severely compromised due to persistent Russian strikes, with President Zelenskyy noting that over 30% of Ukraine's energy stations have been destroyed since October 10, significantly impacting the nation's power supply <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. As a result, emergency blackouts have been implemented in Kyiv and other regions, and the state electricity operator Ukrenergo has been forced to introduce power outages and restrictions to manage the balance of the power system amid ongoing attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The destruction of the energy infrastructure has left millions intermittently without electricity and water, exacerbating the hardships for civilians as winter approaches <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Despite the substantial damage, Ukraine is exploring several options to manage and restore its power capabilities. These include conserving large amounts of electricity, utilizing thermal plants more intensively, importing electricity, and accelerating repair efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. With over 14 billion cubic meters of gas in storage, normally sufficient for winter needs, Ukraine must conserve fuel to maintain adequate supplies for the coming year, especially considering the general gas shortage in Europe <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Repair and restoration work continues around the clock, indicating a concerted effort to mitigate the damages and restore the power grid as swiftly as possible <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. However, the restoration timeline remains uncertain, as exemplified by the situation in Kherson where it's unclear when electricity will be fully restored after the Russian forces destroyed all critical infrastructure before their withdrawal <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

The move comes as Russian forces continue to pound Ukrainian cities and villages with missiles and drones, inflicting damage on power plants and water supplies, in a grinding war that is nearing its nine-month mark.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="2"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Right now, Ukraine has over 14 billion cubic meters of gas in storage, which would normally be enough to support gas-fired electricity and heating generation this winter.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/ukraine-needs-urgent-help-to-counter-putins-energy-infrastructure-attacks/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 14th, 2022</div></div>| Ukraine has a number of options as the country looks to address Russias infrastructure bombing campaign. These include saving electricity in large quantities, ramping up the work of thermal plants, importing electricity, and speeding up repair works. Right now, Ukraine has over 14 billion cubic meters of gas in storage, which would normally be enough to support gas-fired electricity and heating generation this winter. However, with a general gas supply crunch in Europe following widespread Russian curtailments, fuel would need to be saved to ensure Ukraine has sufficient volumes next year.|

Another kind of Russian terrorist attacks: targeting energy & critical infrastructure. Since Oct 10, 30% of Ukraines power stations have been destroyed, causing massive blackouts across the country. No space left for negotiations with Putin's regime.|

It added that "three reinforced concrete columns of high-voltage power lines were damaged" after what it claimed was "a terrorist attack organized by the Ukrainian side." The Russian-backed Kherson region administration said that "power and water supply will be restored throughout the Kherson region in the very near future," asking citizens to remain calm. CNN cannot independently confirm or verify details of the claimed attack or who was behind it.|

Simply put, these weapons will be very challenging if not impossible for Ukraine to defend against, they pack a major punch, and they can strike nearly anywhere in the country, putting Ukraine's already battered energy infrastructure, in particular, at extreme risk. While the unsettling truth here is that Ukraine will have very little means of defending its electricity infrastructure, and other targets for that matter, from attacks by imported Iranian ballistic missiles, Russia's dwindling stockpile of cruise missiles, as well as Iranian-provided drones, have already taken their toll on the country's energy ecosystem. But Ukraine's defenses against these 'air breathing' weapons have been improving and they are now on the precipice of making a major capability leap.|

Ukraine has been facing a wide assault on critical infrastructure and power sources since early October. This week alone, Russian attacks on critical infrastructure in the regions of Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia have left millions without electricity and water intermittently.|

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that "before fleeing from Kherson, the occupiers destroyed all critical infrastructure - communications, supply of water, heat, electricity". It is not yet clear when electricity will be restored to the city - nearby areas are expected to get it back in a few days' time. The power cuts prevented Kherson's bakeries from making bread.|

Kherson is one of four regions that Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed last month. Russian state-owned news agency TASS quoted Khersons Moscow-appointed governor Vladimir Saldo as saying that there were plans for the citys power supply to be restored by the end of the day. Energy specialists were working to "quickly" resolve the issue, the Russian-backed authorities said as they called on people to "remain calm".|
