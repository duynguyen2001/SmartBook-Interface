<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Iran is supplying drones to Russia, which Moscow is increasingly reliant on due to its own military production shortcomings, using them to carry out systematic attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This collaboration is bolstering Russia's military capabilities in its war against Ukraine and has implications for Middle Eastern geopolitics and nuclear non-proliferation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
Russia's reliance on Iran for drones due to its own military deficiencies has been a significant factor in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with Iranian combat drones being used to target Ukrainian civilian infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The partnership between Russia and Iran has strengthened as a result of Western sanctions imposed on both countries, leading to Iran supplying military equipment, including the potential delivery of ballistic missiles, to support Russia's war efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This collaboration has not only facilitated Russia's systematic airstrike campaign on Ukraine's power infrastructure but also highlights Iran's disregard for reputational damage as it aids Russia's aggression in Europe <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The impact of this alliance is evident in the increased risk of a humanitarian disaster in Ukraine, with millions potentially affected by the destruction of essential services <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The collaboration between Iran and Russia has significantly contributed to the latter's military operations in Ukraine, particularly through the supply of drones and military equipment. Iran's combat drones have become a crucial element in Russia's strategy, targeting Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and thus raising the specter of a humanitarian disaster. Iranian-made drones have been systematically used to attack energy infrastructure, a campaign that has been methodically planned to exploit Ukraine's vulnerabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Moreover, this partnership has extended to include the presence of Iranian military personnel in Crimea, aiding Russian forces directly <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The relationship has flourished amid Russia's search for allies to circumvent Western sanctions, with Iran emerging as a key partner in this regard <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The impact of the Iran-Russia collaboration is multifaceted, influencing not only the conflict in Ukraine but also wider geopolitical dynamics. The use of Iranian drones and the potential introduction of Iranian ballistic missiles pose a new threat that could herald a new phase in the war, potentially altering the conflict's calculus <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This partnership has also affected international diplomacy, with Ukraine calling for punitive measures against Iran for its support of Russia's aggression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, the sale of drones to Russia is seen as a violation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal by Western signatories, further complicating diplomatic relations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Additionally, Iran's growing role as a drone-exporting nation has implications beyond the immediate conflict, creating new tensions in various geopolitical axes, including a response from Israeli forces targeting Iranian drone capabilities in Syria <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

Were also working together to impose sanctions on those supporting President Putins war. That includes Iran, whose combat drones are killing Ukrainian civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure, and whose personnel in Crimea are assisting Russia in carrying out these brutal attacks. The G7 is also providing economic and humanitarian support to Ukraine as President Putin tries to make up for Russias defeats on the battlefield by targeting civilian infrastructure that provides Ukrainian men, women, children, and elderly people with heat, water, and electricity.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> With the war now in its ninth month, chronic supply problems mean that Russia is now increasingly reliant on Iran for drones that it is unable to produce itself.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putins-failing-ukraine-invasion-proves-russia-is-no-superpower/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 1st, 2022</div></div>| Chronic corruption within the Russian Ministry of Defense has hampered military logistics, with soldiers in many instances receiving kit dating from the 1970s or earlier. It has also become painfully obvious that many of the vehicles and weapons listed as part of the vast Russian arsenal exist on paper only. With the war now in its ninth month, chronic supply problems mean that Russia is now increasingly reliant on Iran for drones that it is unable to produce itself. These shortcomings have highlighted the cosmetic nature of the much-vaunted military reforms carried out by Russia over the past two decades.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> And Iran, a more significant power, now enjoys a detectably stronger relationship with Russia, with serious implications for the Middle East, nuclear non-proliferation, and sanctions evasion.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://cepa.org/article/few-friends-russia-and-iran/" target="_blank">cepa.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 14th, 2022</div></div>| Thats not to say that Russia has no friends, just that it has fewer than before its all-out war on Ukraine began in February. North Korea, for example, has reportedly drawn closer to the Kremlin through supplies of military equipment to aid its war of aggression. And Iran, a more significant power, now enjoys a detectably stronger relationship with Russia, with serious implications for the Middle East, nuclear non-proliferation, and sanctions evasion. The sight of Iranian suicide drones striking civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and the mooted arrival of Iranian ballistic missiles to bolster Russias unprovoked war on a European neighbor meanwhile shows how the Kremlin benefits (and Tehrans indifference to reputational damage.)|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> This bombing campaign is systematic in nature and appears to have been planned with the help of Russian technical experts who have a good understanding of Ukraines electricity infrastructure and weaknesses.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/ukraine-needs-urgent-help-to-counter-putins-energy-infrastructure-attacks/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 14th, 2022</div></div>| Russias airstrike campaign to methodically destroy Ukraines civilian infrastructure is raising fears of a humanitarian disaster with tens of millions potentially at risk. Since early October, Russia has launched hundreds of missiles and kamikaze drones at key infrastructure targets including Ukrainian power plants, large substations which facilitate the flow of electricity to consumers, high-voltage transmission lines, and distribution lines across the country. This bombing campaign is systematic in nature and appears to have been planned with the help of Russian technical experts who have a good understanding of Ukraines electricity infrastructure and weaknesses. The clear goal of the attacks is to prevent generators from delivering electricity to the power system and, in particular, to damage and destroy high voltage networks.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Since the start of the war in Ukraine, relations between Russia and Iran have flourished.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/11/05/comrades-in-sanctions-can-iran-help-russia-weather-the-economic-storm-a79295" target="_blank">themoscowtimes.com</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 5th, 2022</div></div>| Since the start of the war in Ukraine, relations between Russia and Iran have flourished. Having been hit by a new raft of tough Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow set about looking for alternative partners among other traditionally anti-Western countries including to bypass trade restrictions and Iran looks set to be one of the most promising.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The Russians have reportedly been using Iran-made drones to conduct strikes in Ukraine, and Iranian military officers are on the ground in Crimea, according to John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications at the White House.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/huffpost-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/russia-ukraine-war-end_n_636273b8e4b045895a986051" target="_blank">HuffPost</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 7th, 2022</div></div>| What Other Tactics Is Moscow Using To Pressure Ukraine Into Defeat? Russia has also struck a close relationship with Iran in recent months. The Russians have reportedly been using Iran-made drones to conduct strikes in Ukraine, and Iranian military officers are on the ground in Crimea, according to John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications at the White House. Zelenskyy on Sunday said Iranian drones have been crucial to Russias efforts of attacking energy infrastructure and called for Iran to be punished for lending its support to Moscow.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Anti-ship missiles, anti-tank weapons, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, drones, long-range artillery, and small arms could wreak havoc on an invading force, and disrupt the supply chains necessary to sustain an occupation.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/atlantic" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/12/china-takeover-taiwan-xi-tsai-ing-wen/671895/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 7th, 2022</div></div>| This entails denying China the ability to control the battle space. The Chinese havent fought a war in several decades, and Taiwan has geographic advantagesincluding ample mountains and few beaches suitable for amphibious operations. Anti-ship missiles, anti-tank weapons, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, drones, long-range artillery, and small arms could wreak havoc on an invading force, and disrupt the supply chains necessary to sustain an occupation. Lee also argues that Taiwans civilian population should be organized into a trained Territorial Defense Force, so that any attempted occupation would be met by the broadest possible resistance.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> No matter what, like the delivery of Iran's Shahed-136 suicide drones before them, these missiles use will mark a new phase of a war that so far has no end in sight and the devastation they could bring may change the calculus of the conflict on all sides.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/an-iranian-ballistic-missile-storm-is-on-ukraines-horizon" target="_blank">thedrive.com</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 7th, 2022</div></div>| With the supposed timeline of delivery of Iranian SRBMs to Russia winding down, it's very likely we will see these weapons in action in the relatively near future. If they decimate Ukraine's power infrastructure, calls for more advanced anti-ballistic missile capable air defenses will grow very loud as will demands for giving Kyiv similar weapons so that such attacks do not go unchecked. No matter what, like the delivery of Iran's Shahed-136 suicide drones before them, these missiles use will mark a new phase of a war that so far has no end in sight and the devastation they could bring may change the calculus of the conflict on all sides.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Al Jazeeras Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said the Western signatories of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal claim the sale of drones by Iran to Russia is a violation of the agreement, which the United States withdrew from in 2018.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/5/russian-shelling-causes-power-blackouts-across-ukraine" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 5th, 2022</div></div>| Later on Saturday, Ukraine warned Iran that "the consequences of complicity" with Moscow would be "greater than the benefit". "Tehran should realise that the consequences of complicity in the crimes of the Russian Federations aggression against Ukraine will be much greater than the benefit of Russias support," foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Facebook. Al Jazeeras Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said the Western signatories of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal claim the sale of drones by Iran to Russia is a violation of the agreement, which the United States withdrew from in 2018. "Under the agreement, the Iranian government is not allowed to sell or import any advanced military equipment or technology," she said.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Iran has become a drone-exporting nation and Iranian drones are creating new flashpoints in different geopolitical axes.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://jamestown.org/program/iranian-drones-are-changing-the-battlefields-of-eurasia/" target="_blank">jamestown.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Two weeks later, Israeli forces struck an Iranian drone factory in Syria ( Al Arabiya , October 23). This demonstrated how Irans drone program is now beyond Iran, both in terms of production and operational impact. Iran has become a drone-exporting nation and Iranian drones are creating new flashpoints in different geopolitical axes. Tehrans drone program is hardly new, however.|
