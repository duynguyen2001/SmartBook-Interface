The Russian Defense Minister, Sergei Shoigu, ordered a retreat of Russian troops from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region, marking a significant withdrawal from the strategically important city of Kherson <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This decision was announced on television by both Shoigu and General Sergei Surovikin, who pointed to logistical challenges as the reason for the withdrawal, particularly in light of Ukrainian forces advancing towards Kherson from two directions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The Russian withdrawal from Kherson, the only regional capital they had captured since the invasion began in February, represents the most considerable setback for Russia since their forces were pushed back in the northern Kharkiv region in September <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The Ukrainian victory in Kherson is perceived as a substantial blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin, especially following his announcement of the annexation of Kherson along with three other regions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The retreat from Kherson is also seen as undermining the morale of Russian forces and is considered Russia's "biggest setback of the war" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials remained cautious, with some suggesting the Russian retreat might be a trick, even as the Russian-installed official in southern Ukraine signaled the impending pullback and advised civilians to evacuate <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The Russian forces completed their withdrawal from Kherson, retreating to the east side of the Dnieper River, a move that reverses their most significant military achievement since the war began and potentially alters the conditions for any future negotiations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
