<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The Russian withdrawal from Kherson, directed by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, could signal a significant shift in Moscow's military strategy as it represents one of the most substantial retreats since the invasion began <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This tactical change may involve repositioning forces to reinforce other fronts or to avoid further losses in the face of Ukrainian advances <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has ordered a withdrawal of Russian troops from the city of Kherson, signaling what could be a significant shift in military tactics <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This move follows the announcement of a retreat from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the face of Ukrainian advances and comes after a high-profile annexation ceremony led by President Vladimir Putin <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. As Russian forces empty out key institutions in Kherson and officials indicate a potential pullback, there is speculation about whether this could lead to a new defensive strategy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, Ukrainian officials remain cautious, considering the possibility that the retreat may be a ruse, implying that the shift in tactics could also involve a psychological component of misinformation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The recent order by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu for troops to retreat to the right bank of the Dnipro River suggests a significant shift in Russian military strategy concerning the war in Ukraine, particularly in the southern region, where Kherson is a strategic city <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This move, which could result in Russia relinquishing control of Kherson, is seen as a potential major setback for President Vladimir Putin, especially after the annexation of Kherson was announced in Moscow <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The withdrawal has been met with caution by Ukrainian officials, who are wary of Russian intentions and consider the possibility of a strategic regrouping or a trap rather than a genuine retreat <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>If the Russian withdrawal from Kherson is indeed genuine, it could indicate a shift in tactics to prioritizing the withdrawal of forces in an orderly fashion and delaying Ukrainian advances, rather than attempting to halt the Ukrainian counteroffensive completely <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. This could pose challenges for both retreating Russian forces and advancing Ukrainian troops, with the latter attempting to reoccupy and secure the city of Kherson and its surroundings <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The Russian-installed official's call for civilians to evacuate could also signal a new phase in the conflict, though Ukraine claims these evacuations include forced deportations, an act considered a war crime, which Russia denies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Analysts imply that the new Russian tactic may involve regrouping forces to more defensible positions while managing the optics and consequences of the withdrawal <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

"The battle of Kherson is not over, but Russian forces have entered a new phase prioritizing withdrawing their forces across the river in good order and delaying Ukrainian forces, rather than seeking to halt the Ukrainian counteroffensive entirely," analysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted Wednesday evening. The institute said the entire Russian contingent will take some time to withdraw across the Dnieper, and it's unclear whether Russian forces will be able to conduct the withdrawal in relatively good order under Ukrainian pressure. Britain's Ministry of Defense agreed that the withdrawal is likely to be fraught with difficulty, with Ukrainian forces that are trying to reoccupy and liberate the Russian-occupied part of Kherson also facing dangers in that endeavor.|
