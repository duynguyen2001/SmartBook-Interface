Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu ordered the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Ukrainian city of Kherson, which marked a significant retreat in the ongoing conflict. The reasons behind this decision included the intent to preserve the lives of Russian soldiers in the face of a strong Ukrainian counteroffensive and the recognition of logistical challenges that were being faced by the Russian military forces. The difficulties in maintaining supply lines to the city, which is strategically located on the right side of the Dnieper River, were underscored as a key factor leading to this decision <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The retreat from Kherson was also seen as a move to reposition Russian forces to more defensible locations, as the city had become increasingly difficult to supply and function effectively due to Ukrainian precision strikes on bridges, depots, and troop concentrations. This withdrawal came after Moscow had previously declared the annexation of Kherson region, making the retreat a particularly humiliating setback for President Vladimir Putin. The announcement of the pullout was made via a televised briefing, which included both Shoigu and General Sergei Surovikin, the commander in charge of leading the invasion of Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.
