It is often referred to as a weapon for terrorists, not countries, as it is designed to spread fear and panic more than eliminate any military target. There is no record of such a weapon ever being used successfully. On Monday, the UN's nuclear watchdog has said it will send safeguard inspectors to visit two nuclear locations in Ukraine at the request of authorities in Kyiv.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> But even a small nuclear explosion could cause thousands of deaths and render a base or a downtown area uninhabitable for years.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/03/us/politics/russia-tactical-nuclear-weapons.html" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Oct 3rd, 2022</div></div>| The targets could be a Ukrainian military base or a small city. How much destruction and lingering radiation would result depends on factors including the size of the weapon and the winds. But even a small nuclear explosion could cause thousands of deaths and render a base or a downtown area uninhabitable for years.|

A dirty bomb is a weapon that combines conventional explosives like dynamite and radioactive material like uranium. It is often referred to as a weapon for terrorists, not countries, as it is designed to spread fear and panic more than eliminate any military target. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly denied Moscow's accusations and Kyiv's foreign minister has invited UN inspectors to visit Ukraine to show they "have nothing to hide."|

"Bombardment is very weak efficacy, and typically only builds resolve," said Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at C.N.A., a defense research institute based in Virginia. But as Russian forces struggle on the battlefield, such strikes on infrastructure targets may allow the Kremlin to extend the war indefinitely by squeezing the Ukrainian economy and quashing any hope of a return to normalcy, a hope raised by Ukraines recent military successes. Mr. Putin is also fighting a war on two fronts, and only one of them is in Ukraine.|

The White House has said it would respond forcefully to any Russian use of nuclear weapons. Jake Sullivan, President Joe Bidens national security adviser, said that Russia would suffer "catastrophic consequences" if it crossed that line.

Towards the end of last month, Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, said there would be "catastrophic consequences" for Moscow if it sought to deploy a tactical nuclear weapon, which can have the power of six or seven Hiroshima blasts.

Now, the world awaits for yet another nuclear test at Punggye-ri underground facilities, where U.S. surveillance satellites have detected preparation activities. "If they do such a test, from our perspective, that would clearly constitute a grave escalatory action that seriously threatens regional and international security instability," Defense Department spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder told reporters at the Pentagon.

He wants the rest of the world to internalize the idea that a small nuclear attack isnt really all that different from any other kind of bombing, while still shattering the nuclear taboo, with all the anxiety that word provokes. He might see this as allowing him to use a nuclear weapon to achieve the trifecta of terrorizing the Ukrainians into surrender, holding the West at bay, and escaping the consequences of crossing the military worlds brightest red line. Putin has played the same game with other breaches of international norms.|

Associate professor Andrei Sidorov, dean of the Faculty of World Politics at Moscow State University, wants to trigger a new surge of war victims fleeing into the EU and Britain. Further missile attacks aimed at civilian infrastructure, as Putin ordered this week, could lead to a new exodus from Ukraine - similar to that of the start of the war in February. Dr Sidorov is suggesting using it as a weapon of war, tantamount to genocide.|
