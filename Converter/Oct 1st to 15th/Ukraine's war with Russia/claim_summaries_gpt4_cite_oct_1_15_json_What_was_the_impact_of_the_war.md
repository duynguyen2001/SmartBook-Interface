<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The use of explosive weapons in populated areas of Ukraine has led to life-threatening injuries, mental and psychological harm, as well as severe damage to civilian property and essential services. Missile strikes across Ukraine, including in the capital Kyiv, have resulted in significant civilian casualties and the destruction of infrastructure imperative for civilian life, such as electricity and water services. These attacks have been described as punitive retaliations, aiming to terrorize civilians and have been widely condemned by the international community. The bombardments have caused suffering by knocking out power and water, shattering buildings, and killing at least 14 people, reflecting a concerning escalation in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The strikes on civilian targets, including hospitals and residential areas, have not only impacted those directly harmed but have also led to increased humanitarian needs, especially ahead of the winter season. The war's effects have extended beyond Ukraine, affecting global food and fuel prices, due to dependencies on Eastern European imports. NATO's Secretary General has highlighted the high number of civilian casualties and stressed that deliberate attacks on civilians constitute war crimes. The G7 leaders have echoed this sentiment, condemning the indiscriminate attacks and reaffirming that targeting innocent civilians is a war crime. In the face of these challenges, the Ukrainian President has sought support through appeals for fast-track NATO membership <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata said the strikes, which could signal a major escalation in the eight-month-old war, appeared to be entirely punitive retaliation meant to terrorize Ukrainian civilians in densely-populated urban neighborhoods, close to government buildings, with one even hitting a children's playground. The lethal barrage smashed into civilian areas, knocking out power and water, shattering buildings and killing at least 14 people. The bombardment came two days after Russia suffered a serious blow with the bombing that damaged its sole bridge to Crimea.|

So the way they are able to then respond is by indiscriminate attacks on Ukrainian cities, hitting civilians, critical infrastructure. And of course, this causes suffering, damage on Ukraine, but in many ways it actually reflects the lack of alternatives for President Putin. They are losing ground, they have lost the momentum, and then they had to revert to missile strikes and airstrikes in a way we saw yesterday and actually also today.|
