In response to the implementation of martial law in four Ukrainian regions—Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk—Russian President Vladimir Putin has directed the establishment of specialized headquarters to ensure the coordination of regional heads.

Additionally, Putin has mandated the formation of a special council that will encompass vice-premiers, law enforcement representatives, socio-economic bloc members of the government, presidential administration officials, and the State Council.

|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow needed to "continue consulting" with the local populations before establishing its borders.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/europe/russia-ukraine-annexation-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 3rd, 2022</div></div>| Russian forces have suffered a series of surprising defeats in eastern Ukraine, forcing them to retreat and abandon several positions in areas the Kremlin declares it is annexing. Much of the territory Moscow claims as its own in Donetsk region is under the control of Ukrainian forces, and the Kremlin appears unsure of the exact borders of the regions it plans to annex. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow needed to "continue consulting" with the local populations before establishing its borders. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that the country had taken back Lyman, while the Ukrainian military said it had recaptured the nearby villages of Drobysheve and Torske, putting Kyiv in a better position as it seeks to take back the Luhansk region.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> The move followed hurriedly arranged and internationally condemned referendums held in each region last month on whether to join Russia.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/10/05/putin-confident-front-will-stabilize-despite-ukrainian-advances-a78990" target="_blank">themoscowtimes.com</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 5th, 2022</div></div>| Bolstered by deliveries of Western weapons, Ukrainian forces are now poised to enter the separatist stronghold of Luhansk. Earlier on Wednesday, Putin formally signed a document formally annexing four Ukrainian regions including Luhansk into law. The move followed hurriedly arranged and internationally condemned referendums held in each region last month on whether to join Russia. Putin said that he had been "not only pleased, but surprised" by the overwhelmingly pro-Russian results.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Putins recent comments about defending parts of Ukraine that he terms Russian territory hint at a lower threshold for nuclear use (the exact geography remains unclear, with the Kremlins spokesman indicating that consultations with locals would determine borders).|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/watch-list-2022-autumn-update" target="_blank">crisisgroup.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 10th, 2022</div></div>| Nuclear use would draw a Western response, and while the Kremlin may want the West to believe that it is willing to take that risk, it seems hard to fathom a Kremlin truly willing to do so to, for example, defend Russias fabricated claim to parts of Zaporizhzhia. Russias own military doctrine foresees nuclear weapons use only in the case of threats to the countrys ability to defend itself (that is, threats to its nuclear arsenal). Putins recent comments about defending parts of Ukraine that he terms Russian territory hint at a lower threshold for nuclear use (the exact geography remains unclear, with the Kremlins spokesman indicating that consultations with locals would determine borders). But Moscows behaviour in this war, which despite the bluster has avoided direct engagement with NATO or military attacks on Ukraines Western backers, suggests that it, like Western powers, seeks to sidestep the worst escalatory risks.|
