## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Ukraine has acquired hand-held electronic warfare systems such as the SkyWiper EDM4S to counter drones, a contract facilitated through the NATO Support and Supply Agency <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Additionally, Ukraine has been receiving anti-drone technology from a private Israeli defense contractor, with the technology reportedly being transferred via Warsaw <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

Ukraine has obtained new counter-drone systems, such as the hand-held electronic warfare SkyWiper EDM4S systems from NT Service, to neutralize small and medium-sized UAVs by disrupting their guidance and navigation systems <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. In addition to these measures, the Ukrainian army also relies on Soviet-era air defense systems like the S-300, while awaiting the delivery of more sophisticated Western systems including the US-made NASAMS <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Moreover, Ukraine has indirectly received anti-drone technology from a private Israeli defense contractor, which was initially sold to Warsaw before being transferred to Kyiv <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This multi-faceted approach to air defense is in response to Ukraine's President Zelenskiy declaring the securing of such systems as the country's top priority in the face of drone threats <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Ukraine has been active in developing and acquiring a range of countermeasures to address the threat posed by kamikaze drones. In addition to ordering hand-held electronic warfare systems designed to counter drones, like the 37 SkyWiper EDM4S systems through the NATO Support and Supply Agency, the country has also been promised counter-drone equipment as part of NATO's Comprehensive Assistance Package, which includes drone jammers designed to render ineffective Russian and Iranian-made drones <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Furthermore, following the increased use of kamikaze drones by Russia, Ukrainian officials have been pleading with Western countries for more air defense systems and ammunition to bolster their defenses against such threats <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>To strengthen their air defense capabilities, Ukraine is receiving advanced weapons from NATO allies, including air defense systems deemed critical to countering invading Russian forces. This includes the promise of missiles for advanced NASAM anti-aircraft systems from Britain and the expedited delivery of NASAMS by the U.S. German IRIS-T systems have already been delivered to Ukraine, and the country is also relying on existing Soviet-era air defense systems like the S-300 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Moreover, there have been reports of Ukraine receiving anti-drone technology from a private Israeli defense contractor, which was sold to Warsaw and subsequently transferred to Kyiv <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. With these measures, Ukraine aims to mitigate the threat posed by drones, which have been characterized as a challenge but not game-changing due to their single-use nature, technical reliability issues, and vulnerability to countermeasures such as jamming <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.
