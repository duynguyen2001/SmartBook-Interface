Russian forces have escalated their use of "kamikaze drones" in attacks against Ukraine, with recent strikes on the city of Zaporizhzhia as a notable example <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This trend began around October 10, when Russia increased the use of these drones to hit deep inside Ukrainian territory, challenging Kyiv's air defenses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. In response to the heightened drone attacks, the US and NATO allies have increased their support for Ukraine by sending additional air defense systems <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Despite the intensification of drone strikes, there has been no indication that Russia is preparing to use its nuclear arsenal, as U.S. officials have observed no movement of nuclear assets, despite previous threats <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Throughout the conflict in Ukraine, there has been a notable escalation in the use of "kamikaze drones" by Russian forces. These drones, unlike traditional military drones that return to base after launching their munitions, are designed to destroy themselves upon striking their targets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Initially, their use was not as prevalent, but starting from October 10, there has been an intensified deployment of these drones for attacks deep inside Ukrainian territory, suggesting a shift in Russian tactics to cause considerable damage to critical infrastructure and power sources <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Ukrainian air defenses have struggled to cope with the surge, highlighting an evolution in the aerial threat landscape <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The drones used by Russia in these attacks have been identified as Iranian-made, specifically the Shahed series, as confirmed by the Ukrainian military and US intelligence <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The increased use of kamikaze drones is seen as a strategic move by Russia to improve precision in medium-range strikes, particularly as its stockpile of conventional precision-guided munitions diminishes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. This pattern of deploying suicide drones has been observed in other conflicts as well, such as in Azerbaijan's use against Armenian forces and by Iranian-backed militias, but their usage in Ukraine represents an emerging challenge for Ukrainian defense forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The response to this threat has included increased support from NATO allies, who have stepped up efforts to supply Ukraine with advanced air defense systems to counter these unmanned aerial vehicles <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.
