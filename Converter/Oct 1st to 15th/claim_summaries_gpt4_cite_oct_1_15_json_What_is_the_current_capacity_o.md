# What is the current capacity of Ukrainian ports under the Black Sea Grain Initiative and what factors are contributing to any limitations?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Ukrainian ports are operating at only 25-30% of their capacity under the Black Sea Grain Initiative due to Russia deliberately delaying the full implementation of the agreement <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The resulting congestion has led to over 150 vessels waiting around Istanbul for clearance, highlighting the urgency for measures to prevent further supply chain and port operation disruptions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Ukrainian ports operating under the Black Sea Grain Initiative are currently functioning at only 25-30% of their capacity, as reported by the Infrastructure Ministry, with Russia being accused of deliberately causing delays in the full implementation of the Grain Initiative <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The congestion is further evidenced by the over 70 ships waiting for inspection in Istanbul, which suggests a bottleneck in the process despite the high demand for Ukrainian grain <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The United Nations has acknowledged the issue of delays, with over 150 vessels waiting around Istanbul, highlighting the need for urgent measures to prevent supply chain disruptions and port operation inefficiencies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. These operational challenges are occurring against the backdrop of a wider agreement that has facilitated the shipment of over 7 million tons of grain since late July, demonstrating the critical role of the Black Sea ports in global food supply <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Ukrainian ports operating under the Black Sea Grain Initiative are facing significant limitations, managing to function at only 25-30% of their capacity in recent times <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This reduced capacity is attributed to deliberate delays by Russia in the full implementation of the Grain Initiative, which is causing congestion and limiting the ability of the ports to operate efficiently <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Additionally, over 150 vessels are reported to be waiting around Istanbul to move, with the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) acknowledging the issue and discussing ways to alleviate the backlog <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The United Nations has called for "urgent measures" to address these delays to prevent disruptions to the supply chain and port operations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The congestion is further evidenced by the piling up of dozens of ships awaiting inspection in Istanbul, with more than 70 loaded ships due for inspection, which indicates both congestion and a growing interest in the grain deal <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The initiative, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, has facilitated the export of more than 6.8 million tons of grain from Ukraine since late July, despite the constraints <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. However, the full capacity of Ukrainian ports is not being utilized due to the inspection queues and Russia's reported interference with food shipments, which impacts the initiative's effectiveness in alleviating global food shortages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

## Claims

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The current deal, created in July for an initial four months, allows Ukrainian grain to flow out of ports in the Odesa region.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/moscow-threatens-to-exit-black-sea-grain-deal/" target="_blank">politico.eu</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 13th, 2022</div></div>| Russian forces are in retreat in the east and south, seven months into the war. And President Vladimir Putin is more isolated than ever after an overwhelming vote at the United Nations to condemn Moscow's unilateral annexation of Ukrainian territory. The current deal, created in July for an initial four months, allows Ukrainian grain to flow out of ports in the Odesa region. As of October 12, more than 7 million tons of Ukrainian grain had left the country through the secured route, according to the U.N.'s Joint Coordination Centre.|

In fact, the organization is not collectively hitting its nominal assigned quotas, making the 2-million-bpd cut more of a fiction than a reality. Following the ministerial meeting in Vienna last week, Saudi Oil Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman admitted that the actual cut in output will be around 1-1.1 million bpd since OPEC members have been missing the previously agreed production baseline for months. Analysts tracking members production and exports expect the actual cut, if it happened, to be less than 1 million bpd and possibly as low as 06-0.8 million bpd.|

More than 70 loaded ships are due for inspection, indicating "some congestion" as well as growing interest in the deal, according to a United Nations spokesperson for the Black Sea Grain Initiative.

|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The Russian Federations actions, such as the blockade of Ukraines food exports in Black Sea ports, setting fields on fire, shelling farms and grain storages, and stealing agricultural hardware have raised food prices and increased the threat of famine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://press.un.org/en/2022/gaef3566.doc.htm" target="_blank">press.un.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| VOLODYMYR LESCHENKO ( Ukraine ), noted that, while shelling and bombing by Russian Federation forces continue to destroy towns and cities in his country, the war has also devastated its economy. Highlighting the Recovery and Development Plan, a draft of which was introduced at the International Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland in July, he pointed out that the war has had severe and far-reaching global repercussions, including on global food security. The Russian Federations actions, such as the blockade of Ukraines food exports in Black Sea ports, setting fields on fire, shelling farms and grain storages, and stealing agricultural hardware have raised food prices and increased the threat of famine. Further, Moscow has turned energy resources into weapons, using countries dependence on Russian oil and gas to achieve its political and geopolitical goals, especially in the run-up to winter.|

Kubrakov said almost 7.7 million tons of agricultural products have been exported since the launch of the initiative, which "has stabilized food prices and countered the threat of global hunger."|
