<template v-slot:summary>
The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, led by IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, has announced plans to search for "dirty bomb" production signs in Ukraine at Kyiv's request <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The IAEA has stressed the importance of demilitarizing the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, echoing Ukrainian President Zelenskiy's demand for safety and security around the facility <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Following a previous inspection, the IAEA called for a protection zone around the plant and has now decided to double the number of inspectors to four, highlighting the urgency of negotiations for a safe zone, especially after Russia's refusal to leave the NPP <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Additionally, the IAEA is planning to monitor the restart of one reactor at the plant amid heightened concerns over nuclear safety <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is sending inspectors to Ukraine to search for any evidence of "dirty bomb" production, responding to a request from Kyiv. The IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi announced the plan and outlined it in a letter, indicating that the inspection is a preventive measure to ensure no such weapons, designed to cause panic rather than significant military harm, are created <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Additionally, the IAEA is doubling its number of inspectors at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear plant, bringing the total to four. This step follows a previous visit where the IAEA mission stayed from September 1 to September 5, leaving two inspectors to monitor the situation indefinitely. The agency's efforts are directed towards establishing a safety and security protection zone around the NPP, amidst concerns over potential radiation accidents and other threats posed by the ongoing conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In the context of the heightened tensions, the IAEA's role is crucial as it seeks to mitigate the risks associated with the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which, if compromised, could release radiation far exceeding the Chernobyl disaster <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy supports the UN nuclear inspector's demands for the demilitarization of the plant, emphasizing the need during an address to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The IAEA's Grossi is also due to visit Moscow to discuss the situation further, particularly after Russian President Vladimir Putin's decree and the ongoing hostilities in the region. The inspectors' mission is part of a broader international response, with Western officials also preparing contingency plans to reassure and support their populations in the unlikely event of a nuclear incident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.
