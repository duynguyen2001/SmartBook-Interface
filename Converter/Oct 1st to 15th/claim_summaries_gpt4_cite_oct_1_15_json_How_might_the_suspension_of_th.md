# How might the suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative affect the prices and availability of grain and fertilizer on the global market?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative risks exacerbating global food insecurity by potentially hiking prices and causing shortages of grain and fertilizer, critical for worldwide crop production <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. With rising costs due to war and export bans, such a suspension could lead to a crisis of availability, especially affecting vulnerable regions already facing famine and high food prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative could lead to significant disruptions in the global grain and fertilizer markets, exacerbating already high food prices and shortages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. With Ukraine's ports blockaded and Russia's export bans on key commodities, the flow of grain and fertilizer to the global market has been severely restricted, affecting food production and pricing worldwide <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The urgent need for these supplies is highlighted by the potential impact on the upcoming planting seasons, which could lead to a crisis of availability if farmers lack access to affordable fertilizers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Furthermore, protectionist measures, such as export bans by major food producers, have been shown to contribute to the increase in world wheat prices, further emphasizing the importance of maintaining open trade to mitigate the food crisis <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative could severely impact the global market, exacerbating the current food security crisis and leading to increased prices for grain and fertilizer. The Black Sea Grain Initiative played a crucial role in allowing the export of over nine million metric tons of grain and other food products, which helped to lower global food prices and provide relief to vulnerable populations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. With the blockade of Ukrainian grain exports through Black Sea ports by Russia, a significant amount of global grain supply was previously stalled, and Ukraine's role as a major exporter of wheat and corn was heavily compromised <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Additionally, the war in Ukraine and the blockade led by Russia earlier in the year have already contributed to major price hikes and shortages in key commodities, further threatening global food security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>If the initiative is not renewed or if it remains suspended, the prices of grain and fertilizer are likely to surge, affecting global markets and particularly hitting hard on developing countries. These countries are already facing additional challenges like drought and famine, and higher food prices would have a disproportionate impact <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The UN has warned that without the continuation of the initiative, there would be dramatic effects on food production and prices worldwide, turning the current crisis of affordability into a crisis of availability <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Moreover, the situation is compounded by Russia's response to sanctions, where it has limited energy exports, indirectly influencing the cost of food production, and the fact that protectionist measures by major food producers are worsening the food crisis <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> All these actions have exacerbated an already dire global economic situation and contributed to major price hikes and shortages in key Russian- and Ukrainian-produced commodities, with major implications for global food security.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/watch-list-2022-autumn-update" target="_blank">crisisgroup.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 10th, 2022</div></div>| Throughout the war, it has destroyed and stolen Ukrainian grain supplies and damaged grain storage sites. For months, it blockaded Ukraines southern ports in the Black Sea and closed off the Sea of Azov, while responding to Western sanctions by banning the export of many commodities from Russia, including the fertiliser that many countries rely upon. All these actions have exacerbated an already dire global economic situation and contributed to major price hikes and shortages in key Russian- and Ukrainian-produced commodities, with major implications for global food security. Moreover, grievances at Western capitals, while entirely understandable, should not stop governments around the world from taking a clear stand against violations of Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity and the repeated nuclear threats issued by its bigger neighbour.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> If fuel prices rise as expected, that will also increase the cost of food, which is already elevated due to the war in Ukraine and Russias earlier blockade of Ukrainian grain exports.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.mei.edu/blog/special-briefing-policy-and-geopolitical-implications-opec-oil-production-cuts" target="_blank">mei.edu</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| It comes at a time when the Russians were having significant difficulties keeping up with their losses in weapons systems, vehicles, and ammunition on the battlefield. This latest production cut provides them a lifeline. If fuel prices rise as expected, that will also increase the cost of food, which is already elevated due to the war in Ukraine and Russias earlier blockade of Ukrainian grain exports. That will have a disproportionate impact on developing countries, some of which, like Somalia and its neighbors in the greater East Africa region, are currently experiencing a serious drought and widespread famine.|

We should build on the progress made under the Black Sea Grain Initiative and at the 12th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation by urgently phasing out export bans imposed by major food producers. Protectionist measures only serve to make the food crisis worse, accounting for as much as 9 percent of the increase in world wheat prices, according to the World Bank. Third, increase food production and improve distribution, including through ensuring adequate access to fertilisers and crop diversification.|

However, Moscow's blockade of Black Sea ports earlier this year stalled millions of tons of grain exports from Ukraine. TheBlack Sea Grain Initiative brokered in July by the UN and Turkey ended months of the blockade, allowing grain ships to navigate a safe corridor through the Black Sea, helping alleviate global food shortages. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the importance of the deal, adding that since July Ukraine has exported 8 million tons of food by sea.|

This life-saving agreement between Russia,Ukraine, and Turkey, brokered in July by the United Nations, has allowed the export of more than nine million metric tons of grain and other food products to populations around the world in the midst of a devastating global food crisis," USAID Administrator Samantha Power wrote in a statement Sunday. She touted the "tremendous success" of the deal so far, crediting it with lowering global food prices and providing relief to those "most vulnerable to severe hunger." Remember: Moscow announced it was leaving the grain deal after blaming Ukraine for adrone attackon Crimea Saturday.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The Russian Federations actions, such as the blockade of Ukraines food exports in Black Sea ports, setting fields on fire, shelling farms and grain storages, and stealing agricultural hardware have raised food prices and increased the threat of famine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://press.un.org/en/2022/gaef3566.doc.htm" target="_blank">press.un.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| VOLODYMYR LESCHENKO ( Ukraine ), noted that, while shelling and bombing by Russian Federation forces continue to destroy towns and cities in his country, the war has also devastated its economy. Highlighting the Recovery and Development Plan, a draft of which was introduced at the International Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland in July, he pointed out that the war has had severe and far-reaching global repercussions, including on global food security. The Russian Federations actions, such as the blockade of Ukraines food exports in Black Sea ports, setting fields on fire, shelling farms and grain storages, and stealing agricultural hardware have raised food prices and increased the threat of famine. Further, Moscow has turned energy resources into weapons, using countries dependence on Russian oil and gas to achieve its political and geopolitical goals, especially in the run-up to winter.|

Failure to do what is necessary is unacceptable, but not impossible to imagine. Civil unrest, state collapse, and multilateral breakdown could well be the consequences of our collective failure. Why would we condemn ourselves to a worse, more damaging, fate if we could take the necessary steps now to rebuild our international system, with a clear understanding of the gaps and a vision for the future that can be greater than the sum of its parts?|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> The deal includes a three-year side arrangement between the UN and Russia to help ensure exports of its own grains and fertilizers including ammonia from one of its major Black Sea ports as well.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.passblue.com/2022/10/07/trending-un-news-week-ending-oct-7/" target="_blank">passblue.com</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 7th, 2022</div></div>| Rebeca Grynspan, the UNs trade expert, and Martin Griffiths, the UN humanitarian relief chief, hope to turn the deal, which is up for renewal on Nov. 19, into a one-year plan. So far, 5.2 million metric tons of grains and other foodstuffs have been freed from Ukraines main ports since the war started on Feb. 24. The deal includes a three-year side arrangement between the UN and Russia to help ensure exports of its own grains and fertilizers including ammonia from one of its major Black Sea ports as well. Putin began to complain last month that the Black Sea deal was not benefiting Russia and that most of the grain exports were not reaching the worlds poorest countries.|
