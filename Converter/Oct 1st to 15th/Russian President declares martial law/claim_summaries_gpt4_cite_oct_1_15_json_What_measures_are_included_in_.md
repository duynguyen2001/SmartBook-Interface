## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The martial law decree signed by President Putin introduces strengthened security and law enforcement services, the creation of territorial defense headquarters, and the possibility of evacuation, particularly in the Kherson region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This enforcement is likely to intensify the control over the annexed Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, affecting residents with increased militarization and potentially displacing them from their homes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

President Putin signed a decree introducing martial law in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions, which entails a strengthening of security and law enforcement services in these areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. According to the decree, territorial defense headquarters are to be established, and while there are no plans to evacuate residents from Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia, the exception is Kherson region where evacuations are already taking place <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This move, reflecting Putin's difficult position, has been interpreted by President Biden as an attempt to brutalize and intimidate Ukrainian citizens into submission, which is unlikely to succeed <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The martial law measures are a part of Russia's wider claim over these regions, following controversial votes and parliamentary ratification, and despite international opposition and legal violations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

President Putin announced the introduction of martial law in the four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, which became effective on October 20, 2022 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The decree establishes territorial defense headquarters in these regions, with the implication of heightened activity from security and law enforcement services as stated by Viktor Vodolatsky, a Russian State Duma deputy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. In addition, extra powers are granted to local leaders, potentially affecting the daily lives and governance of the residents in these areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The martial law regime will not involve the evacuation of residents from the Donetsk People's Republic, Luhansk People's Republic, or Zaporizhzhia region; however, an evacuation is already underway in the Kherson region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This action signifies a significant change in the level of control that Russian authorities will exert over these regions, with President Biden interpreting the move as an act of brutalization and intimidation towards Ukrainian citizens <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, the formal ratification of the annexation by Russian parliament and Putin's willingness to use all means to defend these territories, including nuclear threats, underscores the severity of the situation and the potential implications for those living in the annexed regions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> The borders of the territories Moscow is claiming remain unclear, but the Kremlin has promised to defend Russias territory with Putin last week pledging to use "all the powers and means at our disposal" a comment widely interpreted as a nuclear threat.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/5/putin-signs-laws-annexing-4-ukrainian-regions" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 5th, 2022</div></div>| Earlier this week, both houses of the Russian parliament ratified treaties making Ukraines Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions part of Russia.

|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> On March 4, 2022, the European Council unanimously agreed to activate the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) for the first time in the blocs history.5 Eligible individuals fleeing the war in Ukraine need only register for residence in any EU Member State in order to secure access to housing, social welfare assistance, healthcare, education, employment, and banking services there.6 Protection is valid for at least one year and up to three years and also grants the right to move freely in the EU for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.7 Individuals can also decide to change their residence and re-register for temporary protection in a different EU Member State.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.refugeesinternational.org/reports-briefs/preparing-for-the-unpredictable-ensuring-the-protection-and-inclusion-of-refugees-from-ukraine-in-romania-and-moldova/" target="_blank">refugeesinternational.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The EU also deployed extra staff from its Border and Coast Guard Agency, Frontex, to help frontline states (Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia) manage arrivals at the borders. On March 2, 2022, the European Commission issued operational guidelines that encouraged authorities to relax border checks, adopt more flexible entry conditions for non-EU nationals (including non-Ukrainians), and allow passage through temporary, unofficial border crossing points. On March 4, 2022, the European Council unanimously agreed to activate the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) for the first time in the blocs history.5 Eligible individuals fleeing the war in Ukraine need only register for residence in any EU Member State in order to secure access to housing, social welfare assistance, healthcare, education, employment, and banking services there.6 Protection is valid for at least one year and up to three years and also grants the right to move freely in the EU for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.7 Individuals can also decide to change their residence and re-register for temporary protection in a different EU Member State.

|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Finally, the EAC has never before deployed a peacekeeping or enforcement operation, much less put in place safeguards for protecting civilians, raising considerable concerns about human rights violations by the troops themselves.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/watch-list-2022-autumn-update" target="_blank">crisisgroup.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 10th, 2022</div></div>| The forces deployment could also energise armed groups unhappy with an influx of foreign soldiers, escalating levels of violence, including against civilians. Nor is it clear how the new force will coordinate with MONUSCO, which has an overlapping territorial writ but a different mandate focused on civilian protection. Finally, the EAC has never before deployed a peacekeeping or enforcement operation, much less put in place safeguards for protecting civilians, raising considerable concerns about human rights violations by the troops themselves. Funding shortfalls are one reason the joint force has not yet fully deployed.|

The young woman who only identified herself to Dimitrov by the name Elena, said that since the latest passage of laws including expansion of the Russias "gay propaganda" law to include adults last December, coupled with the crackdown by the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media, abbreviated as Roskomnadzor, on any websites and on popular phone apps that cater to LGBTQ+ people, she has now begun efforts in earnest to leave the country. Last week the lower house of the Russian Parliament, colloquially referred to as the State Duma, passed on its final reading a bill that would outlaw gender transitioning procedures in the Russian Federation. The measure now heads to the Federation Council, or upper House where it is expected to pass in the scheduled vote on July 19 and then transmitted to Russian President Vladimir Putin for his approval and signature which is expected.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Putin, whose partial mobilization order earlier this month triggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of men of fighting age from Russia, stopped short of declaring martial law or a counterterrorism operation, as many had expected.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/kyiv-missile-strike-russia-cities-1.6611910" target="_blank">CBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The Russian president has been under intense domestic pressure to take more aggressive action to stop a largely successful Ukrainian counteroffensive and to react forcefully to Saturday's attack on the Kerch Bridge, whose construction he used to cement his 2014 annexation of Crimea. The missile strikes marked the biggest and most widespread Russian attacks in months. Putin, whose partial mobilization order earlier this month triggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of men of fighting age from Russia, stopped short of declaring martial law or a counterterrorism operation, as many had expected. But the sustained barrage on major cities hit residential areas and critical infrastructure facilities alike, portending a major surge in the war amid a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in recent weeks and raising questions about how "precise" Russia's targeting is.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> In Putins Russia, war is peace, slavery is freedom, ignorance is strength and illegally annexing a sovereign countrys territory is fighting colonialism.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/japan-times-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/10/05/commentary/world-commentary/russian-imperialism/" target="_blank">The Japan Times</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 5th, 2022</div></div>| Not since the Soviet Union collapsed have I listened to a speech as Orwellian as the one Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered to declare that four Ukrainian regions are now Russia. Just as communism was once supposed to save humanity from imperialist exploitation, Russia is now apparently responsible for defending countries right not to be subjected to a "new colonialism" that would turn them into Western vassals. In Putins Russia, war is peace, slavery is freedom, ignorance is strength and illegally annexing a sovereign countrys territory is fighting colonialism. In Putins mind, he is righting a historic injustice, as the annexed regions Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were once part of Novorossiya (New Russia), brought into the Russian empire by Catherine the Great.|

Despite the setbacks, he shared that his country would soon submit its voluntary national review. He yet asked the Committee: "How can you imagine a country that has been fighting terrorism to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and expect that the country suffering from unilateral coercive measures will not be left behind?" Stressing that the Israeli occupation of the Palestine occupied territories "steals the resources" from them, he emphasized the importance of the annual resolution adopted by this Committee on the permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the territories including East Jerusalem, as well as the Arab population in the Syrian Golan.|
