Russia's President Putin, facing a war not going as planned, resorted to annexations, partial mobilization, and nuclear rhetoric, marking a significant escalation since the conflict's inception <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Putin's decision for mass mobilization and the targeting of Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure in retaliation for an attack on a bridge connecting Russia to annexed Crimea further intensified the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

The primary causes of the escalation into war between Ukraine and Russia in 2022 can be traced back to a series of deep-seated issues and actions. At the heart of the conflict lies Russia's resistance to Ukraine's democratic transformation and alignment with Western institutions, particularly NATO, which Russia perceives as a direct threat to its own security and influence <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. This was exacerbated by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatist movements in the Donbas region, reflecting a broader trend of regional aggression and authoritarianism dictated by Russia in its near abroad <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. President Putin's obsession with Ukraine, rooted in his conviction that a truly independent Ukraine poses an existential threat to Russia, has led to a series of decisions escalating tensions and ultimately to the invasion in February 2022 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The escalation into full-scale war was also driven by President Putin's strategic miscalculations and the backlash against his policies at home and abroad <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The partial mobilization in Russia and the indiscriminate attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure are indicative of the war not going as planned for Putin <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, international concerns over the conflict, including the potential for escalating military conflict and the impact on energy security, have intensified, with G7 leaders committing to phase out dependency on Russian energy and to ensure stable global energy supplies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The ongoing war in Ukraine, therefore, represents not only a clash over territorial integrity and political sovereignty but also a confrontation between differing visions for the international order, with Russia and China posing challenges to Western-led systems <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

It is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and the growing capacity to do it.

And many people in the world think that this work by Russia started in February 2022 but the truth is this war started in February 2014.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> For many Russians, the war in Ukraine did not begin in February but September, when Putin announced his plans for mass mobilization of soldiers, starting with 300,000 new conscripts as a move to stop Russias losses on the battlefield.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/13/putin-ukraine-escalation-power-war/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 13th, 2022</div></div>| The paramount objective of all autocrats is to stay in power. Yet Putins escalation of his invasion in Ukraine is undermining this objective. For many Russians, the war in Ukraine did not begin in February but September, when Putin announced his plans for mass mobilization of soldiers, starting with 300,000 new conscripts as a move to stop Russias losses on the battlefield. Overnight, the war ignored for months by most Russians suddenly became a personal issue for nearly every family.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Haunted by the Soviet collapse, he is convinced that the consolidation of a democratic and European Ukraine will act as a catalyst for the next chapter in Russias imperial retreat.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/pariah-putin-has-little-reason-to-celebrate-on-his-seventieth-birthday/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 7th, 2022</div></div>| His well-documented obsession with Ukraine has clearly clouded his judgment and led him into a series of disastrous decisions that have undone the progress made during the early years of his reign. This obsession is rooted in Putins conviction that the emergence of a genuinely independent Ukraine is an historical aberration that poses an existential threat to Russia itself. Haunted by the Soviet collapse, he is convinced that the consolidation of a democratic and European Ukraine will act as a catalyst for the next chapter in Russias imperial retreat. Despite his best efforts to contain the conflict within Ukraine, there are signs that instability is indeed coming to Putins Russia.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> It is a dangerous time, and concerns have heightened over not only the potential for escalating military conflict, but also over energy security and the vulnerability and high prices of energy supplies.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/nuclear-energy-and-global-energy-security-in-the-new-tripolar-world-order/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 12th, 2022</div></div>| The Russian invasion of sovereign Ukraine, along with Chinese military buildup and threats against Taiwan, seem to portend the emergence of a new tripolar world order and a shifting paradigm from great power competition to great power confrontation. And despite the apparent concerns raised by President Xi in his recent meeting with President Putin in Uzbekistan over the war in Ukraine, the meeting confirmed the continuing alliance of these authoritarian states against the United States and NATO. It is a dangerous time, and concerns have heightened over not only the potential for escalating military conflict, but also over energy security and the vulnerability and high prices of energy supplies. On May 2, G7 leaders stated their commitment to: (1) "phase out our dependency on Russian energy"; (2) work with partners to "ensure stable and sustainable global energy supplies and affordable prices for consumers"; and (3) accelerate "reduction of overall reliance on fossil fuels and our transition to clean energy in accordance with our climate objectives."|

HOW ARE THE ATTACKS PORTRAYED IN RUSSIA? President Vladimir Putin described the strikes as a response to what he called terrorist attacks by Ukraine, including a blast on Sunday that damaged Russia's bridge to Crimea, which it built after annexing the peninsula it seized in 2014. Hawks in Russia had been demanding for weeks that Putin escalate the conflict, and many of them hailed Monday's attacks.|

"Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, recklessly flouting the basic laws of the international order today, as its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has shown." China "is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to advance that objective," the president wrote.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> However, Ukraines desire to join NATO was not the only reason for Russias invasion of Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/10/06/ukraine-joins-nato-assessing-future-disasters/" target="_blank">moderndiplomacy.eu</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 6th, 2022</div></div>| Back to Think Basically, the main reason for Russias invasion of Ukraine is Ukraines desire to join NATO, while NATO according to Russia is a threat to its territory and power. However, Ukraines desire to join NATO was not the only reason for Russias invasion of Ukraine. From February to October 2022, the Russian-Ukrainian invasion seems to be progressing, although it is too early to predict and analyze the Russian-Ukrainian invasion, but it does not seem wrong to prepare for the worst in the future.|
