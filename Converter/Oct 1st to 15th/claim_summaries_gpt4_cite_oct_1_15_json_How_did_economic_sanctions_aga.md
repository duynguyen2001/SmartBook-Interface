Economic sanctions imposed by the G7 have put significant pressure on Russia's economy, targeting critical sources of goods and inputs, which has contributed to Russia's international isolation and inability to extract concessions through its nuclear threats <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These sanctions, part of a broader coalition effort, have supported Ukraine's defense and mitigated some of the war's global ripple effects, such as food security challenges exacerbated by Russia's actions, including the blockade of Ukrainian ports and the export ban on commodities like fertilizer <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the sanctions have been coupled with military support for Ukraine, including the potential for more sophisticated weaponry and defense systems in the event of a nuclear attack by Russia, indicating a willingness to escalate economic and military responses if necessary <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Despite Ukraine's strategic successes and the impact of sanctions on Russia, continuous international support and aid remain crucial for Ukraine to maintain its defensive positions and address the ongoing conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Economic sanctions imposed by the G7 and other Western nations have significantly impacted Russia by targeting its key sources of revenue, including critical goods and inputs necessary for its economy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. These sanctions have compounded the difficulties Russia faces in replacing its vast amounts of military equipment lost or expended in Ukraine, as international restrictions hinder its ability to obtain replacements <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the sanctions have led to more sophisticated weapons systems being supplied to Ukraine, such as longer-range missile systems and better air defense weapons, which have bolstered Ukraine's military capabilities against poorly trained and demoralized Russian conscripts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>Russia's introduction of draconian penalties for deserters and its first mobilization since World War II reflect the strain that the sanctions, coupled with battlefield losses, have placed on its military operations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The sanctions' squeeze on Russia's economy is also seen as a contributing factor to its isolation and inability to make concessions, reinforcing the country's international isolation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite Russia's attempts to counteract the sanctions by withholding commodities like fertilizer and blockading Ukrainian ports, these actions have only exacerbated the global economic situation without yielding strategic advantages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. As a result, the economic sanctions have not only restricted Russia's military resupply efforts but have also contributed to the preservation of Ukraine's sovereignty by supporting its defense and complicating Russian advances on the battlefield <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

For months, it blockaded Ukraines southern ports in the Black Sea and closed off the Sea of Azov, while responding to Western sanctions by banning the export of many commodities from Russia, including the fertiliser that many countries rely upon. All these actions have exacerbated an already dire global economic situation and contributed to major price hikes and shortages in key Russian- and Ukrainian-produced commodities, with major implications for global food security. Moreover, grievances at Western capitals, while entirely understandable, should not stop governments around the world from taking a clear stand against violations of Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity and the repeated nuclear threats issued by its bigger neighbour.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Weve worked closely with our European friends to address the global ripple effects of the war, from striking an energy supply deal that helped cut dependence on Russian gas to driving new investments in food security globally.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/whitehousegov" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/13/remarks-by-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-on-the-biden-harris-administrations-national-security-strategy/" target="_blank">Whitehouse.gov</a></div><div>*(Think Tank / Policy Group)*</div><div>Oct 13th, 2022</div></div>| We wove together a coalition of nations to help Ukrainians defend their country with enormous military, economic, and humanitarian support. We united the G7 to impose unprecedented economic costs that are squeezing Russias key sources of critical goods and inputs for its economy. Weve worked closely with our European friends to address the global ripple effects of the war, from striking an energy supply deal that helped cut dependence on Russian gas to driving new investments in food security globally. And we have put months of quiet work to help shepherd Finland and Sweden into NATO, proving that Putins actions have only infused the Alliance with a sense of common purpose that it has not seen in decades.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> The democratic world would be compelled to respond, both with more sophisticated weapons for Ukraine fighter aircraft (MiG-29s), longer-range missile systems (ATACMS) and better air defense weapons (Patriots) as well as genuinely crippling sanctions, such as designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/13/putin-ukraine-escalation-power-war/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 13th, 2022</div></div>| And yet, if Putin were to use a nuclear weapon (God forbid), that might also very likely deliver the final blow to his hold on power in Russia. No world leader would support him. The democratic world would be compelled to respond, both with more sophisticated weapons for Ukraine fighter aircraft (MiG-29s), longer-range missile systems (ATACMS) and better air defense weapons (Patriots) as well as genuinely crippling sanctions, such as designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. After a nuclear attack, no Ukrainian leader would call for surrender.|

It is notable that Russias repeated nuclear threats have not managed to extract any meaningful concessions from Ukraine, the United States or Europe. If anything, they have worsened Russias international isolation. But this fits the historical pattern: Nuclear threats are credible tools of self-defense, not aggression.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Already, Russias recent loss of the town Lyman, which its forces used as a logistics hub in Ukraines eastern Donetsk region, would "significantly affect Russias ability to supply, resupply and move its forces all along that forward line of conflict," she said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/defense-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2022/10/03/russian-forces-poised-for-major-defeat-in-kherson-says-dod-official/" target="_blank">Defense News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 3rd, 2022</div></div>| "That would be a major defeat for Russia because it pushes back even more Russias ambition to take Odessa, which was one of the stated objectives earlier this year," Wallander said at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event. "It gives Ukraine another defensive position to ride out what probably will be hot fighting over the winter," Wallander said, adding that in spite of Ukraines recent strategic successes, the U.S. and international community must continue to supply Ukraine with aid. Already, Russias recent loss of the town Lyman, which its forces used as a logistics hub in Ukraines eastern Donetsk region, would "significantly affect Russias ability to supply, resupply and move its forces all along that forward line of conflict," she said. A senior U.S. military official said that Russian troops had fallen back to Kremmina, a town more than 30 kilometers east of Lyman.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> International sanctions make it difficult for Russia to replace the vast amounts of equipment lost or expended in Ukraine, while many question the military value is poorly trained and demoralized conscripts against the increasingly well-armed and superbly motivated Ukrainians.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/pariah-putin-has-little-reason-to-celebrate-on-his-seventieth-birthday/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 7th, 2022</div></div>| With large numbers of Russian troops simply refusing to fight, Putin was recently forced to introduce draconian new penalties for deserters while also announcing Russias first mobilization since World War II. It not clear whether these desperate measures will enable Putin to stop the rot within his army. International sanctions make it difficult for Russia to replace the vast amounts of equipment lost or expended in Ukraine, while many question the military value is poorly trained and demoralized conscripts against the increasingly well-armed and superbly motivated Ukrainians.

Because the reality is that they're not able to make progress on the battlefield. Russia is actually losing the battlefield. They are giving up territory because they don't have the capabilities to stop the Ukrainian forces making advances.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> In Beijing, the war is most likely seen as another manifestation of the Wests tendency to cast stalemate as success, ill-targeted aid as resolve, sanctions as salvation and feel-good images as substantive progress.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/10/15/disparate-perceptions-muddy-us-china-relations/" target="_blank">eastasiaforum.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 15th, 2022</div></div>| Masking this precarious dynamic is the carousel of visits undertaken by Western leaders to salute the courage of Ukrainian President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people. The visits do not affect the strategic equation, but Ukraine is portrayed as an ongoing triumph. In Beijing, the war is most likely seen as another manifestation of the Wests tendency to cast stalemate as success, ill-targeted aid as resolve, sanctions as salvation and feel-good images as substantive progress. Such disparate perceptions on the part of the United States and China regarding Ukraine could lead to miscalculation and conflict in Taiwan.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Echoing Ryabkov, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said continued US weapons deliveries to Ukraine would prolong the fighting and inflict more damage to the country.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/3925496/russia-showers-ukraine-more-missiles" target="_blank">english.aawsat.com</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| They remain under the control of three member countries the US, UK and France. Meanwhile, Russias deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, warned Tuesday that Western military assistance to Kyiv, including training Ukrainian soldiers in NATO countries and feeding Ukraine real-time satellite data to target Russian forces, has "increasingly drawn Western nations into the conflict on the part of the Kyiv regime." Echoing Ryabkov, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said continued US weapons deliveries to Ukraine would prolong the fighting and inflict more damage to the country. Asked during a conference call with reporters about Washington's intention to provide Ukraine with advanced air defense systems, Peskov said the move would "only drag the conflict out and make it more painful" for Ukraine without changing Russian goals.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> The attacks were the latest of many head-spinning events from Ukrainian victories on the ground to Russian President Vladimir Putins threat of nuclear weapons use that have changed the nature and tempo of the war in recent weeks, and raised questions about whether the United States and its partners may have to move beyond the concept of helping Ukraine defend itself, and instead more forcefully facilitate a Ukrainian victory.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/10/10/russia-ukraine-war-turning-point/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 10th, 2022</div></div>| The strikes, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken described as "wave after wave of missiles" struck "childrens playgrounds and public parks," left at least 14 killed and nearly 100 wounded, and cut electricity and water in much of the country. "By launching missile attacks on civilians sleeping in their homes or rushing toward children going to schools, Russia has proven once again that it is a terrorist state that must be deterred in the strongest possible ways," Ukraines United Nations Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said at the opening of a General Assembly session scheduled before the assault to promote world condemnation of Moscow. The attacks were the latest of many head-spinning events from Ukrainian victories on the ground to Russian President Vladimir Putins threat of nuclear weapons use that have changed the nature and tempo of the war in recent weeks, and raised questions about whether the United States and its partners may have to move beyond the concept of helping Ukraine defend itself, and instead more forcefully facilitate a Ukrainian victory.
