The international community, including Ukraine, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and NATO, has rejected these claims, suggesting they could be part of a Russian disinformation campaign or a pretext for a false-flag operation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
Russia has claimed, without providing any evidence, that Ukraine possesses the technology to create a dirty bomb and is planning to use it, an accusation that has been dismissed by the international community including Ukraine, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and NATO <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. These entities have accused Russia of potentially setting up a false-flag operation, which could serve as a pretext for further military action on their part <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The Russian Defense Ministry's statement alleging Kyiv's plans for a dirty bomb provocation came from a briefing on October 24 and has added to the tensions between the two nations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Ukrainian officials have categorically denied these accusations and have gone as far as inviting UN inspectors into the country to verify the absence of such plans, demonstrating their willingness to be transparent and to show that they "have nothing to hide" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reiterated US support for Ukraine, re-emphasizing the baselessness of the Russian allegations in a conversation with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The lack of concrete evidence from Russia and the strong international rebuttals, along with Ukraine's open invitation to the UN, significantly undermine the credibility of the Russian claims regarding Ukraine's intentions with a dirty bomb <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

But mass graves had been prepared near the prison before the attack, and there were no Russians among the victims.

And that prompts a disquieting question: If Putin were to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, how should the United States respond? We have gobs of theory about how nuclear weapons deter (or dont), but we have few empirics to back up any of the assertions. As the security scholar Francis Gavin has written, political scientists, who inhabit an increasingly quantitative discipline, have few "Ns" with which to work when it comes to this subject that is, the sample size to base their analysis on is small.|

Russia is looking to redirect supplies away from the Nord Stream Baltic gas pipelines, damaged in explosions last month that are still under investigation. Russia blamed the West, without providing evidence, and rejected what it called "stupid" assertions that it had sabotaged the pipelines itself.

After all, Russias military doctrine allows for a nuclear strike to defend Russian territory against an existential threat. Russias illegal annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provides the pretext for such an attack.|

The president's grim assessment, delivered Thursday during a Democratic fundraiser, rippled around the globe and appeared to edge beyond the boundaries of current U.S. intelligence assessments. U.S. security officials continue to say they have no evidence that Vladimir Putin has imminent plans for a nuclear strike. Biden veered into talk about Ukraine at the end of his standard fundraising remarks, saying that Putin was "not joking when he talks about the use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons."|
