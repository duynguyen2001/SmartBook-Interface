Diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant involve negotiations for a safety zone, led by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its Director General Rafael Grossi, who has warned about the risks of a nuclear accident and is in intense consultations with Ukraine and Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite the absence of an agreement, the IAEA plans to send experts to Ukraine's nuclear power plants, including Zaporizhzhia, to maintain safety and prevent accidents amidst the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The urgency of establishing a safety zone is underscored by the operational risks, with Russian forces using the plant as a military base and Ukraine targeting military assets, heightening the potential for a nuclear incident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The recent missile incident in Poland has further highlighted the risks of escalation in the region, emphasizing the need for a diplomatic resolution to protect civilian populations and avert a nuclear catastrophe <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is actively involved in diplomatic efforts to establish a safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, a region marked by conflict and military occupation. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has been engaged in "intense consultations" with both Ukrainian and Russian officials to create this zone, aiming to ensure nuclear safety and security, though an agreement has yet to be reached <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The urgency of these negotiations is underscored by the precarious situation at the plant, which has experienced disruptions to its external power supply, necessitating reliance on emergency diesel generators. The plant remains a significant concern due to its use as a military base by Russian forces, which increases the risk of a nuclear accident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>As the conflict continues, the IAEA has sent experts to all operating nuclear power plants in Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, which is under Russian control, to provide assistance and prevent a nuclear accident amid the hostilities. The agency has a permanent team at Zaporizhzhia and is expanding its presence at other locations, reinforcing the critical need for a protective zone around nuclear sites <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Additionally, Ukraine has accused Russian forces of using the power plant as cover to launch attacks, further complicating the situation and highlighting the plant's vulnerability in the conflict zone. International concerns are heightened by the potential for a nuclear meltdown triggered by military actions in the vicinity of the power station <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font><font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

CNN is unable to verify the claims by Energoatom or the Russian government. Grossi and the IAEA have repeatedly called for both sides to implement a nuclear safety and security zone around Zaporizhzhia, Europes largest nuclear power plant. Grossi has taken part in "intense consultations with Ukraine and Russia about establishing such a zone, but so far without an agreement," the IAEA said.|

Captured by Russian forces in March, Moscow has turned the grounds into a missile launching platform, presumably to deter the kind of devastating counter-battery strikes that Ukraine has been using to pound Russian logistical and headquarters targets in other regions. The plant continues to operate and there are signs Russia is attempting to disconnect it from the Ukrainian grid and redirect its electrical power into Russia But Ukraine has not completely refrained from targeting missile batteries and other miliary units houses at Zaporizhzhia, raising international coverage of a nuclear meltdown sparked by an errant artillery round. Whatever the inherent dangers, the plant remains very visibly on the front line between two warring states and an object lesson about the limitations of risk planning.|
