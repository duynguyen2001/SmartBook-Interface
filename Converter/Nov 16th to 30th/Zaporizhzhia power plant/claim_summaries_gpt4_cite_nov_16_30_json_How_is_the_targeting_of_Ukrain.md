# How is the targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure by Russian forces affecting the country's nuclear energy sector and electricity supply?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure have caused power outages, risking the overheating of nuclear fuel due to the shutdown of reactors' cooling systems, and have led to the disconnection of three nuclear power plants from the grid, exacerbating electricity supply issues as winter sets in <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest, now requires power from the grid for cooling and safety systems, which has been compromised due to targeted shelling, necessitating the use of emergency diesel generators <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Russian military's focus on destroying Ukraine's energy infrastructure has led to significant disruptions in the country's nuclear energy sector, causing all four nuclear power plants, including the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant which is Europe's largest, to face operational challenges, such as needing to switch to emergency diesel generators due to power outages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The targeted strikes have resulted in rolling blackouts across Ukraine, with approximately one-third of the country's power-generating capacity being taken out, as winter sets in <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The nuclear reactors, although shut down, still require electricity to prevent the nuclear fuel from overheating, posing a risk if the power driving the cooling systems is cut <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. To mitigate these power supply issues, the EU and the UK are providing financial support for essential equipment like generators and power cables through the Ukraine Energy Support Fund <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The ongoing conflict has seen Russian forces target Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including the nation's nuclear power plants, which has led to significant disruptions in electricity supply as the country relies heavily on nuclear energy for around half of its electricity generation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Attacks on energy infrastructure have resulted in rolling blackouts across Ukraine, with about a third of Ukraine's power-generating capacity taken out, particularly as winter sets in <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe's largest nuclear station, along with other plants, has been forced to shut down reactors as a precautionary measure, switching to emergency diesel generators due to shelling that has cut off power lines, triggering concerns over nuclear safety <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>These shutdowns require nuclear plants to draw power from the grid to maintain vital cooling and safety systems, and continued shelling has led to power outages that risk the overheating of nuclear fuel if cooling systems fail <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The targeting of power lines by both Russian and Ukrainian forces has been disputed, but the result is the same: a precarious situation that threatens a nuclear catastrophe <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. International efforts, including assistance from the EU and the UK, have been directed at restoring power supplies through the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, but the situation remains critical as the ZNPP and other nuclear facilities operate on back-up power amidst ongoing military actions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

The final working reactor at ZNPP was shut down in September as a precautionary measure. Nuclear plants supply power to the grid when operating, but when shut down they actually draw power from it in order to run vital cooling and safety systems, which means disruption to electricity supply is a major concern. On 23 November, shelling of power infrastructure in Ukraine by Russian troops led to blackouts that caused emergency diesel generators to start up at ZNPP, as well as at reactors across Ukraines three other nuclear plants that had previously made it through the war with relatively little disruption.|

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi has repeatedly warned that a nuclear catastrophe could result if fighting in the region is not halted. Russian attacks cut off essential power to all four of Ukraine's nuclear power plants last week, forcing operators to conduct high-risk procedures. "We must do everything we can to prevent nuclear accidents at any of these nuclear facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we already witnessing in Ukraine," Grossi said.|

The team of IAEA experts present at the power plant said it lost off-site power at 3:30 p.m. local time Wednesday when it was fully disconnected from the grid, "following reports of widespread military action targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure," IAEA said in a statement. "Initially all the site's 20 diesel generators started operating automatically, and now eight of them are supplying the site with back-up electricity needed for all safety related equipment.|

Kyiv and Moscow blamed each other for the attacks. Ukraines national nuclear power company Energoatom said it appeared that Russian forces were trying to hinder the countrys ability to provide electricity to its citizens. The Kremlin has, in recent weeks, carried out a campaign of bombings and airstrikes on Ukrainian infrastructure designed to cripple Kyivs ability to provide heat to its residents as winter approaches.|

Captured by Russian forces in March, Moscow has turned the grounds into a missile launching platform, presumably to deter the kind of devastating counter-battery strikes that Ukraine has been using to pound Russian logistical and headquarters targets in other regions. The plant continues to operate and there are signs Russia is attempting to disconnect it from the Ukrainian grid and redirect its electrical power into Russia But Ukraine has not completely refrained from targeting missile batteries and other miliary units houses at Zaporizhzhia, raising international coverage of a nuclear meltdown sparked by an errant artillery round. Whatever the inherent dangers, the plant remains very visibly on the front line between two warring states and an object lesson about the limitations of risk planning.|
