<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The G20 nations can adopt multilateral constraints requiring international approval for military actions such as drone strikes to enforce laws and legitimize operations, ensuring shared responsibility and protection against civilian casualties <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Moreover, in response to escalating conflicts, they can unite to demand fact-based investigations and express condemnation or support through carefully negotiated joint declarations, as evidenced by their reactions to the situation in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

To prevent incidents from escalating into broader conflict, G20 nations can adopt measures such as enforcing multilateral constraints, which include stricter targeting protocols and an inclusive coordination process involving various countries to approve military actions, thus demonstrating shared responsibility and a participatory model of accountability <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. In response to crises, they can collectively agree to establish facts through calm and careful investigation before taking action, as exemplified by the emergency meeting called by US President Biden with NATO members following a missile strike during the G20 summit <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Additionally, G20 leaders can issue declarations that condemn acts of aggression and call for the withdrawal of forces, as seen in the draft declaration at the end of the Bali summit, although this must account for differing views among member states <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Furthermore, discussions on measures to limit the financial capabilities of aggressors, such as price caps on commodities, can be a collective approach to deter profiteering from conflicts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The recent G20 summit in Bali highlighted the importance of multilateral collaboration and the adoption of diplomatic measures to address and prevent incidents from escalating into broader conflicts. In response to a missile strike in Poland, US President Biden convened an emergency meeting with NATO members, emphasizing the need for a calm and careful investigation to establish facts before taking any action <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This approach aligns with the participatory model of accountability discussed in the context of drone warfare, where multilateral constraints and international approval are sought to legitimize operations and protect against civilian casualties, suggesting a framework that G20 nations could adopt to prevent escalation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the G20 leaders' draft declaration condemning the war in Ukraine and the joint statements at both the G20 and APEC summits illustrate a shared commitment to addressing conflict through unified messaging and careful consideration of actions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The agreement brokered by Turkey and the UN to secure Ukrainian grain transport via the Black Sea is an example of urgent actions being taken to address global challenges arising from conflicts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Additionally, G20 leaders, including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, have emphasized the importance of working together with allies to mitigate the economic consequences of conflicts and to provide a counterpoint to authoritarian regimes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. These instances demonstrate a collective effort to use diplomatic channels and international cooperation to manage and prevent conflicts, which can serve as a model for G20 nations in dealing with similar incidents in the future <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

The purpose of requiring international approval for drone strikes, especially through the United Nations, is to enforce laws and norms that help to legitimize operations.72 Strikes conducted under multilateral constraints typically demonstrate a shared responsibility among countries to protect against civilian casualties.73 Multilateral constraints relate to a "participatory" model of accountability, wherein "the performance of power-wielders is evaluated by those who are affected by their actions. "74 In the context of drone warfare, multilateral constraints consist of stricter targeting protocols, which are enforced during an inclusive coordination process involving political officials, military representatives, and operational commanders from numerous countries. This results in a negotiated process, usually through a regional or international coalition of cooperating countries, to approve the use of strikes based on their anticipated military advantages.|

The morning following the missile strike, US President Biden called for an emergency meeting with present NATO members. From this discussion, leaders emerged with a united message: before any action is taken, facts must first be established through a calm and careful investigation. A few hours later, Polands president announced that the rocket which had struck Poland had not originated from Russia but from Ukraines air defense system.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> But the draft also said, "There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions," reflecting the divisions among G20 states over Russia.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/16/emmanuel-macron-visit-xi-jinping-ukraine-china-mediating-role" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 16th, 2022</div></div>| A draft declaration issued from G20 leaders at the close of the summit said "most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine" and demanded Russias "complete and unconditional withdrawal" from its neighbours territory. The reference to war is a rejection of Russias claim that it is involved in a "special military operation". But the draft also said, "There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions," reflecting the divisions among G20 states over Russia. China and India have both refrained from outright criticism of the Kremlins invasion.|

"Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy," the joint statement read. But, it added that "there were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions." The statement uses almost identical phrasing to the G20 declaration that was made two days earlier in Bali, Indonesia.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> "We therefore commit to taking urgent actions to save lives, prevent hunger and malnutrition, particularly to address the vulnerabilities of developing countries, and call for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems and supply chains," they said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/globe-and-mail-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-g20-indonesia-ukraine-russia/" target="_blank">The Globe and Mail</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Nov 16th, 2022</div></div>| The focus on Ukraine proved frustrating for some G20 countries, which would have preferred prioritizing economic matters, particularly given the ongoing ramifications of the pandemic. In their statement, G20 leaders said they were "deeply concerned by the challenges to global food security exacerbated by current conflicts and tensions." "We therefore commit to taking urgent actions to save lives, prevent hunger and malnutrition, particularly to address the vulnerabilities of developing countries, and call for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems and supply chains," they said. Part of that includes an agreement brokered by Turkey and the United Nations to secure the transport of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea.|

"Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy," it said. "There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions." The passing of the joint declaration would have required the buy-in from leaders that share close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin most notably Xi, who declared a "no-limits" friendship between their countries weeks before the invasion, and Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi.|
