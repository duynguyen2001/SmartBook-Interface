The conflict in Ukraine has significantly heightened concerns for nuclear safety and security, particularly with the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe's largest, falling under Russian control and experiencing shelling, which has raised the specter of a major nuclear disaster reminiscent of the 1986 Chornobyl meltdown <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Although radiation levels have remained normal, the repeated shelling and threats to power infrastructure, which are essential for cooling and safety systems of nuclear plants, pose serious risks, as evidenced by emergency generators being activated at ZNPP and other Ukrainian nuclear facilities following blackouts caused by Russian strikes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed grave concerns over the integrity of ZNPP and has not recognized the illegal Russian seizure or operation of the plant, urging Russia to withdraw its claims and personnel <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Furthermore, Russia's occupation of ZNPP not only presents a direct risk to the environment and nuclear safety but also represents a strategic control over a major source of Ukrainian energy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has significantly impacted the country's nuclear safety and security, with the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP)—Europe's largest—being a major concern due to its occupation by Russian forces and repeated shelling. The plant, along with Ukraine's other nuclear facilities, requires a stable electricity supply to maintain vital cooling and safety systems, and disruptions to the power grid from shelling have forced these plants to rely on emergency diesel generators <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed grave concerns regarding the integrity of ZNPP and the safety risks to all Ukrainian nuclear facilities in the war, calling for Russia to withdraw its personnel and cease its baseless claims of ownership <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Moreover, the repeated disconnection of Ukrainian nuclear plants from the national grid, including ZNPP, Rivne, and Khmelnytskyy, has resulted in the most extensive loss of off-site power since the conflict began, raising the risk of a serious nuclear accident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The IAEA has emphasized the need for secure off-site power and has taken a strong stance against the illegal Russian seizure and operation of ZNPP, with Director General Rafael Grossi highlighting the precarious and challenging situation and the potential for a nuclear emergency <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The EU and the UK have contributed funds to help restore power supplies, acknowledging the critical importance of keeping nuclear plants operational and safe even amidst the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Nuclear plants supply power to the grid when operating, but when shut down they actually draw power from it in order to run vital cooling and safety systems, which means disruption to electricity supply is a major concern.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2348196-ukraines-nuclear-plants-face-uncertain-future-after-russian-attacks/" target="_blank">newscientist.com</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), near the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar, is Europes largest nuclear power station and has been in Russian hands since in March. The final working reactor at ZNPP was shut down in September as a precautionary measure. Nuclear plants supply power to the grid when operating, but when shut down they actually draw power from it in order to run vital cooling and safety systems, which means disruption to electricity supply is a major concern. On 23 November, shelling of power infrastructure in Ukraine by Russian troops led to blackouts that caused emergency diesel generators to start up at ZNPP, as well as at reactors across Ukraines three other nuclear plants that had previously made it through the war with relatively little disruption.|
