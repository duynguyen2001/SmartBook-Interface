The Black Sea Grain Initiative, an agreement involving Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the UN, is facing delays due to a backlog of over 150 ships, prompting the United Nations to call for urgent measures to prevent further disruptions to supply chains and port operations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The delays, caused by the slow inspection process of ships carried out by the Joint Coordination Centre, are of significant concern as they have the potential to disrupt the supply chain, affecting the global transportation of grain and other foodstuffs from Ukrainian ports <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. In response, the Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister emphasized the need for faster ship inspections to increase the export volume and prevent further queues <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>However, Russia's suspension of its participation in the initiative "for an indefinite period" raises questions about the future of this critical agreement <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. With the deal set to expire and uncertainty about its renewal, the potential disruption to the grain supply could have global consequences, particularly for food security in developing countries <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. While contingency plans were not explicitly detailed in the provided contexts, the urgency expressed by the UN and infrastructure officials suggests that discussions and efforts are likely underway to address these potential disruptions and find solutions to maintain the flow of grain exports <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The damage to Africa should be of supreme concern to all nations, they write, because in an interconnected world, leaving countries to the mercy of environmental shocks creates instability that has severe consequences for all nations. They argue that achieving the $100bn a year climate finance target is now "globally critical if we are to forestall the systemic risks of leaving societies in crisis," and say additional resources for loss and damage must now also be introduced. They acknowledge that some progress has already been made, including early warning systems and infrastructure to defend against extremes, but point out that frontline nations are not compensated for impacts from a crisis they did not cause.|

Even efficient tea producers will struggle to stay competitive under existing and future market conditions, which include persistently low pricing, growing input costs, and destructive climate change consequences, and the SDG gap in tea-producing regions of Northern India will widen. Sustainability certificates are ill-equipped to address these problems. The way forward is sustained collective action by STGs and RTGs to establish a pre-competitive platform with a common fund to address climate-adaptive tea production, a greater role for premier producers organisations in marketing value-added quality tea in India and abroad.|
