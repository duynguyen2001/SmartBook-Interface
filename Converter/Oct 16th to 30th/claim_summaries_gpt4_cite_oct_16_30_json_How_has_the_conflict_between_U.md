|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The 2022 strategy is largely a continuation of the 2018 National Defense Strategy under then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, which made a fundamental shift away from primarily countering extremists to focusing first on a potential war with a near-peer competitor.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/voice-america" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/china-remains-top-threat-in-new-national-defense-strategy/6808577.html" target="_blank">Voice of America (VOA)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 27th, 2022</div></div>| However, according to the report, "Iran does not today possess a nuclear weapon" and the U.S. "currently believe[s] it is not pursuing one."

|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> The bottom line is more that key decision-makers on both sides view the war as an all-or-nothing struggle with far-reaching global implicationsworsening the risk of dangerous escalation the longer it lasts.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/foreign-policy-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/10/18/ukraine-is-the-worlds-foreign-policy-rorschach-test/" target="_blank">Foreign Policy</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 18th, 2022</div></div>| If Putin sees the world the same way that Western hawks do, then he believes defeat in Ukraine would consign Russia to the second rank of world powers, make China question Russias value as an ally, reinforce U.S. global dominance, and quite possibly threaten his regime and personal survival. And he may still hold out hope that a compromise for peace, which kept Ukraine from becoming a de facto Western ally and struck a blow against what he sees as a U.S.-led effort to weaken Russia, would vindicate his original decision to go to war and justify the enormous price that Russia has paid for his miscalculations and incompetence. The bottom line is more that key decision-makers on both sides view the war as an all-or-nothing struggle with far-reaching global implicationsworsening the risk of dangerous escalation the longer it lasts.

However, despite the increasing foreign exchange flow to Central Asian countries, the large-scale war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia lead to uncertainties and complicate forecasts, which may cause unexpected risks for the Central Asian economies in the future. After sanctions, the deterioration of the business environment resulted in instability for labor migrants and caused an unbalanced flow of remittances.|
