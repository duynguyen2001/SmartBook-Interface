## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey, allowed the resumption of grain exports from Ukraine's blockaded ports, with Ukraine exporting 8 million tons of food by sea since July <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. However, Russia's recent suspension of its participation in the agreement, citing an alleged Ukrainian drone attack, has called into question the possibility of maintaining these vital maritime routes for grain exports <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Before the conflict, Ukraine was a significant exporter of wheat and corn, contributing substantially to global trade, but the conflict's maritime blockades in the Black Sea severely disrupted these exports <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The Black Sea Grain Initiative brokered by the UN and Turkey succeeded in partially lifting the blockade, allowing the safe transit of grain, which has been critical in mitigating the global food crisis <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, the recent suspension of Russia's participation in this initiative, due to alleged Ukrainian drone attacks, has jeopardized the movement of grain and could lead to a reinstatement of the blockade, raising concerns about the continuity of grain exports from Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. With the future of the Black Sea corridor in doubt, and the original agreement set to expire soon, finding alternative maritime routes has become imperative to sustain Ukrainian grain exports and support global food security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Black Sea Grain Initiative, a critical agreement brokered by the UN and Turkey, allowed Ukraine to resume grain exports through Black Sea ports, which had been blocked since the Russian invasion on February 24. The deal, which was set to expire on November 19, played a significant role in alleviating the global food crisis by enabling the export of over 9 million tons of Ukrainian grain, thereby contributing to the reduction of soaring global food prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Despite the benefits, Russia suspended its participation in the initiative, citing an alleged Ukrainian drone attack on its Black Sea Fleet, creating uncertainty about the future of the grain corridor and potentially impacting global food supplies once again <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In response to the potential disruption of grain exports from Ukraine, there is a growing interest in establishing alternative maritime routes to mitigate the impact. Australia, for example, is poised to become a key wheat supplier as concerns over the future of the Black Sea grain corridor increase. The country is expected to see rising demand for its wheat, even though there are concerns about the crop's quality due to forecasted showers that might affect grain filling <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. However, with Ukrainian ports operating at only 25% to 30% of their capacity in the days preceding the suspension, the need for alternative routes is underscored <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. As the situation evolves, the international community may need to explore and secure such alternatives to ensure the continuity of grain exports and to support global food security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.
