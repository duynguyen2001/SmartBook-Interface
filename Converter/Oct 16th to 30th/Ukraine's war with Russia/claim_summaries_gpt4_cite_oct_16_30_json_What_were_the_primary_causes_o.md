The Ukraine-Russia crisis escalated into a full-scale war due to several contributing factors. Initially, the rapid economic recovery post-pandemic led to tightening energy markets, which were further exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, causing a global energy crisis with soaring natural gas prices and electricity costs <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The situation deteriorated as Russian President Vladimir Putin employed escalation as a strategic response to Ukrainian counter-offensives, which had begun to reverse Russian advances <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite the international community's efforts to prevent nuclear escalation and Russia's military setbacks, the Biden administration maintained a stance of non-engagement with Putin, insisting that peace negotiations were contingent on Ukraine's decision, even in the face of international pressure for diplomatic solutions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The Ukraine-Russia crisis escalated into a full-scale war in 2022 primarily due to Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine. This act of aggression was carried out despite Kremlin's previous denials of any plans to invade, thus proving their assurances unreliable <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The invasion caused a spike in global commodities prices, affecting terms of trade and currency values in Asia, and had a direct impact on global energy markets by driving the price of natural gas to record highs, thereby exacerbating a global energy crisis that had been tightening since 2021 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The conflict further strained international relations, with Russian President Vladimir Putin employing escalation as a cornerstone strategy, particularly in the face of Ukrainian counter-offensives that rolled back Russian gains <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>As the war continued, Putin resorted to implied threats of nuclear weapons use, a move that was met with unified support for Ukraine by the United States, G7 nations, NATO, and the EU, all of whom condemned the Russian aggression and its threats to global security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The use of such brinksmanship tactics by Russia, alongside the economic impacts of the conflict, including disruptions in remittances for countries reliant on Russia and significant uncertainties for global economies, revealed the multifaceted reasons behind the escalation of the crisis into a major conflict in 2022 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The international community's response to the invasion and the subsequent economic sanctions on Russia further intensified the situation, confirming the war's transition from a regional crisis to a significant geopolitical event with worldwide repercussions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

The rise in global CO2 emissions this year would be much larger more than tripling to reach close to 1 billion tonnes were it not for the major deployments of renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles (EVs) around the world. Even though the energy crisis sparked by Russias invasion of Ukraine has propped up global coal demand in 2022 by making natural gas far more expensive, the relatively small increase in coal emissions has been considerably outweighed by the expansion of renewables. Global energy trends have also been affected this year by the impacts of Russias war on the world economy, which have significantly dampened expectations for economic growth, notably in Europe.|

The Biden administration has resisted engaging with Putin to end the conflict, saying it is up to Kyiv to decide whether it wants to negotiate with Russia. The letter acknowledges difficulties in engaging with Russia, criticizing its "outrageous and illegal invasion of Ukraine" and "illegal annexations." The progressives then argue that the U.S. has a responsibility to "pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine."|

Therefore, easing the situation in Ukraine via diplomacy instead of cruel military means to avoid US resources from being further consumed fits the interests of the Democratic Party and the US.Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times that at the beginning, the progressives inside the Democratic Party had not voiced strong opposition to Biden's support of Ukraine, either out of the so-called shared values, hostility toward Russia or obligations to allies. But as the conflict continues, the negative impact on the US economy has driven them to suggest Biden change course.Xu Liang, an associate professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing International Studies University, believes that the letter signed by some progressives reflects the fact that inside the US, there are people who do not want the US to be dragged in the mud of war for long. However, the criticism the letter had drawn and its retraction show that in the US, "political correctness" dominates.For the US, it is politically correct to support Ukraine and sanction Russia.|
