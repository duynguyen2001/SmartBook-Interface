President Biden has expressed the necessity of a negotiated settlement to the conflict, reflecting a broader aspiration for a diplomatic resolution <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

Diplomatic efforts to resolve the Ukraine-Russia conflict have included calls by the US and European Union for a peaceful resolution, with the US expressing a desire for a negotiated settlement, as stated by President Biden <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The US, along with a coalition of 37 countries, has also applied sanctions aimed at isolating Russia and limiting its war efforts in Ukraine, with significant impacts on Russia's ability to access commodities, technologies, and software necessary for the war, as well as immobilizing approximately $300 billion of Russian Central Bank assets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Despite these efforts, the US has been criticized for not engaging constructively in the conflict and for quashing diplomatic voices calling for proactive negotiations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>, with the situation further complicated by accusations that Iran has supplied drones to Russia in violation of UN resolutions, an allegation which Iran denies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The lack of serious diplomatic efforts to end the conflict has been worrisome, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warning of the dangers of escalation and the potential use of nuclear weapons by Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Some US officials and commentators have advocated for direct diplomacy and a compromise similar to historical precedents like the Cuban Missile Crisis, while others emphasize the importance of Ukrainian victory as a prerequisite for diplomacy and the eventual conclusion of war <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Additionally, complications in international relations have arisen, as seen with the US's strained relationship with Saudi Arabia following a disagreement over oil production levels, which has been perceived as a move that benefits Russia in its war against Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

## Claims

|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="1"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Tehran denies supplying the drones to Russia and earlier this week said it was ready for "dialogue and negotiation with Ukraine to clear these allegations" after Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine should break diplomatic ties with Tehran.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/20/russia-iran-defiant-amid-un-pressure-over-ukraine-drones" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 20th, 2022</div></div>| The US and European Union say they have evidence that Iran supplied Russia with Shahed-136s, low-cost drones that explode on landing. Washington says any arms transfer was in contravention of UN Security Council Resolution 2231 which is part of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a now moribund deal to curb Irans nuclear activities and prevent the country from developing a nuclear weapon. Tehran denies supplying the drones to Russia and earlier this week said it was ready for "dialogue and negotiation with Ukraine to clear these allegations" after Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine should break diplomatic ties with Tehran. On Wednesday, Irans UN envoy, Amir Saeid Iravani, rejected the "unfounded and unsubstantiated claims" on the drone transfers and said that Tehran, which has abstained in votes on the war, wanted a "peaceful resolution" of the conflict, which began when Russia sent its troops into Ukraine on February 24.|

He was explicit about that goal in a speech he made in Delaware in June. Biden said: "It appears to me that, at some point along the line, theres going to have to be a negotiated settlement here. And what that entails, I dont know."|

This years expected improvement contrasts with what happened following the 2008 global financial crisis, which saw strong deteriorations in the CO2 intensity of energy supply for several years after the initial economic shock. "The global energy crisis triggered by Russias invasion of Ukraine has prompted a scramble by many countries to use other energy sources to replace the natural gas supplies that Russia has withheld from the market. The encouraging news is that solar and wind are filling much of the gap, with the uptick in coal appearing to be relatively small and temporary," said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.|

There is no room for compromise. Since the Ukraine crisis, the US has kept instigating other countries to strengthen sanctions on Russia and expand military assistance to Ukraine, which shows the US has no will to play a constructive role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As a result, voices that called for a proactive diplomatic push were quashed right away.|

As Ukraines leader put it, this is "very dangerous". With the dangers of escalation mounting alongside the death toll the absence of serious diplomatic efforts to end the conflict is both striking and worrying. For some of Ukraines most ardent backers, even talking about diplomacy amounts to appeasement.|

He wants us to face the prospect of a great superpower war. His solution is to have secret diplomacy, as we did during Cuban Missile Crisis, and have a direct compromise between the United States and Russia. But theres no strategic standoff here.|

All champions of democracy over autocracywhether they call themselves progressives, conservatives or liberalsshould be doing whatever we can to ensure that Ukraine wins this just war as quickly as possible. Diplomacy by the Biden administration will inevitably follow as sustained diplomacy always marks the conclusion of wareven with tyrants and despots. But first Ukraine must winlet us continue to unite as Americans and focus on that central and historic imperative."|

This robust global coalition reinforces U.S. efforts to isolate Russia from commodities, technologies, and software necessary for Putins war. Furthermore, sanctions (administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury) are having a significant impact on Russias ability to wage its unjust war against Ukraine. Specifically, sanctions implemented by the United States along with Allies and partners and allies have immobilized about $300 billion worth of Russian Central Bank assets, limiting the central banks ability to aid the war effort and mitigate sanctions impacts.|

"Russia deepening an alliance with Iran is something the whole world, especially those in the region and across the world, frankly, should be seeing as a profound threat," he said. Asked for comment, the Iranian mission to the United Nations repeated a statement issued by the government on Friday that said it supports upholding the UN Charter and the UNs attempts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine. The Kremlin has not commented.|

But earlier this month, Saudi Arabia and Russia steered a group of oil-producing countries in voting to slash oil production by two million barrels per day, the opposite of the outcome the administration thought it had secured as the Democratic Party struggles to deal with inflation and high gas prices heading into the November elections. The move led angry Biden administration officials to reassess Americas relationship with the kingdom and produced a flurry of accusatory statements between the two governments including a charge by the White House that Saudi Arabia was helping Russia in its war in Ukraine. Lawmakers who had been told about the trips benefits in classified briefings and other conversations that included details of the oil deal which has not been previously disclosed and was supposed to lead to a surge in production between September and December have been left fuming that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman duped the administration.|
