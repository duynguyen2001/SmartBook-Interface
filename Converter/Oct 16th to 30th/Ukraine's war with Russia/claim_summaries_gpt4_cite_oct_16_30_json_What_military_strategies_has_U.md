Ukraine has demonstrated resilience in defending against Russian aggression by launching relentless attacks to reclaim territory, notably targeting the province of Kherson which Russia annexed after sham referendums <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Utilizing US-supplied HIMARS rocket launchers, Ukrainian forces have strategically struck key infrastructure such as a bridge on the Dnieper and a dam in Kherson, disrupting Russian supply lines and forcing them to rely on less secure pontoons and ferries <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. In response to Russian aerial assaults, Ukraine's air defenses have proven effective, intercepting and shooting down many Iranian-supplied drones and limiting the impact of Russia's use of limited-precision munitions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Moreover, the creation of territorial defense forces in the annexed regions indicates a preparation for a protracted defense and the possibility of countering Russian attempts to conscript Ukrainians to fight against their own country <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
Ukraine has employed a variety of military strategies to counteract Russian aggression, focusing on both defensive and offensive tactics. To disrupt Russian supply lines and hinder their forces' movements, Ukrainian troops have launched relentless attacks to reclaim parts of the Kherson province, utilizing US-supplied HIMARS rocket launchers to target strategic points such as bridges and dams in the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. These strikes have effectively forced Russia to rely on less stable means like pontoons and ferries for transportation, which have also been targeted by Ukrainian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Additionally, Ukraine's air defenses have been successful in intercepting and shooting down many of the Iranian-supplied drones and limited-precision munitions used by Russia, indicating a robust and strategic use of their defensive capabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In response to Russia's tactics and the annexation of territories, Ukraine has adapted its strategies to meet the changing dynamics of the war. The Ukrainian military has continued their counteroffensives in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, aiming to regain control over occupied areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Moreover, to protect vital infrastructure, Ukraine has had to redistribute its air defense systems away from the front lines to shield power facilities from Russian attacks, demonstrating a strategic reallocation of resources in the face of new threats <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This reallocation, however, has created a gap in their defenses, as they currently lack sufficient air defense systems to cover all necessary areas, giving Russia a temporary advantage in air attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Despite this, Ukraine remains determined in its defense and has been receiving ongoing support from the West, including the provision of weapons and defense systems to bolster its capabilities against Russian aggression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

But increasingly overt nuclear threats are also likely. The actual use of tactical nuclear weapons cannot be excluded. The frequency with which western leaders make reference to this and talk about possible responses the latest to do so was Frances Emmanuel Macron is a sign of the briefings they are getting in private.|

During the summer, Ukrainian troops launched relentless attacks to reclaim parts of the province, also called Kherson, which is one of the four regions that Russia illegally annexed after sham referendums last month. Ukraine has used US-supplied HIMARS rocket launchers to repeatedly hit a key bridge on the Dnieper in Kherson and a large dam upstream, also used as a crossing point. The strikes have forced Russia to rely on pontoons and ferries, also targeted by Ukraine.|

From a military sense, Russias use of the Iranian-supplied drones and Kalibr and Iskander cruise missiles against Ukrainian infrastructure is a "very poor use of limited-precision munitions," Clark said. The Russians are struggling with dwindling supplies of these high-end weapons, he said, adding that a more strategic move would be to save them for the battlefield, because Ukraines air defenses have succeeded in intercepting and shooting down many of the drones. "Its a waste by the Russians of very expensive and limited systems in an attempt to likely achieve a terror effect that isnt going to sway the Ukrainian government or population," Clark said.|

Russia took Kherson in the early days of the war, but recently it has come under pressure as Ukrainian troops advance. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was seen on Russian TV saying that the aim of the drill was for military command and control to practise carrying out "a massive nuclear strike by the strategic nuclear forces in retaliation for the enemy's nuclear strike". A Yars inter-continental ballistic missile was launched from Plesetsk cosmodrome, some 800km (500 miles) north of Moscow, and a Sineva ballistic missile was fired from the Barents Sea to the remote Kura test site in Kamchatka province in Russia's Far East, the Kremlin said.|

Martial law in the four annexed territories would allow the authorities to impose curfews, seize property, imprison undocumented immigrants, establish checkpoints, detain people for up to 30 days and forcibly resettle residents to another region. The president also ordered the creation of territorial defense forces, a type of civilian militia, in the four annexed regions, raising the possibility that Moscows forces may try to conscript Ukrainians to fight their own countrys forces, part of a broader effort to mobilize hundreds of thousands of new fighters as its forces suffer huge casualties. Mr. Putin has grappled with growing anger at home over his call-up of about 300,000 reservists to fight in the war.|

To delay the Ukrainian counteroffensive as the Russians complete their retreat, Moscow has left newly mobilised, inexperienced forces on the other side of the wide river, it added. The troop movements come as the Ukrainian military said its forces have continued their counteroffensives in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. The ISW think tank also said Sunday that Russias latest war strategy of targeting power plants in recent days appears to be aimed at diminishing Ukrainians will to fight and forcing Ukraines government to spend additional resources to protect civilians and energy infrastructure.|

A classified version of the report was released to Congress earlier this year. Another senior defense official, also speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity Thursday, said nuclear weapons would continue to be the "bedrock" of U.S. military deterrence. According to the official, the new defense strategy reflects that the U.S. is now facing two major nuclear-armed competitors in Russia and China.|

Moreover, Ukraine had to pull air defense systems from the front lines to protect its power infrastructure across a greater territory. At this point, Ukraine lacks sufficient air defense systems, and Russia now has an advantage in pursuing air attacks after buying Iranian Shahed-136 "kamikaze" drones, which are more like single-use missiles.

The Administration has deep concerns about the conflict escalating, Austin said, but remains committed to continuing to support Ukraine with weapons and the means to defend itself. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly discussed the possible use of nuclear weapons in the eight-month-old war and this week observed nuclear drills, called Grom or "Thunder" exercises, involving Russian submarines, bombers and ballistic missile launches inside Russia. Austin shot-down speculation that the war games were subterfuge for a real nuclear attack, saying U.S. intelligence had not observed any indication that such preparations were taking place.|

The administration initially planned to release the strategy in February; that delay also encompassed the defense strategy. The National Defense Strategys centerpiece is "integrated deterrence," or coordinating military, diplomatic and economic levers from across the U.S. government to deter an adversary from taking an aggressive action. But it also stresses "campaigning" to build up the capability of international coalitions and complicate adversaries actions.|
