## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Import-dependent countries can establish diversified supply chains and build strategic grain reserves to reduce reliance on single sources, as delays under the Black Sea Grain Initiative indicate potential disruptions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Additionally, these countries can invest in local agriculture and pursue bilateral trade agreements to secure alternative grain supplies, considering the export bans and predicted shortages from traditional suppliers like Ukraine and Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Import-dependent countries, recognizing the risks of disruptions to grain supplies due to factors such as the Russian export ban on wheat and potential crop failures in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>, must consider developing contingency plans. Such plans could involve diversifying their sources of grain to reduce reliance on any single supplier <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Additionally, countries could invest in strategic grain reserves to buffer against temporary shortages and price spikes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The establishment of a pre-competitive platform with a common fund to address climate-adaptive tea production, as suggested for tea producers, could be adapted to the grain sector to enhance resilience against climate change and other market challenges <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Furthermore, ensuring efficient inspection processes as noted by the Joint Coordination Center could prevent delays and maintain steady supplies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

Import-dependent countries face significant risks to their food security due to disruptions in grain supplies, as evidenced by the reliance of nations like Benin, Somalia, and Egypt on wheat exports from Ukraine and Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The Black Sea Grain Initiative, brokered by the UN and Turkey, was crucial in easing the blockade and facilitating safe corridor navigation for ships carrying grain from Ukraine, thus helping to mitigate global food shortages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, the initiative is at risk due to delays and the backlog of ship inspections, with over 150 vessels waiting, potentially causing supply chain and port operation disruptions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. To combat these risks, import-dependent countries need to develop contingency plans that might include seeking alternative supply sources, investing in domestic agricultural resilience, and participating in international agreements that ensure the continuity of food supplies.<br/><br/>Such contingency plans could be supported by collective action from tea producer associations, which are suggested to transition into marketing associations to address issues such as low pricing, growing input costs, and climate change consequences <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the urgency of renewing the UN-led initiative is emphasized as a critical step for developing nations to maintain access to essential grain supplies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The involvement of international bodies like the Joint Coordination Centre for the Black Sea Grain Initiative plays a key role in ensuring safe maritime transportation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>, while the global community is encouraged to meet climate finance targets to support countries facing environmental shocks, which also affect food production and stability <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Therefore, by diversifying supply chains, enhancing agricultural practices, and ensuring international support and cooperation, import-dependent countries can better prepare for and mitigate the risks of grain supply disruptions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

Even efficient tea producers will struggle to stay competitive under existing and future market conditions, which include persistently low pricing, growing input costs, and destructive climate change consequences, and the SDG gap in tea-producing regions of Northern India will widen. Sustainability certificates are ill-equipped to address these problems. The way forward is sustained collective action by STGs and RTGs to establish a pre-competitive platform with a common fund to address climate-adaptive tea production, a greater role for premier producers organisations in marketing value-added quality tea in India and abroad.|

They argue that achieving the $100bn a year climate finance target is now "globally critical if we are to forestall the systemic risks of leaving societies in crisis," and say additional resources for loss and damage must now also be introduced. They acknowledge that some progress has already been made, including early warning systems and infrastructure to defend against extremes, but point out that frontline nations are not compensated for impacts from a crisis they did not cause. This is not only unfair, but also drives the spiral of global destabilisation, as nations pour money into responding to disasters, but can no longer afford to pay for greater resilience or to reduce the root problem through emissions reductions, they warn.|
