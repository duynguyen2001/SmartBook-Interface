<template v-slot:less-detailed>
A dirty bomb uses conventional explosives to disperse radioactive materials over a limited area, unlike a nuclear bomb's massive explosion and widespread radioactive fallout <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. While a dirty bomb's primary threat is contamination and panic rather than large-scale destruction, a nuclear weapon has the capacity to cause immense destruction and significant radiation over hundreds of square miles <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

A dirty bomb is a device that combines conventional explosives with radioactive material, intended to disperse the material upon explosion, rather than initiating a nuclear reaction <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Unlike a nuclear weapon, which can kill people and cause severe illness due to its immense explosive power and widespread radiation, a dirty bomb's primary aim is to contaminate an area and create panic, with its radiological effects being much more localized <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The radiation from a dirty bomb is expected to spread only over a few blocks or miles, significantly less than the hundreds of square miles affected by a nuclear blast <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite these differences, the suggestion of the use of a dirty bomb in conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine situation, highlights the concern for potential "nuclear terrorism" and the severe consequences of land contamination <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
A dirty bomb, also known as a radiological dispersal device (RDD), is a weapon that combines conventional explosives with radioactive material, designed to contaminate an area with radiation rather than cause widespread destruction through blast effects <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Unlike a nuclear weapon, which leverages nuclear fission or fusion to release massive amounts of energy and has the capability to cause immense immediate destruction and long-term radioactive fallout over hundreds of square miles, a dirty bomb is primarily intended to spread fear and panic, and its physical effects are generally limited to a few square miles at most <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The radioactive materials used in a dirty bomb could be sourced from hospitals, nuclear power stations, or research laboratories, and do not require the high refinement necessary for nuclear bombs <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The potential impact of a dirty bomb is more psychological and localized, focusing on creating panic and rendering areas uninhabitable due to radiological contamination, rather than causing mass casualties <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. This type of device is often associated with acts of terrorism, since it is more accessible and easier to make compared to a nuclear bomb, and is designed to cause disruption rather than large-scale physical destruction <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. While the radiation from a dirty bomb could disperse over a few blocks or miles, causing some environmental contamination, it is not comparable to the widespread devastation and loss of life that would result from a nuclear explosion <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the use of such a bomb by a state actor is unlikely, as no military is known to have included dirty bombs in their arsenal, indicating their limited utility in conventional warfare <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> It doesn't need to contain highly refined radioactive material, as is used in a nuclear bomb.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-63373637" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| What is a dirty bomb? It is a bomb that contains radioactive material, such as uranium, which is scattered through the air when its conventional explosive detonates. It doesn't need to contain highly refined radioactive material, as is used in a nuclear bomb. Instead, it could use radioactive materials from hospitals, nuclear power stations or research laboratories.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Nuclear bombs, by comparison, have explosions that are millions of times more powerful, according to the NRC.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/voice-america" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-rejects-russia-s-dirty-bomb-claims-/6802549.html" target="_blank">Voice of America (VOA)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 24th, 2022</div></div>| A "dirty bomb" is a device that uses conventional explosives to scatter radioactive material. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission says most dirty bombs "would not release enough radiation to kill people or cause severe illness," but could create panic and contaminate property. Nuclear bombs, by comparison, have explosions that are millions of times more powerful, according to the NRC. Iran drones|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> They are not nuclear weapons and bear no resemblance to the atomic bombs used by the United States in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/24/dirty-bomb-russia-ukraine-war/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 24th, 2022</div></div>| For many, it has also raised the question: What is a dirty bomb? Dirty bombs are made of conventional explosives and radioactive material, designed to spread the material once they explode. They are not nuclear weapons and bear no resemblance to the atomic bombs used by the United States in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Dirty bombs are far less powerful: Their "radiation could be dispersed within a few blocks or miles of the explosion," according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> The differences are so extreme that the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has written that "A dirty bomb is in no way similar to a nuclear weapon."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/10/russia-says-ukraine-is-preparing-a-dirty-bomb-is-it-true-and-what-does-it-mean/" target="_blank">thebulletin.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 27th, 2022</div></div>| The effects of a dirty bomb depend on many variables, from the type of radioactive materials used, to the amount of smoke and debris in the air, to the proximity to the blast. In any case, the amount of land area that would be affected by a dirty bomb is a lot less than that of a nuclear bomb: A dirty bomb could spread radiation only over a few square miles, while a full-blown nuclear bomb would spread radiation over hundreds of square miles. The differences are so extreme that the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has written that "A dirty bomb is in no way similar to a nuclear weapon." Which is not to say that there is no cause for alarm.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> A dirty bomb is not a nuclear bomb but a conventional explosive device with radioactive materials, the explosion of which could turn swathes of land uninhabitable for decades.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/careless-threats-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-ukraine-war-and-the-dirty-bomb-talk/article66065668.ece" target="_blank">thehindu.com</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 28th, 2022</div></div>| Russias allegation that Ukraine was planning to launch a so-called dirty bomb shows how dramatically the Ukraine conflict has escalated. Russias Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu held talks with many of his global counterparts, including Rajnath Singh, accusing Ukraine of potential "nuclear terrorism". A dirty bomb is not a nuclear bomb but a conventional explosive device with radioactive materials, the explosion of which could turn swathes of land uninhabitable for decades. Ukraine and its western backers have rejected the Russian allegations, saying the Russians, who have suffered setbacks, are making unfounded claims for a false flag attack.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The weapons in question combine conventional explosives like dynamite with radioactive material like uranium.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-10-27-22/h_cb114a9a891c7d404633a1aac973afea" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 27th, 2022</div></div>| The results would be released to the agency's board of directors and the public as soon as possible, he added. What is a dirty bomb? The weapons in question combine conventional explosives like dynamite with radioactive material like uranium. They are often referred to as weapons for terrorists, not countries, as they're designed to spread fear and panic more than eliminate any military target.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Such a bomb is not a nuclear device; it has none of the explosive power of a nuclear weapon.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/politics/russia-dirty-bomb-west-ukraine.html" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Oct 24th, 2022</div></div>| The Russian defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, had claimed over the weekend that Ukraine was preparing to detonate a "dirty bomb, a phrase that describes a conventional explosive, like dynamite, that is wrapped with radiological waste. In a series of phone calls on Monday with NATO nations, Moscows top military commander, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, repeated the allegation. Such a bomb is not a nuclear device; it has none of the explosive power of a nuclear weapon. But it is an effective weapon of terror, and the resulting radiological contamination can make several city blocks uninhabitable for a period of time.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Such weapons don't have the devastating destruction of a nuclear explosion but could expose broad areas to radioactive contamination that could last for years.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-1.6629870" target="_blank">CBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| It was the first time Putin himself made the dirty bomb allegation. A dirty bomb uses explosives to scatter radioactive waste in an effort to sow terror. Such weapons don't have the devastating destruction of a nuclear explosion but could expose broad areas to radioactive contamination that could last for years. Western allies have dismissed as absurd the idea that Ukraine would contaminate its own land with toxic waste when Russia is on its back foot on the battlefield.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> A "dirty bomb" is not a nuclear bomb, and would be less harmful, but by using conventional explosives to spread radioactive material, it is an effective weapon of terror.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nato-russia-ukraine-dirty-bomb/" target="_blank">CBS News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| "Something bad" could be a "dirty bomb" an explosive loaded with radioactive material. Russia claims Ukraine wants to use one on the battlefield, although there is no evidence to support the allegation. A "dirty bomb" is not a nuclear bomb, and would be less harmful, but by using conventional explosives to spread radioactive material, it is an effective weapon of terror. Stoltenberg said the accusation could be a strategic tactic from Russia, foreshadowing what it aims to do instead.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Essentially, they are improvised bombs that use conventional high explosives to spread radioactive material into the surrounding area.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/us/politics/dirty-bomb-russia-ukraine.html" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Oct 25th, 2022</div></div>| The more formal name of the bombs radiological dispersal devices, or R.D.D. offers a fairly straightforward description of what these weapons are and how they work. Essentially, they are improvised bombs that use conventional high explosives to spread radioactive material into the surrounding area. But the fact that no military is known to have fielded one in its arsenal is a good indicator that they are not useful on the battlefield.|
