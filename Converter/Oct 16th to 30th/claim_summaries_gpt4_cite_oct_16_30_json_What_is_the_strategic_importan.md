# What is the strategic importance of the cities targeted by 'kamikaze' drone strikes, and how do these attacks align with Russia's broader military objectives?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The strategic importance of cities targeted by 'kamikaze' drone strikes like Kherson lies in their control over key routes and geographical features such as the land route to Crimea and the mouth of the Dnipro river, with Russia acknowledging the threat of Ukrainian advances <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. These attacks, largely focusing on civilian targets and infrastructure, align with Russia's military objectives to weaken Ukrainian resistance and maintain control over annexed regions despite the challenges posed by sanctions and depleted missile stocks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The strategic importance of cities targeted by 'kamikaze' drone strikes is highlighted by their location and military significance. Kherson, for instance, controls the only land route to Crimea and the mouth of the Dnipro river, making it a critical point for logistics and territorial control <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. These drone strikes, often utilizing loitering munitions like the Shahed-131 and 136, are part of Russia's efforts to compensate for the underperformance of its air force and the reduced availability of precision strike munitions, although their use has been primarily against civilian targets and infrastructure rather than military objectives <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Moreover, Crimea holds symbolic and strategic value for Russia, and the defense of this territory, including key cities like Sevastopol, aligns with Russia's broader military objectives to maintain control over annexed regions despite facing attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The strategic importance of the cities targeted by 'kamikaze' drone strikes, such as Kyiv, Dnipro, and Mykolaiv, is multifaceted. Kyiv, as Ukraine's capital, is central to the country's governance and morale, making it a symbolic target <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Dnipro and Mykolaiv are significant due to their locations and roles in the country's economy and infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Kherson, another key city, controls the only land route to the annexed Crimea peninsula and the mouth of the Dnipro River, making it vital for supply routes and strategic movements <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The attacks on critical infrastructure, particularly power stations, aim to cause blackouts and cripple the civilian infrastructure, exerting pressure on Ukraine's government and population <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>These attacks align with Russia's broader military objectives by attempting to weaken Ukraine's resolve and create a humanitarian crisis, thus indirectly impacting Ukraine's military capabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The use of 'kamikaze' drones, which are designed to be destroyed upon impact, illustrates a strategy to inflict damage while minimizing the risk to Russian personnel <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The focus on civilian targets and infrastructure, rather than military objectives, suggests a shift in tactics to terrorize the population, as military targets require precision that these drones lack <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This is consistent with the approach of Russia's new commander, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, known for his civilian-focused military strategies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Despite these efforts, experts contend that while the drone strikes increase casualties and damage, they are unlikely to change the overall course of the war <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

|---|---|---|
|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> They are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-10-17-22/h_acad2b553a31e40076c26c574aac3af3" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 17th, 2022</div></div>| Kamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system. They are known as a loitering munition because they are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only striking once an enemy asset is identified. They are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance. Why are they called "Kamikaze"?|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Kherson is one of four partially-occupied Ukrainian provinces that Russia claims to have annexed, and arguably the most strategically important.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-suicide-drones-strike-terror-ukraine-us-warns-war-crimes-2022-10-18/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 18th, 2022</div></div>| He appeared to concede that there was a danger of Ukrainian forces advancing towards the city of Kherson, which lies near the mouth of the Dnipro on the west bank, and is hard for Russia to resupply from the east because the main bridge across the Dnipro has been badly damaged by Ukrainian bombing. Russia captured the city largely unopposed in the early days of the invasion, and it remains the only major Ukrainian city that Moscow's forces have seized intact. Kherson is one of four partially-occupied Ukrainian provinces that Russia claims to have annexed, and arguably the most strategically important. It controls both the only land route to the Crimea peninsula Russia seized in 2014, and the mouth of the Dnipro.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Kherson is arguably the most strategically important of the annexed regions.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-commander-admits-situation-is-tense-his-forces-ukraine-2022-10-19/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| "The Ukrainian side is building up forces for a large-scale offensive," Vladimir Saldo, the official, told state TV. "Where the military operates, there is no place for civilians." Kherson is arguably the most strategically important of the annexed regions. It controls both the only land route to the Crimea peninsula Russia seized in 2014, and the mouth of the Dnipro, the 2,200-kilometre-long (1,367-mile) river that bisects Ukraine.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Russia is mainly using the Shahed loitering munitions to attack civilian targets and power infrastructure.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://ecfr.eu/article/no-loitering-what-russias-iranian-drones-could-mean-for-ukraine/" target="_blank">ecfr.eu</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 21st, 2022</div></div>| Alongside the Mohajer-6, Russia is using the Shahed-131 and 136 loitering munitions (renamed Geran 1 and 2 by the Russians) to make up for both the disappointing performance of its air force and the dwindling availability of long-range munitions capable of precision strikes. Stocks of these missiles have depleted considerably since the start of the war, and they could now be more difficult to produce because of Western sanctions on key electronic components. Russia is mainly using the Shahed loitering munitions to attack civilian targets and power infrastructure. Strikes on military objectives, including artillery and headquarters, have been the exception rather than the rule which could cast doubt on the strategic significance of these weapons in the strict operational sense.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Sevastopol is the largest city in the region and home to Russia's Black Sea fleet.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63437212" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Crimea was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and is extremely symbolic for Russian President Vladimir Putin. In recent weeks, several attacks have hit the peninsula, where the Russian army has built up a large presence. Sevastopol is the largest city in the region and home to Russia's Black Sea fleet. Mikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-installed governor of the city, said Russia's navy had repelled the latest attack - the "most massive" on the city since February.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The Russian pullback comes as Iranian-made drones pound civilian targets and infrastructure, a civilian terror campaign that has already damaged about 30 percent of the nations power-generating capabilities, according to Kyiv.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/politico-playbook-daily-briefing-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/19/ukraine-nato-russia-winter-equipment-00062596" target="_blank">Politico Playbook Daily Briefing</a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| Conversely, Russian forces continue to fall back, and even began evacuating up to 60,000 civilians to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Wednesday, a move that may be part of a larger Russian military retreat from the key city and the surrounding region. Vladimir Putin also declared martial law in the four Ukrainian districts he recently claimed to annex, a move that may allow for forced conscription there in the dwindling areas Russia still controls. The Russian pullback comes as Iranian-made drones pound civilian targets and infrastructure, a civilian terror campaign that has already damaged about 30 percent of the nations power-generating capabilities, according to Kyiv. The new Russian campaign is in keeping with its tactic of brutalizing the civilian population as its troops continue to suffer defeats on the battlefield, and is being orchestrated by Putins new commander, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, whose nickname of "General Armageddon" was earned in the brutal, civilian-focused air campaign in Syria.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Last Monday, in response to the explosion at the Kerch strait bridge into Crimea, Russia unleashed a deadly hail of missile and drone strikes aimed at Kyiv and other major cities.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/17/russia-targets-ukraines-energy-grid-as-winter-approaches" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 17th, 2022</div></div>| "Ultimately, they offer a way for Russia to cause more civilian and military casualties in Ukraine, but will not turn the tide of the war," he said. It is the second major attack on Kyiv in a week. Last Monday, in response to the explosion at the Kerch strait bridge into Crimea, Russia unleashed a deadly hail of missile and drone strikes aimed at Kyiv and other major cities. The bloody success of last weeks attack an estimated 15 were killed that day alone and the destruction of this Mondays, reveals the limitations in Kyivs air defence.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> As you mention there is no military utility to these attacks, this is about Putin satisfying hardliners in Russia they were in ecstasy last week after the missile attacks and probably will be after these ones," he said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/europe/kamikaze-drones-explained-update-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 17th, 2022</div></div>| Retired Australian Army Major General Mick Ryan told CNN the drones are "generally of limited utility against military targets that require precision." "So the Russians are using these fairly unsophisticated drones against large targets like cities. As you mention there is no military utility to these attacks, this is about Putin satisfying hardliners in Russia they were in ecstasy last week after the missile attacks and probably will be after these ones," he said. Drone attacks can have major impact on the civilian population.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Russia has used the drones and missiles to hit critical infrastructure around Ukraine in recent days, destroying almost a third of the country's power stations since Monday last week.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63329266" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Ukraine identified the drones - or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - used on Monday as Iranian Shahed-136 weapons. They are known as "kamikaze" drones because they are destroyed in the attack - named after the Japanese fighter pilots who flew suicide missions in World War Two. Russia has used the drones and missiles to hit critical infrastructure around Ukraine in recent days, destroying almost a third of the country's power stations since Monday last week. As a result, restrictions on electricity use were introduced in Ukraine for the first time on Thursday.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> But this week they have taken to the forefront, with dozens deployed daily to dive-bomb Kyiv, Dnipro and Mykolaiv, targeting Ukraines power infrastructure and causing blackouts across the country.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/los-angeles-times-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-10-21/drone-wars-iran-ukraine" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 21st, 2022</div></div>| Moments later comes the punch-boom of a deadly explosion. Small, propeller-driven drones were first used last month by Russia in its ongoing war on Ukraine. But this week they have taken to the forefront, with dozens deployed daily to dive-bomb Kyiv, Dnipro and Mykolaiv, targeting Ukraines power infrastructure and causing blackouts across the country. At least eight people have been killed in the strikes, Ukrainian authorities say.|
