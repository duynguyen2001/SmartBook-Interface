<template v-slot:more-detailed>
In response to Russian allegations that Ukraine is planning to employ a "dirty bomb," Ukrainian officials have taken a proactive stance to demonstrate their transparency on the matter. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has openly dismissed the accusations as baseless and has extended an invitation to the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the country and conduct inspections at its nuclear power facilities. This move is aimed at debunking Moscow's claims and showing that Ukraine has "nothing to hide" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#11">11</a>]</font>. Kuleba specifically requested that IAEA experts be "urgently sent" to peaceful facilities that Russia falsely claims are being used to develop such weapons, further underlining Ukraine's commitment to transparency <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>In addition to inviting UN inspectors, Ukraine has also garnered support from its Western allies, who have echoed Kyiv's denials and labeled Russia's accusations as "transparently false" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The IAEA has subsequently confirmed its intention to send inspectors to two Ukrainian sites, as mentioned in Russia's allegations, to carry out verifications of any undeclared nuclear activities and materials <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This approach by Ukraine, seeking to counter the narrative put forth by Russia, demonstrates a concerted effort to maintain credibility and international trust amidst the ongoing conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Kyiv has requested a team from the U.N.'s watchdog agency to inspect its nuclear power facilities in order to disprove Moscow's claims.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 25th, 2022</div></div>| Russia continues to press its allegation that Ukraine plans to use a so-called "dirty bomb" on its own territory, and says it will take it up with the United Nations. Ukrainian and Western officials have denounced the claim as a "pretext for aggression." Kyiv has requested a team from the U.N.'s watchdog agency to inspect its nuclear power facilities in order to disprove Moscow's claims. A "dirty bomb" is made to contaminate a large area with radioactivity, making it harmful or uninhabitable for residents there, without using a nuclear explosion.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Ukraine has invited experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit two facilities the Russian government says without evidence are involved in a plan to create a dirty bomb.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-10-27-22/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 27th, 2022</div></div>| Russia has been accusing Ukraine of planning to use a so-called dirty bomb, which combines conventional explosives like dynamite and radioactive material such as uranium. Kyiv and its Western allies say there is no truth to the accusation and that Moscow could be mounting a false-flag operation. Ukraine has invited experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit two facilities the Russian government says without evidence are involved in a plan to create a dirty bomb. More background: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the consequences for Russia if it uses a nuclear weapon in its war on Ukraine have been conveyed to Putin.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Without providing any evidence, Russia has accused Ukraine of plotting to use a "dirty bomb" - an explosive device mixed with radioactive material.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63404724" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| His government announced that ballistic and cruise missiles were launched in the Far East and Arctic. While the US was informed of the drills, they come at a time of heightened tensions with the West over his invasion of Ukraine. Without providing any evidence, Russia has accused Ukraine of plotting to use a "dirty bomb" - an explosive device mixed with radioactive material. Western countries have widely rejected those allegations as false, and Ukraine has warned that Moscow itself could be preparing such an attack.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> But Ukraine's allies - France, UK and the US - rejected Moscow's allegations as "transparently false".|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63392543" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Russia is sticking to its accusations that Ukraine is planning to use a dirty bomb - an explosive device containing radioactive material. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, made the claims, without evidence, to the UN security council. But Ukraine's allies - France, UK and the US - rejected Moscow's allegations as "transparently false". A dirty bomb is sometime called a weapon of mass disruption - just 9g (0.3z) of radioactive material with explosives would make the whole of Manhattan, New York uninhabitable for decades, according to the Federation of American Scientists.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Kuleba said Ukraine has always been transparent and has "nothing to hide."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/blinken-ukraine-dirty-bomb-shoigu/32097955.html" target="_blank">rferl.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 27th, 2023</div></div>| Ukraine earlier called the accusation that Kyiv was building a dirty bomb absurd, and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog accepted his request to send experts to Ukraine to refute Moscow's claim. Kuleba said he invited the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to "urgently send experts to peaceful facilities in Ukraine which Russia deceitfully claims to be developing a dirty bomb." Kuleba said Ukraine has always been transparent and has "nothing to hide." The IAEA said later on October 24 that it was preparing to send inspectors to two Ukrainian sites.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> To dismiss any thoughts of wrongdoing, Ukraine requested that the IAEA, the UNs nuclear watchdog, inspect the two nuclear locations in Ukraine that were mentioned in Russias accusations.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/10/russia-says-ukraine-is-preparing-a-dirty-bomb-is-it-true-and-what-does-it-mean/" target="_blank">thebulletin.org</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 27th, 2022</div></div>| Western officials quickly rejected the notion that Ukraine was preparing any such "false-flag operation" that would blame Russia. NATOs secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, denounced the Russian accusations, telling Politico in an interview that "The allegation that Ukraine is preparing to use dirty bombs in Ukraine is absurd." To dismiss any thoughts of wrongdoing, Ukraine requested that the IAEA, the UNs nuclear watchdog, inspect the two nuclear locations in Ukraine that were mentioned in Russias accusations. The inspections are intended to detect any possible undeclared nuclear activities and materials.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Ukraine has rejected the unsubstantiated accusation, and Western allies have dismissed it as "transparently false."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/voice-america" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/latest-developments-in-ukraine-oct-27/6807452.html" target="_blank">Voice of America (VOA)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 27th, 2022</div></div>| "We see no need for that," Putin said Thursday at a conference of international foreign policy experts, adding: "There is no point in that, neither political, nor military." Without offering evidence, he repeated Moscows claim that Ukraine was plotting to detonate a radioactive "dirty bomb" in a false flag attack blaming Russia. Ukraine has rejected the unsubstantiated accusation, and Western allies have dismissed it as "transparently false." Putin said Russia knows the Ukrainian facilities allegedly working on the purported project and asserted, again without providing proof, that Kyivs plan is to rig a missile with radioactive waste and blow it up, casting it as a Russian nuclear strike.|
