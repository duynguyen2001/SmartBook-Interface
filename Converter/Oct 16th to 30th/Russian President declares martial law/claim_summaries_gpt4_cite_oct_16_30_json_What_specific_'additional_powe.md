<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted regional leaders the authority to protect critical facilities, maintain public order, and enhance production for the war effort, as part of an "economic mobilisation" in regions adjoining Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. These powers could lead to restrictions on movement, detentions without trial, and tighter censorship, potentially bolstering Russia's military position and affecting civilian life in both annexed Ukrainian territories and bordering Russian regions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
Russian President Vladimir Putin declared martial law in four annexed Ukrainian regions and gave additional emergency powers to the heads of all Russian regions to protect critical facilities, maintain public order, and support the war effort through increased production <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. These powers could lead to restrictions on travel, public gatherings, tighter censorship, and expanded authority for law enforcement agencies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. A special coordinating council is to propose measures to enforce these new powers, although it is uncertain how much they will alter the situation for those already living under Russian control in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared martial law in the four regions of Ukraine that Russia annexed and has also granted emergency extra powers to the heads of all Russian regions. While the specifics of the martial law decree were not immediately detailed, they could potentially involve restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship, and more expansive powers for law enforcement agencies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Additionally, Putin's order allows regional leaders to protect critical facilities, maintain public order, and possibly increase production to support the war effort <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The measures are said to take effect from Thursday, with regions bordering Ukraine also experiencing heightened security levels to protect infrastructure, with authorities now having broad powers including restricted movement, search and seizure, and detention of individuals without charges for up to a month <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The impact of these additional powers on the situation on the ground might not immediately alter much for the populations in parts of Ukraine under Russian or proxy administration. However, in the bordering Russian regions, such as Crimea and others, the decree permits unspecified economic mobilization that could organize residents to support military and security services <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Furthermore, while the long-term effects on Russia's military position and public opinion remain unclear, the immediate enforcement is likely to result in much tighter security measures in the annexed regions. Ukraine and Western nations, which do not recognize the annexations, have condemned these moves, and Ukrainian officials have expressed skepticism about the changes altering the status quo significantly <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

Putin didn't immediately spell out the powers that martial law would grant. But they could include restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader powers for law enforcement agencies. Putin's order also opens the door for restrictive measures to be extended across Russia.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Putin conferred additional powers on the leaders of all Russia's 80-plus regions to protect critical facilities, maintain public order and increase production in support of the war effort.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-declares-martial-law-four-unilaterally-annexed-regions-ukraine-2022-10-19/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| The published Kremlin decree ordered an "economic mobilisation" in eight regions adjoining Ukraine, including Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014. It placed them in a special regime one step below martial law and allowed for the restriction of people's movements. Putin conferred additional powers on the leaders of all Russia's 80-plus regions to protect critical facilities, maintain public order and increase production in support of the war effort. But it was far from clear how fast or how effectively the new measures might bolster Russia's military position on the ground.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Russian President Vladimir Putin declared martial law Wednesday in the four regions of Ukraine that Moscow annexed and gave additional emergency powers to the heads of all regions of Russia.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/national-international/vladimir-putin-declares-martial-law-in-illegally-annexed-regions-of-ukraine/2887168/" target="_blank">nbcmiami.com</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| Russian President Vladimir Putin declared martial law Wednesday in the four regions of Ukraine that Moscow annexed and gave additional emergency powers to the heads of all regions of Russia. Putin didnt immediately spell out the steps that would be taken under martial law, but said his order was effective starting Thursday.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Putin provided few details of what martial law would entail, but restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader authority for law enforcement agencies are likely.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/usa-today-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/10/19/ukraine-russia-war-live-updates/10540340002/" target="_blank">USA TODAY Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| Russian President Vladimir Putin declared martial law Wednesday in the four regions of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed as Ukrainian troops continue their unrelenting drive to retain control of the occupied territories. Putin provided few details of what martial law would entail, but restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader authority for law enforcement agencies are likely. President Joe Biden called the tactic an intimidation attempt by Putin the "only tool available to him'' and said it won't work.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> But in a related decree, Putin announced heightened security levels extended to Russian regions bordering Ukraine to protect critical civilian and military infrastructure.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/first-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/19/1129853677/an-occupied-region-of-ukraine-is-evacuating-residents-to-russia" target="_blank">Up First</a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| A decree posted to the Kremlin website said a coalition of the government's defense and security agencies as well as a "special coordinating council" headed by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin would now have three days to come up with proposals to instill order. Analysts and Ukrainian officials say the decree may not change much on the ground for populations living in parts of Ukraine already administered by Russia's military or its proxies. But in a related decree, Putin announced heightened security levels extended to Russian regions bordering Ukraine to protect critical civilian and military infrastructure. The provision gives authorities broad new powers including the right to restricted movement around the country, search and seizure, and detention of individuals in prison for up to one month without charges or trial.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Draft legislation indicates it may involve restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader authority for law enforcement agencies.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/19/putin-declares-martial-law-in-annexed-regions-of-ukraine" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| Russian state agency TASS reported that the decree would be sent for approval to the Federation Council the upper house of Russias parliament and that the lower house State Duma would be informed of the decision. Putin did not provide details of the extra powers to be given to the heads of Russian regions under his decree, but said the order would be effective from Thursday. Draft legislation indicates it may involve restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader authority for law enforcement agencies. The annexation of the four partially occupied regions on September 30 came three days after the completion of Kremlin-orchestrated "referendums", which are largely regarded as having no validity by the international community.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> The order allows for unspecified economic mobilization in the regions, and it seemingly lays the groundwork to organize residents to support the military and security services.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-declares-martial-law-annexed-ukrainian-regions-rcna52926" target="_blank">NBC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Putin also signed an order Wednesday introducing new measures to Crimea, Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk, Rostov and other regions bordering Ukraine. Several of the regions, which have been important staging areas for Russias fight in Ukraine, have come under increasing Ukrainian fire in recent weeks. The order allows for unspecified economic mobilization in the regions, and it seemingly lays the groundwork to organize residents to support the military and security services. Much about the measures is vague, giving the state more legal room to maneuver.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> He told Russia's Security Council that it would give regional leaders additional powers to maintain social order and safeguard important facilities.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63311744" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The transfer or deportation of civilians by an occupying power from occupied territory is considered a war crime. In a separate development, Russia's Vladimir Putin said he had signed a decree imposing martial law on four Ukrainian regions, including Kherson, which Moscow annexed last month in a move rejected as illegal by the international community. He told Russia's Security Council that it would give regional leaders additional powers to maintain social order and safeguard important facilities. On Tuesday night, residents in Kherson started receiving text messages, urging them to evacuate immediately to avoid shelling of residential areas by Ukrainian forces.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> It remained unclear how fast or how effectively the new measures might bolster Russias military position on the ground, and what effect they would have on public opinion.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/19/putins-martial-law-all-you-need-to-know-in-under-500-words" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| The published Kremlin decree ordered an "economic mobilisation" in eight regions adjoining Ukraine, including occupied Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014. A Kyiv official said the decree would change nothing. It remained unclear how fast or how effectively the new measures might bolster Russias military position on the ground, and what effect they would have on public opinion. More restrictions|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> It was unclear what the immediate impact of Putin's declaration of martial law would be, beyond much tighter security measures in Kherson and the other three regions.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-commander-admits-situation-is-tense-his-forces-ukraine-2022-10-19/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| In televised remarks to his Security Council, Putin boosted the powers of Russia's regional governors and ordered the creation of a coordinating council under Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to support his "special military operation". He said the "entire system of state administration" must be geared to back up the Ukraine effort. It was unclear what the immediate impact of Putin's declaration of martial law would be, beyond much tighter security measures in Kherson and the other three regions. But Ukraine, which along with the West does not recognise Moscow's self-styled annexations, derided the move.|
