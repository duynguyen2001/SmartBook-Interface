President Vladimir Putin declared martial law in the four regions of Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed, with expectations of restrictions on travel and public gatherings, enhanced censorship, and expanded law enforcement authority <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. While specific details of the decree were not immediately provided, it is intended to bolster the stability of the economy, industry, and support Russia's military efforts in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The decree also grants emergency powers to Russian regional heads and restricts movement in and out of regions adjacent to Ukraine, suggesting a potential for broader application of these measures across Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. A separate decree calls for heightened security in Russian regions bordering Ukraine, authorizing broad powers such as restricted movement, search and seizure, and detention without trial <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. These measures appear to extend and formalize the restrictions already experienced by Ukrainians in the occupied territories <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
President Vladimir Putin has declared martial law in four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The decree for martial law, which came into effect on Thursday, includes measures such as restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship, and broader powers for law enforcement agencies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Additionally, it grants extra emergency powers to the heads of all Russian regions, requires law enforcement agencies to submit specific proposals within three days, and orders the creation of territorial defense forces in the annexed regions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. This martial law decree also introduces a "medium alert level" in certain Russian regions, including Crimea and Krasnodar Territory, which could lead to restricted movement and transportation as well as the "temporary resettlement of residents to safe areas" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The newly imposed restrictions under martial law are expected to tighten security checks and limit movement within the affected areas, building upon the already curtailed rights and freedoms of Ukrainians living under Russian occupation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The decree provides a vague framework that gives the Russian state more legal room to maneuver, allowing for economic mobilization in regions bordering Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font> and conferring additional powers on regional leaders to protect critical facilities and support the war effort <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. This represents a significant escalation from the previous legal status in the annexed regions, which are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine and have been administered by Russia's military or its proxies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The introduction of martial law follows a pattern of tightening control over Russian society, which began with the suppression of independent media and continued with partial mobilization <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

Putin provided few details of what martial law would entail, but restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader authority for law enforcement agencies are likely. President Joe Biden called the tactic an intimidation attempt by Putin the "only tool available to him'' and said it won't work.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Putin did not immediately spell out the steps that would be taken under martial law, but said the measures were intended to increase the stability of the economy, industry and production in support of Russias special military operation in Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/19/putin-declares-martial-law-in-annexed-regions-of-ukraine" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| Russias president did not provide details of the extra powers the heads of annexed regions will have under his decree. Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared martial law in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia, four regions of Ukraine that Russia proclaimed as annexed last month. Putin did not immediately spell out the steps that would be taken under martial law, but said the measures were intended to increase the stability of the economy, industry and production in support of Russias special military operation in Ukraine. "We are working on solving very complex, large-scale tasks to ensure a reliable future for Russia, the future of our people," he said in televised remarks to members of his Security Council on Wednesday.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Martial law means tighter security checks and restrictions on movement in the areas affected.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63323263" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Russia is now implementing martial law in areas of Ukraine that it recently annexed - Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south and Donetsk and Luhansk in the east. The Kremlin claims those regions are now part of Russia - a claim internationally rejected and condemned. Martial law means tighter security checks and restrictions on movement in the areas affected. But the war has already curbed the rights and freedoms of Ukrainians under occupation.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> But they could include restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader powers for law enforcement agencies.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-1.6621422" target="_blank">CBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| He also gave emergency extra powers to the heads of Russian regions and issued a decree restricting movement in and out of eight regions adjoining Ukraine. Putin didn't immediately spell out the powers that martial law would grant. But they could include restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader powers for law enforcement agencies. Putin's order also opens the door for restrictive measures to be extended across Russia.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> But in a related decree, Putin announced heightened security levels extended to Russian regions bordering Ukraine to protect critical civilian and military infrastructure.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/first-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/19/1129853677/an-occupied-region-of-ukraine-is-evacuating-residents-to-russia" target="_blank">Up First</a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| A decree posted to the Kremlin website said a coalition of the government's defense and security agencies as well as a "special coordinating council" headed by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin would now have three days to come up with proposals to instill order. Analysts and Ukrainian officials say the decree may not change much on the ground for populations living in parts of Ukraine already administered by Russia's military or its proxies. But in a related decree, Putin announced heightened security levels extended to Russian regions bordering Ukraine to protect critical civilian and military infrastructure. The provision gives authorities broad new powers including the right to restricted movement around the country, search and seizure, and detention of individuals in prison for up to one month without charges or trial.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> His decree gives law enforcement agencies three days to submit specific proposals and orders the creation of territorial defense forces in the four annexed regions.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/national-international/vladimir-putin-declares-martial-law-in-illegally-annexed-regions-of-ukraine/2887168/" target="_blank">nbcmiami.com</a></div><div></div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| Russian President Vladimir Putin declared martial law Wednesday in the four regions of Ukraine that Moscow annexed and gave additional emergency powers to the heads of all regions of Russia. Putin didnt immediately spell out the steps that would be taken under martial law, but said his order was effective starting Thursday. His decree gives law enforcement agencies three days to submit specific proposals and orders the creation of territorial defense forces in the four annexed regions. "We are working to solve very difficult large-scale tasks to ensure Russias security and safe future, to protect our people," Putin said in televised remarks at the start of a Security Council meeting.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> The Russian Presidents decree imposing martial law in four annexed regions of Ukraine means more restrictions, security measures.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/19/putins-martial-law-all-you-need-to-know-in-under-500-words" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| The Russian Presidents decree imposing martial law in four annexed regions of Ukraine means more restrictions, security measures.

Several of the regions, which have been important staging areas for Russias fight in Ukraine, have come under increasing Ukrainian fire in recent weeks. The order allows for unspecified economic mobilization in the regions, and it seemingly lays the groundwork to organize residents to support the military and security services. Much about the measures is vague, giving the state more legal room to maneuver.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> It placed them in a special regime one step below martial law and allowed for the restriction of people's movements.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-declares-martial-law-four-unilaterally-annexed-regions-ukraine-2022-10-19/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| A Kyiv official said it would change nothing. The published Kremlin decree ordered an "economic mobilisation" in eight regions adjoining Ukraine, including Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014. It placed them in a special regime one step below martial law and allowed for the restriction of people's movements. Putin conferred additional powers on the leaders of all Russia's 80-plus regions to protect critical facilities, maintain public order and increase production in support of the war effort.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> The decree on the regions imposes a series of alert levels in Russian regions.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/europe/putin-russia-martial-law-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Oct 19th, 2022</div></div>| Rumors about the introduction of martial law have circulated since the February 24 invasion of Ukraine. But if the past months are any guide, the measures are part of a slow-motion tightening of control over Russian society that began with the crushing of independent media and continued with the introduction of partial mobilization. The decree on the regions imposes a series of alert levels in Russian regions. In the annexed region of Crimea and Crimea and in Krasnodar Territory, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, Rostov regions, authorities will introduce a "medium alert level" that will restrict movement and transportation and makes provision for the "temporary resettlement of residents to safe areas," without providing further specifics about the populations that might need to move.|
