## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Ukraine has introduced its newest reconnaissance drone, "SHARK," designed to spot for artillery units and resistant to electronic warfare, which could potentially aid in countering kamikaze drone attacks by improving target acquisition for defensive systems <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Additionally, Ukraine has employed radar decoys to deceive anti-radiation seekers on drones and has requested more air defense systems from allies, indicating an enhancement of their defensive capabilities against such threats <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

Ukraine has introduced a new reconnaissance drone called "SHARK" that is resistant to electronic warfare attacks, which could potentially be used to spot and track enemy kamikaze drones <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. To counter the threat of satellite navigation jamming or spoofing on drones such as the Shahed, Ukraine has employed radar decoys that can mislead drones' anti-radiation seekers and has pointed out that these slow-moving drones are susceptible to being shot down by shoulder-fired missiles like the Stinger or anti-aircraft guns such as the Gepard <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Additionally, Ukraine has been actively requesting more air defense systems and ammunition from its allies to strengthen its defense against the increased use of kamikaze drones by Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Moreover, Ukraine is developing its own technology to counteract the strikes from these drones, although specific details on these technologies have not been disclosed <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Ukraine has been actively seeking and deploying various countermeasures to defend against the kamikaze drone attacks that it faces. The Ukrainian military is making use of the German-made IRIS-T air defense system, which has proven to be effective in intercepting these drones <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. In addition to this, they have developed their own reconnaissance drone, the "SHARK," which is designed to assist artillery units and is resistant to electronic warfare attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Ukraine's air defense forces are also reported to be successfully taking down the majority of the Shahed drones, indicating that existing systems are being adapted to counter this new threat <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Ukraine has requested more air defense systems and ammunition from its allies in response to the increased use of kamikaze drones by Russia, and some Western countries have begun to provide more modern equipment to bolster Ukraine's capabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The country has also been using radar decoys to mislead any potential anti-radiation seekers that the drones may have, and due to the drones' slow speed and low altitude, they are vulnerable to being shot down by shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles like the Stinger or anti-aircraft guns such as the Gepard <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. These combined efforts reflect Ukraine's multi-layered approach to countering the kamikaze drone threat.

Eight months into defending against Russia's all-out invasion, Ukraine continues to innovate on the battlefield. Today, Ukraine introduced its newest drone, called "SHARK," designed largely as a reconnaissance spotting device for Ukrainian artillery units. Developed by the Ukrainian company Ukrspetssistem, SHARK is resistant to electronic warfare attacks, according to the official Ukrainian STRATCOM Telegram channel, but no specific details were provided.|

Russia has installed more resilient GNSS satellite navigation modules to offer additional protection against electronic warfare, but this seems only partially effective, according to Ukrainian sources. The use of radar decoys by Ukrainian forces, moreover, could deceive the drones anti-radiation seekers, if they have them installed. And, last but not least, their slow speed and low altitude means they are vulnerable to shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles like the Stinger or anti-aircraft guns such as the German-made Gepard.|

Kyiv says Moscow has used Iranian-supplied kamikaze drones in strikes against Kyiv, Vinnytsia,Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and other cities across Ukraine in recent weeks, and pleaded with Western countries to step up their assistance in the face of the new challenge.|

The Oplot-M, based on the Soviet-designed T-80, has a powerful 1,500-horsepower, six-cylinder diesel engine that gives the tank a top speed of 43 miles per hour. Its Zaslon active protection system, designed to be used alongside explosive-reactive armor, can withstand impacts from incoming missiles traveling at speeds of up to 1,200 meters per second. While Ukraine did not invest substantially in this design, Thailand did, purchasing 49 lightly modified Oplot tanks in 2011.|

Authorities said Moscow has also used them in assaults against Kyiv, Vinnytsia,Odesa and other cities across Ukraine in recent weeks. Ukrainian officials have pleaded with Western countries to step up their assistance in the face of the new challenge, in addition to developing its own technology to counter the strikes. Kamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system.|

The air defenses Ukraine needs to combat kamikaze drones are different from the systems that are used against cruise missiles and similar weapons. The Patriot air defense missile system which stands for "Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target" is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, as well as advanced aircraft and cruise missiles, and could be used against drones. Ukrainian officials said that Ukrainian air defense forces were already taking down the "bulk" of the Shahed drones.|

Iran denies supplying unmanned aerial vehicles to Russia. In his address, Zelenskyy also thanked everyone who helps Ukraine with anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. According to the president, the German "IRIS-T" has shown itself as "a really effective system."|

Its Bayraktar TB2 drones a medium-sized aircraft that can launch missiles have in years past faced off against Russian armor and Russia-aligned fighters in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh. Now in Ukraine they hunt Russian troops, with Kyiv deploying the dozens of TB2s it purchased to such powerful effect that Ukrainians dedicated a song to the drones battlefield prowess. At the same time, Russia is a vital economic trading partner: It provides almost half of Turkeys natural gas and almost three-quarters of its wheat.|

The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv described the drone attacks as "desperate and reprehensible." Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat admitted that the swarms of kamikaze drones posed a particular difficulty for the countrys air defenses, which have only very recently begun to receive more modern Western equipment. Video footage from Kyiv appeared to show at least one shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile being fired, ineffectively, against one of the drones.|

Where do they come from? Ukraine says Russia imported the drones from Iran, where they are known as Shahed-136, which could be translated as "witness of faith" but also as "martyr". Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, accused Tehran of being responsible for the "murders of Ukrainians".|
