The duration of their stay is largely uncertain; however, the IAEA Director General, Rafael Grossi, initially stated that the technical visit was expected to last \"a few days\" (3). Subsequently, Grossi stated that two IAEA experts will remain at the plant indefinitely (4). This suggests that while the initial mission was short-term, there has been a shift towards establishing a continued presence at the site (4,8).\n\nThe duration of the IAEA team's stay could be influenced by several factors. One key factor is the need to establish a \"nuclear safety and security protection zone\" around the power plant (4). The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, highlighted the need for plant operators to carry out their responsibilities and maintain communications, and for the IAEA experts to work without hindrance (5). Another influencing factor is the ongoing conflict and accusations of sabotage from both Russia and Ukraine (7). Furthermore, the IAEA chief is also requesting the military to hand back the occupied crisis center, suggesting that the situation on the ground will likely impact the timeline of the IAEA's mission (10)."

Their trip was mired in risk as shelling had broken out on Thursday, with both Russian and Ukrainian officials confirming that the nearby city of Enerhodar had endured a morning of bombardment. Mortar shelling by Russians forced one of the the plant's two working reactors to shut down on the same day, Ukraine's nuclear operator Energoatom said Thursday, while Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of shelling the IAEA mission's pre-agreed route to the plant.

Grossi -- who left the plant on Thursday -- said that he would bereporting to the agency's Board of Governors \"and then we are establishing a continued presence there...so that they can continue to provide me and all of us with the impartial, neutral, technically sound assessment of whatever it may be happening there.\" Meanwhile, the Ukrainians have demanded that the IAEA press for the demilitarization of the area around the plant, which is currently held by Russian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his Thursday video message that demilitarization was \"the goal of Ukrainian and international efforts. And it is bad that we have not yet heard the appropriate call from the IAEA. Although we talked about it with Mr. Grossi at our meeting in Kyiv. It was the key -- the key -- security point of our agreements: demilitarization and full control by our nuclear workers.\" But such a move would be beyond the IAEA's limited mandate -- and the agency shows no sign of addressing it. Instead, Grossi stressed the technical nature of the visit while in Zaporizhzhia and the examination of what he called \"three or four key areas\" at the plant, including emergency systems and control rooms The so-called \"seven pillars\" of the agency's framework include the physical integrity of facilities, their safety systems, secure off-site power supply, effective radiation monitoring systems and reliable communications with the regulator. Some background: The plant and the area around it, including the adjacent city of Enerhodar, have endured persistent shelling that has raised fears of a nuclear accident through the interruption of the power supply to the facility. Each side accuses the other of acts of nuclear terrorism. Russia has insisted the military presence at the plant is to protect it; Ukraine says that the Russians are using the territory of the plant to fire at Ukrainian-held territory on the other side of the river Dnipro. What now? Each side is working hard to present its version of the situation to the IAEA team. The Ukrainian side is concerned that even at the plant, the Russians will seek to withhold the reality from the inspectors. On Thursday, Zelensky said:\"We have specific information that Russia has done a lot of cynical things in order to deceive the [IAEA] mission.\" It was a theme picked up Friday by Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom, who said on Telegram: \"The Russian occupiers are making every effort to prevent the International Atomic Energy Agency mission from getting to know the facts on the ground at the Zaporizhzhia NPP.\" Alexander Volga, head of the Russian-backed military-civil administration of Enerhodar, said Friday that the IAEA team \"was provided with relevant documents on the nuclear power plant, as well as a map of shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\" The IAEA will tread carefully, sticking to its seven pillars in pursuing a strictly technical path to ensure the plant's systems are in working order and that it has an uninterrupted power supply.",

He said it was \"bad that we have not yet heard the appropriate calls [for demilitarisation] from the IAEA\".\n\nRussian state media have published videos of Russian officials from Rosatom, Russias state nuclear agency, giving the mission a tour of the plant.\n\n00:12:43 The Ukrainians living on a nuclear frontline: This is inhumanity video\n\nGrossi said his agency would complete a full report on the visit by early next week and he would brief the UN security council on the visit next Tuesday.\n\nThe Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, told Ukraines 1+1 television channel that \"it is important for us that the station must be under national control, meaning that the station must be returned to the control of Ukraine\".\n\nWe are not going anywhere: Rafael Grossi (in white hat) and his team inspecting the Zaporizhzhia plant. Photograph: Yuri Kochetkov/EPA\n\nGrossi said the security situation was \"pretty difficult\" during his visit. \"There were moments where fire was obvious, heavy machine gun, artillery, mortars two or three times we were very concerned.\" But he said the mission received \"splendid support from the UN security team\".\n\n\"I think we showed that the international community is there, could be there and we will be continuing this,\" Grossi said.\n\nZaporizhzhia, has faced repeated shelling in recent weeks, with Kyiv and Moscow blaming each other for the attacks, raising concerns of a possible disaster. On Thursday, a dawn shelling attack on the area forced one of the plants six reactors to shut down.\n\nOn Friday afternoon the electricity supply to a reactor was reconnected after it was cut for the second time in 10 days because of shelling, according to Energoatom. The plant needs electricity for its cooling and security systems. In the event all supply lines are cut, the plants workers would have 90 minutes to avoid dangerous overheating.\n\nIn a video address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy reiterated his frequent calls that all troops be removed from the plant. \"The main thing that must happen is the demilitarisation of the stations territory,\" he said. \"Demilitarisation and full control of Ukrainian nuclear workers.\"",

All times EDT.\n\n10:27 p.m.: American B-52 bombers flew low over Stockholm's parliament and palace on Friday as Sweden ramps up exercises with the United States in view of the Scandinavian country's application to join NATO.\n\nWhile the U.S. bombers have taken part in exercises in Sweden before, it was the first time they have flown over the capital, a military spokesperson, Therese Fagerstedt, told Agence France-Presse.\n\nSweden and Finland applied to join the Atlantic alliance in May following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The US and other Western powers have since intensified military exercises and shows of military might across the region.\n\n9:05 p.m.: G-20 energy talks in Bali ended Friday with the world's leading economies pledging to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy, Agrence France-Presse reported, but there was no binding agreement as officials struggle to overcome discord over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe non-binding \"Bali Compact\", which lists principles for achieving net zero emissions, was agreed by all members, Indonesian energy minister Arifin Tasrif said.\n\nDetails were not released but the minister said the plan seeks to strengthen national energy planning and implementation to improve energy security, efficiency and boost investment and financing.\n\n8 p.m.: Russian ex-president Dmitry Medvedev said Russia would turn off gas supply to Europe if Brussels pushes ahead with a price cap on Russian gas.\n\nResponding to comments by European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen about putting a ceiling on the price Europe pays for Russian gas, Medvedev wrote on the Telegram messaging app: \"There will simply be no Russian gas in Europe.\"\n\n7:10 p.m.: Swedish home appliance giant Electrolux and French industrial gas company Air Liquide both announced plans to withdraw from Russia on Friday, the latest foreign firms to leave since Moscow invaded Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nElectrolux suspended its operations in Russia after the invasion. The Swedish group does not have a production site in Russia, but before the war the country accounted for 1.6% of its global turnover.\n\nMeanwhile Air Liquide, which employs nearly 720 people in Russia, said it plans to withdraw from Russia by handing over its activities in the country to local managers.\n\nIt said its turnover in Russia represents less than 1% percent of the group's total, which exceeded $23 billion in 2021.\n\n6:05 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden will request $11.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress to provide lethal aid and budget support to Ukraine, and $22.4 billion for COVID-19 relief ahead of a potential fall case surge, the White House said on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe emergency funding request will also include $2 billion to address the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine on U.S. energy supplies, Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), wrote in blog post.\n\nThe $47.1 billion request comes ahead of the conclusion of the 2022 fiscal year on Sept 30. Congress has not yet passed a 2023 funding bill, and Young said lawmakers would likely need to pass a stopgap funding measure allowing them more time to negotiate a more comprehensive fiscal package.\n\nThe White House's requests for the stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution (CR), will also include $3.9 billion in funding to fight against an outbreak of the monkeypox virus and $6.5 billion for natural disaster relief, Young wrote.\n\n5:12 p.m.: Europes energy crisis loomed larger Friday after Russian energy giant Gazprom said it couldnt resume the supply of natural gas through a key pipeline to Germany for now, citing what it said was a need for urgent maintenance work to repair key components, just hours before it was due to restart deliveries, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Russian state-run energy company had shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Wednesday for what it said would be three days of maintenance.\n\nIt said in a social media post Friday evening that it had identified \"malfunctions\" of a turbine and added that the pipeline would not work unless those were eliminated.\n\nIt was the latest development in a saga in which Gazprom has advanced technical problems as the reason for reducing gas flows through Nord Stream 1 explanations that German officials have rejected as a cover for a political power play following Russias invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEuropean utilities have scrambled to find additional supply during the summer months to get ready for the winters heating demands, buying expensive liquefied gas that comes by ship, while additional supplies have come by pipeline from Norway and Azerbaijan.\n\nFears of a winter shortage have eased somewhat as storage has progressed, but a complete cutoff could present Europe with serious difficulties, analysts say. The European Union needs to step up efforts to reduce gas consumption, said energy policy expert Simone Tagliapietra at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels.\n\n4:18 p.m.: The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday that he and his team saw everything they asked to see at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, were not surprised by anything, and he will issue a report early next week on his findings, VOAs United Nations correspondent Margaret Besheer reported.\n\n\"My concern would be the physical integrity would be the power supply and of course the staff,\" Rafael Mariano Grossi told reporters at the airport in Vienna moments after landing.\n\nHe said it is very important for the IAEA to have a physical presence at the facility.\n\n\"What we are doing there is stabilizing, looking at safety, the security, at the safeguard aspects of the plant, in the conviction that if we get this right, this will have some bearing, [some] influence in what happens overall,\" he said.\n\nA team of 13 experts accompanied Grossi, and he said six have remained at Zaporizhzhia. Of those six, two will remain until hostilities cease, which he said will make a huge difference.\n\n2:45 p.m.: Ukraine's military said it had carried out strikes against Russian positions in the region around the southern town of Enerhodar on Friday, near a nuclear power plant where U.N. experts are working, Reuters reported.\n\nThe revelation by the armed forces' general staff was unusual, since the military rarely gives details of specific targets. A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency is gathering data at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, on the edge of Russian-occupied Enerhodar.\n\n\"It has been confirmed that in the region around the towns of Kherson and Enerhodar, precise strikes by our armed forces destroyed three enemy artillery systems as well as a warehouse with ammunition and up to a company of soldiers,\" the general staff said in a Facebook post.\n\nIt did not give more details about the strikes. Kherson is about 300 km (185 miles) south-west of Enerhodar.\n\nRussia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shelling the nuclear power plant. Kyiv rejects the charge, saying pro-Moscow forces are responsible for attacking the facility.\n\n2 p.m.: U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi holds a news conference on Friday around 2:00 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) upon his return from Ukraine, where he led a mission to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the watchdog said.\n\nThe news conference is being held at Vienna airport after Grossi landed there, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement.\n\n1:25 p.m.: The International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant could still be important despite the difficulties met due to Russian presence at the site, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\n\"We did everything to ensure that (the) IAEA would get access to the Zaporizhzhia plant and I believe that this mission may still have a role to play,\" Zelenskyy said in a video streamed at The European House, Ambrosetti Forum meeting in northern Italy.\n\nUkraine's state nuclear company earlier on Friday said that the IAEA mission had not been allowed to enter the plant's crisis center, where Ukraine says Russian troops are stationed, and would struggle to make an impartial assessment of the situation.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we haven't heard the main thing from the IAEA which is the call for Russia to demilitarize the station,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I hope the mission will comply with what we've agreed and that it will serve the interests of the entire international community.\"\n\n12:50 p.m.: After his son, a Russian soldier, was killed in Ukraine, Rinat Sadykov volunteered to join the Russian forces. Back at his home in Siberia, he discusses the loss of his son and his disappointment with the state of the Russian military in eastern Ukraine. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n12:20 p.m.: Fourteen Ukrainian service personnel have been returned to Ukraine in a new prisoner exchange, Ukraine's POW co-ordination center said on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe center did not specify who was released in return.\n\nOne of the released Ukrainian POWs was an officer, and another a medic, the coordination center said.\n\n11:40 a.m.: Finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial powers on Friday pledged to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil in a bid to limit the Kremlins revenues and ability to fund its war in Ukraine, while also curtailing the wars impact on energy prices and inflation, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe ministers said they would impose the cap by barring insurance or shipping companies from helping Russia sell oil at prices above the set limit.\n\nThe decision follows discussions at the groups summit earlier this year and aims at solving one of the vexing problems with sanctions against Russia: Global oil prices have risen on fears of restricted supply, which has only fattened the Kremlins take.\n\nMeanwhile, skyrocketing energy prices have fed inflation that is squeezing consumers in rich and poor countries alike and threatens to push Europe into recession.\n\n11:05 a.m.: A 31-year-old woman from eastern Ukraine has been detained on accusations of sending the locations of her soldier husband's unit and other army assets to Russian military intelligence, Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) said on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe unnamed woman from Dnipropetrovsk region passed on information about the locations of military buildings and equipment along frontline positions in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, the SBU wrote on Telegram.\n\nThe woman would question her husband about the location of his unit and other Ukrainian formations on the frontline, the agency said.\n\n\"She would pass the information she received through messenger applications to Russian military intelligence, where it was used for artillery and air strikes,\" its statement said. \"She took this step despite the fact that she is married to a serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and that they have a son together,\" the agency said.\n\n10:25 a.m.:\n\n9:15 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to stay away from the funeral on Saturday of Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, sends a deliberate message that underlines his differing view of the world, one of Russia's most prominent journalists has said, according to Reuters.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Pozner, a veteran journalist who interviewed Gorbachev many times and who knows Russia's political elite well, Putin's decision not to attend the funeral was a calculated one.\n\n\"I think its a kind of a statement,\" Pozner, 88, told Reuters in an interview. \"And I dont think that Mr. Putin is a particular fan of Mr. Gorbachev. Thats his right, he doesnt have to be. I think they saw the world very differently.\"\n\nPutin called the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, over which Gorbachev unwittingly presided, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century which he would reverse if given a chance. Gorbachev was devastated too by the collapse of the USSR which he had hoped to reform and preserve.\n\nPutin's decision to launch what he called \"a special military operation\" in Ukraine appears aimed at reversing, at least in part, the collapse which Gorbachev failed to prevent.\n\n8:30 a.m.: President Joe Biden will meet with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa this month, as the administration looks to draw African nations closer to the U.S. at a time when South Africa and many of its neighbors have staked out neutral ground on Russias invasion of Ukraine, The Associated Press reported Friday.\n\nAnnouncement of the September 16 visit comes on the heels of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkens visit to South Africa last month, in which he said the Biden administration sees Africas 54 nations as \"equal partners\" in tackling global problems.\n\nBut the administration has been disappointed that South Africa and much of the continent have declined to follow the U.S. in condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSouth Africa abstained in a United Nations vote to condemn Russias action, and Ramaphosa has avoided any criticism of Russia and instead has called for a mediated peace.\n\n8:10 a.m.:\n\n7:55 a.m.: The United Nations food agency's world price index fell for a fifth month in a row in August, further from all-time highs hit earlier this year, as a resumption of grain exports from Ukrainian ports contributed to improved supply prospects, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Friday that its price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 138.0 points last month versus a revised 140.7 for July.\n\nThe July figure was previously put at 140.9.\n\nThe index has fallen from a record of 159.7 in March, hit after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The August reading was, however, 7.9% higher than a year earlier.\n\nFAO's cereal price index fell 1.4% month-on-month in August, with the re-opening of Ukrainian Black Sea ports under a diplomatic deal as well as favorable wheat harvest prospects in North America and Russia weighing on prices, the agency said.\n\nIn separate cereal supply and demand estimates, FAO lowered its forecast for global cereal production in 2022 to 2.774 billion metric tons from a previous projection of 2.792 billion in early July.\n\n7:15 a.m.: A cargo ship carrying tons of grain from Ukraine was stranded in Istanbuls Bosporus and had to be rescued early Friday, The Associated Press reported.\n\nTurkeys Directorate General of Coastal Safety tweeted that the 173-meter cargo ship was stuck off the coast of the scenic Bebek neighborhood late Thursday because of a rudder malfunction. The busy strait was closed to traffic for the rescue by coastal safety boats. The Panama-flagged Lady Zehma was towed and the strait re-opened.\n\nThe cargo ship had departed the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk under the deal brokered by the United Nations that allows the safe shipment of Ukrainian grain. Its the first reported incident of malfunction since grain shipments restarted last month.\n\nOn August 29, the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul which monitors the ships under the grain deal and is composed of Turkish, Russian, Ukrainian and U.N. officials authorized the movement of Lady Zehma with 3,000 metric tons of corn to Ravenna, Italy. The ship is currently anchored in the Marmara Sea off the coast of Istanbul.\n\n6:50 a.m.: Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over each others' actions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Friday as a team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog tried to check the safety of the facility and avert a potential disaster, Reuters reported.\n\nUkraine's state nuclear company said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission had not been allowed to enter the plant's crisis center, where Ukraine says Russian troops are stationed, and would struggle to make an impartial assessment. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Ukraine was continuing to shell the plant, raising the risk of a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nThe site, 10 km (6 miles) from Ukrainian positions across the Dnipro river, was captured by Russian forces soon after they invaded Ukraine in late February and has become the focus of concern.\n\nIt has come under repeated shelling over the past month, with Kyiv and Moscow trading blame for the firing. The plant is still run by Ukrainian staff and Russia has rejected calls for it to withdraw its troops.\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Grossi and his team spent several hours at Europe's largest nuclear power plant on Thursday and intended to return on Friday across the frontlines to assess damage. Speaking after the initial visit, Grossi said the physical integrity of the plant had been violated several times and he was worried by the situation there. Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said it would be would be difficult for the IAEA team to make an impartial assessment due to Russian interference.\n\n6:25 a.m.: Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has reportedly recruited almost 1,000 inmates from two penal colonies in the southwestern Rostov region, promising them early release if they fight in Moscow's war against Ukraine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nPrigozhin is a businessman who is believed to be the leader of Russia's Wagner private paramilitary group.\n\nThe Vot Tak online television channel quoted inmates at a penal colony in the city of Bataisk on September 1 as saying that Prigozhin arrived at the penitentiary in recent days by personal helicopter along with his associate Dmitry Utkin. He then met with all of the inmates at the colony's central square.\n\nAccording to the inmates, the administration of the IK-15 penal colony ordered all guards to switch off their personal video cameras while Prigozhin and Utkin talked to the inmates.\n\nThey said Prigozhin promised those who joined Russian armed forces in Ukraine will get early release in six months, adding that during the military operations in Ukraine, the inmates \"can do anything they want with the Ukrainians.\"\n\n5:45 a.m.: Two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will stay at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on a permanent basis, Russia's ambassador to international institutions in Vienna told the RIA Novosti news agency on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nAn IAEA mission is currently at the plant, Europe's largest nuclear facility which has been under the control of Russian forces since March.\n\n5:40 a.m.:\n\n5:34 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said Heavy fighting continues in southern Ukraine, including shelling in Enerhodar district, near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.\n\n4:28 a.m.: The latest Ukraine assessment from the Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said Russian forces conducted ground attacks northwest of Slovyansk, south and northeast of Bakhmut, and northwest and southwest of Donetsk City.\n\nThe Russian 3rd Army Corps is continuing to form for deployment to Donbas, the update said, and Russian milbloggers reiterated claims that Ukrainian forces are fighting along four axes of advance in Western Kherson Oblast.\n\n3:32 a.m.: The Joint Operational Coordination Centre has approved eight vessels carrying a total of 158,075 metric tons of grain and other food products to leave Ukraine on Friday.\n\nThey are: the Nord Virgo, from Yuhzny/Pivdennyi to Huangpu, China, carrying 62,340 metric tons of corn; the Stella GS, from Odesa to Haifa, Israel, carrying 30,300 metric tons of corn; the Katsuyama, from Chornomorsk to Haldia, India, carrying 21,000 metric tons of sunflower oil; the Mavka, from Chornomorsk to Constanta, Romania, carrying 12,500 metric tons of sunflower oil; the Fulmar S, from Yuhzny/Pivdennyi to Varna, Bulgaria, carrying 9,835 metric tons of sunflower meal; the Spring, from Chornomorsk to Iskandarun, Turkey, carrying 8,500 metric tons of wheat; the Canga Star, from Chornomorsk to Brest, France, carrying 7,000 metric tons of rapeseed, and the Mubariz Ibrahimov, from Odesa to Tekirdag, Turkey, carrying 6,600 metric tons of sunflower oil.\n\n2:40 a.m.: Finland on Thursday slashed the number of visas issued to Russian citizens to a tenth of the regular amount in a move seen as a show of solidarity with Ukraine.\n\nFinland, which shares the longest border with Russia of all European Union member countries, announced the decision in August amid growing pressure from politicians and ordinary citizens to restrict the movement of Russian tourists through the Nordic country as Moscow continues its war in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nStarting Thursday, Finland will only permit Russians to apply for tourist visas once a week and in just four Russian cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Murmansk and Petrozavodsk close to the Finnish border.\n\nFinnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he was particularly worried about a kind of Russian \"tourist route\" through Helsinki airport, which has been used by thousands of Russians before Moscows Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine.\n\nOn top of its visa decision, the Finnish Foreign Ministry said the government is currently exploring the possibility of helping Russian human rights defenders, civil society members and journalists critical to the Kremlin by establishing a new kind of humanitarian visa enabling them to access the Nordic country.\n\n1:30 a.m.: U.S. law enforcement agents on Thursday searched New York properties linked to Viktor Vekselberg, a sanctioned billionaire Russian oligarch, NBC New York reported, as Washington seeks to use sanctions and property seizures to pressure Moscow to stop its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA Reuters witness observed FBI and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents haul boxes and safes out of an apartment building on Park Avenue in Manhattan, where NBC said a property linked to Vekselberg was located.\n\nAgents also searched a Vekselberg-linked property in Southampton, New York, NBC said.\n\nVekselberg could not be reached for comment. An FBI spokeswoman confirmed that agents were present at the Manhattan and Southampton addresses but declined to comment further. An HSI spokesperson declined to comment.\n\n12:02 a.m.: Geopolitical tensions simmered at the U.S. Open on Thursday as Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk refused the customary handshake at the net when Belarusian Victoria Azarenka defeated her 6-2 6-3 in the second round.\n\nThe pair exchanged a quick tap of the racket on Court 17.\n\nIt marked the latest uneasy moment at the year's final major tennis tournament, where Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians compete alongside one another against the backdrop of military conflict.\n\nBelarus is being used as a key staging ground for Russia's war in Ukraine, which Moscow terms a \"special operation.\"\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.",

The three others were lost earlier during the conflict.\n\nHowever, the IAEA experts now present at Europes largest nuclear power plant located in the middle of a war zone also learnt that the 330/750 kV reserve line linking the facility to a nearby thermal power plant was delivering the electricity the ZNPP generates to the external grid. The same reserve line can also provide back-up power to the ZNPP if needed.\n\nIn addition, plant management informed the IAEA team that one of the ZNPPs two operating units was disconnected in the afternoon today due to grid restrictions. The same unit 5 was disconnected also on 1 September the day of Director General Grossis arrival at the site due to an internal electrical failure but it was reconnected the following day.\n\nOne reactor is still operating and producing electricity both for cooling and other essential safety functions at the site and for households, factories and others through the grid. The ZNPP is held by Russian forces since early March, but its Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate the plant.\n\n\"Our team on the ground received direct, fast and reliable information about the latest significant development affecting the plants external power situation, as well as the operational status of the reactors. We already have a better understanding of the functionality of the reserve power line in connecting the facility to the grid. This is crucial information in assessing the overall situation there,\" Director General Grossi said.\n\n\"The great value of finally having the IAEA permanently present at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant is already abundantly clear. It is a game changer,\" he said, adding that the IAEA remained in close contact with its Ukrainian counterparts and continued to receive valuable updates about the situation from them.\n\nFriday evenings disconnection of the 750 kV power line which happened temporarily also on 25 August followed renewed shelling in the area, Ukraine separately informed the IAEA.\n\nA secure off-site power supply from the grid and back-up power supply systems are essential for ensuring nuclear safety. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict. At a press conference on Friday evening after returning to Vienna, he expressed his concern about the off-site power supply situation at the ZNPP by marking this pillar half red, half yellow in a traffic light-style infographic about the plants safety status.\n\nFurther underlining the fragile nuclear safety and security situation, there had been continued shelling of the site from 29 August up to the day before the Director General and his team arrived at the ZNPP. There was damage to the facilitys solid radioactive waste storage, the ventilation pipe of special building 1, and the ZNPP training building.\n\nAt the ZNPP, the ISAMZ experts will carry out detailed and continuous work to assess the physical damage to the plants facilities, determine the functionality of the main and back-up safety and security systems and evaluate the staffs working conditions, in addition to performing urgent safeguards activities on the site.\n\n\"The difference between having the IAEA at the site and not having us there is like day and night. I remain gravely concerned about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant this hasnt changed but the continued presence of the IAEA will be of paramount importance in helping to stabilise the situation. Im immensely proud of the critically important and courageous work the IAEA team is now able to perform at the ZNPP,\" Director General Grossi said.\n\nThe Director General will early next week issue a report about the safety, security and safeguards situation in Ukraine including the findings from his mission to the ZNPP.",

Kherson region. Ukraine. Today,\" Tymoshenko wrote in a Facebook post over a photo of three soldiers on rooftops, one of them fixing a Ukrainian flag to a post.\n\nUkraine began a counter-offensive last week targeting the south, particularly the Kherson region, which Russia seized early in the conflict.\n\nZelenskyys remarks came a day after he warned Europeans that Russia was preparing \"a decisive energy blow\" during the cold months ahead.\n\nMoscow has cited Western sanctions and technical issues for the energy disruptions. European countries who have backed Kyiv with diplomatic and military support have accused Russia of weaponizing energy supplies.\n\nSome analysts say the shortages and a surge in living costs as winter approaches risk sapping Western support for Kyiv as governments try to deal with disgruntled populations.\n\nSeparately, the US embassy in Moscow said John Sullivan, the ambassador since his appointment by former President Donald Trump in 2019, had left his post and was retiring from the diplomatic service. A State Department official said Sullivan had served a typical tour length.\n\nLast week Moscow said it would keep the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, its main gas channel to Germany, closed and G7 countries announced a planned price cap on Russian oil exports.\n\nRussia scraps Nord Stream 1 reopening, stoking European fuel fears Russia has scrapped a Saturday 3 September deadline to resume flows via a major gas supply route to Germany, deepening Europes difficulties in securing winter fuel, after saying it had found faults in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline during maintenance.\n\nThe Kremlin said it would stop selling oil to any countries that implemented the cap.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday his government had been planning for a total halt in gas deliveries in December, promising measures to lower prices and tie social benefits to inflation.\n\n\"Russia is no longer a reliable energy partner,\" Scholz told a news conference in Berlin.\n\nIn response, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev accused Germany of being an enemy of Russia. \"In other words, it has declared a hybrid war on Russia,\" he said.\n\nOn Sunday, Finland and Sweden announced plans to offer billions of dollars to power companies to avert the threat of insolvency amid the crisis.\n\nEyes on Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant\n\nRussian authorities said the situation around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine was calm on Sunday, after UN inspectors said on Saturday it had again lost external power.\n\nNuclear plant loses power line as Moscow, West energy row escalates A critical nuclear power plant in Ukraine again lost external power, international energy officials said on Saturday (3 September), heightening concerns as the energy battle between Moscow and the West ramped up in recent days amid the ongoing war.\n\nThe last remaining main external power line was cut off although a reserve line continued supplying electricity to the grid, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement.\n\nOnly one of its six reactors remained in operation, it said.\n\nRussian troops seized the plant shortly after President Vladimir Putin sent his army over the border on 24 February. It has become a focal point of the conflict. Each side has blamed the other for shelling that has raised fears of a nuclear disaster.\n\nSpeaking to Komsomolskaya Pravda radio, Russian official Vladimir Rogov said there had been no shelling or incursions. IAEA experts are expected to continue working at the plant until at least Monday, Rogov was quoted as saying.\n\nAn IAEA mission toured the plant, which is still operated by Ukrainian staff, last week and some experts have remained there pending the release of an IAEA report.\n\nRussia has resisted international calls to demilitarize the area.\n\nOn other battlefronts, Ukrainian Telegram channels reported explosions at the Antonivsky bridge near the southern city of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces.\n\nThe bridge has been severely damaged by Ukrainian missiles over the past weeks, but Russian troops were trying to repair it or to set up a pontoon crossing or barges to maintain supplies to Russian units on the right bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

That would set into motion a chain of events that could intensify the current nuclear crisis. Here's how.\n\nNuclear plants need electricity\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is the largest in Europe, capable of producing thousands of megawatts of electricity. But the plant also needs power from the same electricity grid it feeds.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe power is used to run the various parts of the plant, including its safety and cooling systems. Specifically, nuclear power plants require water to be pumped constantly through their cores in order to function safely, and the pumps need electricity.\n\nAt Zaporizhzhia, the power is normally supplied by four high-voltage lines, which connect the nuclear complex to Ukraine's electricity grid, but the conflict has seen those lines systematically cut. The last 750kV line was severed on September 3, according to the IAEA.\n\nA backup line was disconnected two days later due to a fire on the site. In a press conference shortly after returning from Zaporizhzhia, Grossi told reporters that he believed the power lines were being deliberately targeted:\n\n\"It is clear that those who have these military aims know very well... to hit where it hurts so that the plant becomes very, very problematic,\" he said.\n\nZaporizhzhia has been making its own power, but that's a limited solution\n\nSince losing its last connection to the grid on Sept. 5, the nuclear plant has been powering itself in so-called \"islanding operation mode.\" Under this setup, the Unit 6 reactor has been producing low levels of electricity that are running the rest of the facility.\n\nThe reactors at Zaporizhzhia are designed to operate in this mode during startup, according to a nuclear engineer who worked directly with the reactors when the plant began operations in the 1980s, but who was not authorized to speak publicly by his current employer.\n\n\"It's not good, it cannot be done for a long time,\" he says. The problem is less to do with the reactor itself than the turbine, generators and other systemsall of which are designed to run at significantly higher power levels than islanding operation mode provides.\n\nAdding to the problem, Grossi said in his statement, is the increasing strain on the plant's Ukrainian operators. Many of the plant's current staff of just under 1,000 live in the nearby town of Enerhodar. Its water, sewage and electrical supplies have all been disrupted in recent days by the same fighting that's damaged the lines around the plant.\n\n\"The shelling is putting in danger operators and their families, making it difficult to adequately staff the plant,\" Grossi says.\n\nShutting down the last reactor will trigger emergency generators\n\nWith conditions deteriorating, it seems more likely that Ukrainian authorities will decide to power down the last reactor. But in the short term, that could exacerbate the crisis.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nThat's because nuclear reactors are more like charcoal grills than gas stoves. Even after they're shut off, they remain hot for a long period of time. Water must still circulate in the cores to prevent a meltdown.\n\nWith its reactors shut down, Zaporizhzhia will switch to backup emergency diesel generators to keep the reactors cool. The emergency generators themselves are a tried-and-true method for cooling a nuclear reactor. In fact, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires U.S. plants to switch to emergency diesel generators immediately, bypassing the \"islanding operation mode\" used in Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"We don't want to go on the diesel generators, but it's a situation you can abide by for awhile,\" says Steven Nesbit, a nuclear engineer and member of the American Nuclear Society's rapid response taskforce, which is tracking the current crisis. For example, after losing power during Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant in Florida operated for days on emergency diesel power.\n\nIf the generators run out of fuel, a meltdown could occur\n\nAccording to the IAEA, the Zaporizhzhia plant has more than a dozen emergency generators standing by. Normally, the plant holds a 10-day reserve of diesel fuel, the agency says, and currently has approximately 2,250 tonnes of fuel available.\n\nIf that fuel is depleted, or the generators are damaged in further fighting, it could trigger a meltdown.\n\nBut Nesbit says that doesn't necessarily mean there would be a Chernobyl-like catastrophe. The meltdown at Chernobyl was due to a unique mix of design flaws and operator error that would be essentially impossible to replicate at Zaporizhzhia.\n\nAnd unlike the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, some of the reactors at Zaporizhzhia have already been shut down for a while, allowing the nuclear fuel to cool somewhat, Nesbit says.\n\nEven in the worst case scenario, the reactors at Zaporizhzhia are a modern design surrounded by a heavy \"containment\" building, Nesbit says. \"It's reinforced concrete, typically about three to four feet of that; it's designed to withstand very high internal pressures.\"\n\nThat could allow it to hold in any radioactive material.\n\nBut the world's nuclear agency doesn't want to test any of this. And for that reason, Grossi is calling on all sides to implement a safety zone immediately.\n\n\"There is no time to waste,\" he says.",

Some radiation monitoring and emergency response systems are working well, after interruptions. Grossi voiced concern about Ukrainian workers who continue work in an atmosphere of \"latent tension\" under Russian supervisors, and praised their professionalism.\n\nThe risk of a nuclear accident will remain as long as fighting around the site continues, Grossi said. \"I was worried, I am worried, I will be worried, for as long as we dont have a stabilized situation in a permanent manner,\" he said. But the IAEA director rebuffed Ukrainian calls for the agency to throw its support behind the creation of a demilitarized zone around the plant, arguing that it was not the agencys job to wade into politics. \"Frankly speaking, there are enough political players in this game,\" he said.",

                "cc_text": "Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant Friday to observe damage to the Russian-controlled facility, as fighting continues around the plant. The IAEA intends to keep two experts at the facility on an extended basis, but the agencys power to change the conditions at the plant including reported anxiety and exhaustion on the part of the Ukrainian workers, heavy fighting around the plant, and Russian attempts to connect the plant to its own power grid is limited.\n\nAfter his five-hour visit Friday, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi briefed reporters back in Vienna at the agencys headquarters, saying his greatest concern was damage to the building during heavy shelling in August. Its still unclear whos responsible for that shelling, as Ukraine and Russia have traded accusations back and forth. However, with the independent IAEA inspectors present, \"when there is an allegation that something has happened at the plant, you can turn to us,\" Grossi said.\n\nEfforts to get a monitoring team from the IAEA, a UN agency, have been ongoing but were heaviest in August due to the intensifying fighting around the plant. Ukraine has mounted an offensive in recent weeks to reclaim Russian-held territory in the south and southeast. While much of the push is presently focused on the city of Kherson, the Zaporizhzhia plant is still quite close to the front approximately 60 miles from Kherson itself and on the northern border of Russian-held territory.\n\nGiven the potential for catastrophe and lack of independent insight into the situation at the plant, Grossi addressed the UN Security Council on August 11, calling again for a mission to Zaporizhzhia; the agency has for months been asking to go to the facility to provide oversight and technical assistance. Since Russia and Ukraine, as parties to the conflict, have given the agency inconsistent information about the safety and operation of the plant, Grossi stressed the need for an independent fact-finding mission. \"It is those facts, gathered during a site visit, that are needed for the IAEA to be able to develop and provide an independent risk assessment of the nuclear safety and security risks,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Europes largest, supplying approximately 20 percent of Ukraines electricity before the war and half of its nuclear power, according to the Washington Post. Its still producing energy, including energy for export to Europe one of Ukraines limited methods of producing revenue in wartime, particularly as the conflict is choking the countrys agriculture exports. However, that makes the reactors vulnerable not only to occupation and attack but also to limited supply lines for spare parts and the potential for Russia to divert power from the plant to its own grid a delicate process, which risks cutting off the supply of power to cool the reactors.\n\n\"Nuclear is a fear factor, and its also a power factor,\" Cindy Vestergaard, a senior fellow and director with the nuclear safeguards program at the Henry L. Stimson Center, told Vox on Saturday. \"With Zaporizhzhia, were getting to something Russia holds very dear, and that is its power over energy sources. And so nuclear is at the heart of geopolitics, its at the heart of energy policies, and, of course, for the world to keep the lights on.\"\n\nWhat did it take to get the IAEA team to Zaporizhzhia?\n\nAs of now, few details about the monitoring mission and the negotiations enabling it to go forward are known. The New York Times reported Wednesday that 14 experts left Kyiv to travel to the Zaporizhzhia plant, traveling through military checkpoints and active fighting to reach the facility.\n\n\"This is totally unprecedented weve never had an active conflict in a country which also has such a robust nuclear power program. Its the seventh-largest nuclear power program in the world,\" Vestergaard said. \"The dance, or the navigation that the agency would have to do is, obviously, between Ukraine and Russia,\" she said, and would involve \"a lot of details, even down to commas, about how things would be outlined in order for the agency to go.\"\n\nOne point of negotiations was whether the team would enter and leave the area through Ukrainian- or Russian-held territory. The mission opted to travel to the facility from Kyiv via Ukrainian-held territory, possibly to avoid legitimizing Russias occupation of the Zaporizhzhia plant. But even something as mundane as the route used to get to the area had consequences for their trip. \"[The IAEA mission] will not be provided with a special pass,\" Vladimir Rogov, an official with the Russian occupation forces told the Times. \"They had a chance to come from Russia through the liberated territory safely, quickly and without obstacles.\" Russia has also refused calls to demilitarize the area, putting the plant at continued risk of damage from shelling.\n\nRussia does have a vested interest in allowing the monitoring team to visit, Scott Roecker, vice president of the Nuclear Threat Initiatives nuclear materials security program, told Vox on Saturday. \"I think it was in the Russians interest to have IAEA come there for a couple of reasons,\" he said. \"One, so that it could demonstrate that the reactor was still operating, and the plant was operating. Also, to a certain degree, having an international organization at the site, having inspectors there it legitimizes, to a certain degree, Russias presence there.\"\n\nDespite the logistical challenges of the mission and the restrictions Russian officials imposed, Grossi said in a press conference Friday that he had open access to everything he asked to see a positive introductory step that will hopefully yield critical, independent information about the state of the plant for the agencys report to its board of governors when that body convenes next week. From there, Roecker said, information and recommendations can reach the diplomatic level and provide valuable insight and context for further negotiation. But, as Vestergaard stressed, this mission is just a start.\n\n\"Im hoping that one report will not be enough,\" she said. \"Its going to be a series of on-the-ground, on-site, continuous surveillance and physical presence at the facility going forward.\"\n\nHow much can the inspectors change at the plant?\n\nThe missions mandate is concerned with three elements within the Zaporizhzhia facility: the safety of its operations, the security of the facility overall, and the safeguarding of nuclear material produced there. The mission can collect information about these elements and disseminate it, but \"these are inspectors, they cant decide to start operating the plant in a certain way if they feel like its not being operated in a safe manner,\" Roecker said. \"They really arent going to get between the people who are managing the site from a Russian perspective and the Ukrainian operators.\"\n\nThe agency also has no oversight or negotiating power regarding the military activity surrounding the facility. However, it can and has recommended that the fighting stop immediately.\n\nThough its powerless in a legal and logistical sense, the information that the mission could share is powerful, Roecker said. \"Were getting an unbiased source inside that facility, sharing information, and there will be a lot of pressure [...] to make sure that any concerns that they raise are somehow rectified. Theres nothing that they can do themselves, but the mere fact that theyre there the information that they will provide and the recommendations that they give will get a ton of attention and there will be a lot of pressure to make those changes.\"\n\nAs of Saturday, the concerned parties have agreed to allow two inspectors to remain in the area, though for how long is thus far unclear. \"My biggest flag will be, if they leave, can they ever get back in,\" Vestergaard said.\n\nBut some Ukrainian officials want a stronger response from the agency. \"I hope that the IAEA will ultimately be able to fulfill its functions,\" Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration, told Ukrinform. \"Theres hope that the international organization will draw conclusions, taking into account all the threats, and together we will protect the world from the absolutely real threat posed by Russia. Either we solve the existing issues together or someone else will address them for us.\"\n\nIn the longer term, as more nations consider nuclear power to mitigate climate change, the agency and the world will have to consider how to deal with the possibility that civilian nuclear power plants could be weaponized. This would require better treaties and agreements around nuclear power generally, and civilian facilities specifically as well as diversifying the nuclear supply chain. With many countries depending on Russian fuel, technology, and spent fuel reprocessing to maintain their nuclear energy production, some European stakeholders are presently looking for ways to move away from dependence on Russias nuclear power dominance.\n\nWhat the IAEA does in Zaporizhzhia will have ripple effects in the future, Vestergaard told Vox. \"This is going to set a precedent for how the agency will interact with facilities under its purview in active conflict zones,\" she said. \"Hopefully, we wont be in a situation like this again, but as more states acquire nuclear power for civilian purposes, this is something we have to consider going forward. This is a game changer.\"",

(Photo Konstantin Mihalchevskiy / Sputnik via AP)\n\nIn a recent Bulletin piece, nuclear power experts assessed that a loss of power supply, a human error, or a military mistake could lead to a disaster at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Whereas much has been said about the plants repeatedly disconnected from the power grid and the daunting working conditions of the staff still at the plant, little is known about Russias military capability in and around the plant and their implications.\n\nAs the IAEA conducts its risky mission at the embattled nuclear plant this week, the Bulletin talked with Valeriia Hesse, a Ukrainian non-proliferation and international security expert based in Vienna, Austria. We discussed the possible impact on the Zaporizhzhia plant of a deliberate or accidental heavy artillery shelling or missile strike.\n\nFranois Diaz-Maurin: Do we know the type of weapons Russia is using in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant? And do we know where they are hidden on the plants premises?\n\nValeriia Hesse: According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Russian troops have used barrel and jet artillery in the Zaporizhzhia region. An engineer at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant [ZNPP] commented that Russian forces placed artillery and missile launchers in and around the plant near the Kakhov reservoir. In this case, not only the types of weapons deployed at ZNPP matter, but more so the types of weapons deployed around that could reach the plants premises.\n\nThe defense intelligence of the Ministry of Defense reported that the Russian military has brought 2C7 \"Pion\" artillery units to the Energodar region [the city where the ZNPP is located] and is shelling the plant from the village of Vodyane [located 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) south of the plant]. Batteries of reactive artillery (BM-21 \"Grad\") are also located there and have a reaching capacity of up to 20 kilometers (12 miles). British intelligence has shown that Russia maintains an increased military presence at the nuclear power plant with armored personnel carriers deployed only some 60 meters from reactor number 5. [Editors note: Since Russia seized the plant in March, only two of the six reactors (units no. 5 and 6) have been operating at the ZNPP. On August 25, Ukraines nuclear power company Energoatom reported both units were temporarily disconnected from the external power line which led to the subsequent tripping of the emergency protection. On September 1, because of a mortar shelling, emergency protection triggered again the shutdown of unit 5, and a backup power line was damaged.] Plant employees, on the condition of anonymity, have reported that there are four armored personnel carriers and five to six transportation vehicles under overpasses at the plant and some other equipment in the turbine compartments of power units no. 1 and 2. On top of that, the workers confirmed that Russia shot from the plants site at Ukrainian drones and at the industrial site and the city of Energodar, all the while accusing Ukraines Armed Forces of conducting these attacks.\n\nDiaz-Maurin: What are the exact capabilities of these weapons? For instance, do they have the capacity to penetrate the containment structures which are approximately a one-meter-thick reinforced concrete wall, and subsequently cause an exposure of the reactors core?\n\nHesse: \"Grad\" is a Soviet and Russian reactive volley fire system (multiple launch rocket system or MLRS) of 122 millimeter (mm) (9K51) caliber. The most common projectile for \"Grad\" M-21OF (index 9M22U) weighs 66 kilograms (kg) and is equipped with 6.4 kg of explosive in the warhead. The maximum speed of the projectile is 690 meters per second (about twice the speed of sound). The energy of the projectile explosion is approximately 10 kg of TNT equivalent, or 12 kg of TNT equivalent if we consider the increased energy output of modern artillery shells. For its part, the \"Pion,\" which is also deployed in the region, is a Soviet-made self-propelled artillery installation equipped with a 203 mm caliber gun (2A44). The Pions ammunition load includes OF-43 high-explosive fragmentation shells and an active-rocket projectile. OF-43 shells weigh 110 kg and contain 17.8 kg of explosives and travel at a velocity of 960 meters per second. The explosive energy for this projectile is about 30 kg of TNT equivalent, or 35 kg of TNT equivalent for a more modern explosive.\n\nA reactor containment is designed and built in such a way as to withstand enormous internal and external forces. The walls strength also has a safety margin, which means it can withstand greater energy than that of the maximum possible design accident. Typically, a reactor containment is designed to withstand the crash of a commercial airplane of over 300 tons at a velocity of 700 km per hour. This means that the reinforced structure could survive an external force of over 70 x 108 Joules, which is equivalent to almost 1.7 tons of TNT.\n\nAt the ZNPP, the containment is also supposed to survive a shock wave with a compression pressure in the front of 30 kilopascals (about 4.3 pounds per square inch or 0.3 atmosphere). For comparison, the incident pressure of a Grad and Pion projectile blast at 20 centimeters (less than one foot) would be almost 36,000 and 50,000 kilopascals, respectively. The 30-kilopascal pressure threshold would be reached with an M-21OF blast or OF-43 blast happening only 11.5 meters (37 feet) or 16 meters (52 feet) away from the reactor containment building, respectively.\n\nSurface analysis suggests that heavy artillery, like the one deployed in the region, has a possibility of damaging the reactor containment of the nuclear power plant if there is a deliberate effort to pierce it and successive strikes hit the same area. Physicist Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies told me that the exact pressure per unit area will be different depending on the size and shape of the plane and projectiles front surface. \"You can compare it to poking fabric with a finger to doing it with a needle,\" he said. However, if less powerful artillery is used, it is unlikely to cause an exposure of the reactors core in a single hit.\n\nLet me add that the containment building is not designed to withstand a missile hit, like those from a Kalibr or Tochka-U. Would one of those missiles hit even 47 meters (154 feet) away from the reactor, it would create a shock wave pressure above the containment design limit.\n\nThe problem is that many of these weapons, including Grad, Pion, and Tochka-U, are in service in both Russia and Ukraine, making it possible for both sides to accuse each other. But the plants workers and Ukrainian officials have since the beginning denounced Russian forces as being responsible for the shelling at the ZNPP.\n\nDiaz-Maurin: Given the confusion around the plant and in the fog of war, whats the likelihood of a nuclear disaster happening now at the ZNPP? What are, in your view, the most likely scenarios potentially leading to such a disaster? A failed or deliberate launch of a missile, a drone strike, or else?\n\nHesse: Let me say this first. Everyone should remember that Zaporizhzhia is an operating nuclear facility. So any military intervention is already critical. The ZNPP is the largest in Europe, and a radiation accident there would be a global catastrophe.\n\nBased on the analysis above, a deliberate heavy artillery shelling or missile strike has indeed a significant probability of damaging a reactor containment. Now, if we speak about particular systems, attack drone payloads like those deployed by Russia in Ukraine (Kub, Lancet, Orion, and Forpost), which have the same explosive energy as small-caliber artillery, have little chance to penetrate the containment and expose the core.\n\nDespite the risk of a nuclear accident, it is implausible that a thermochemical explosion like that at Chornobyl would happen at ZNPP. Two factors (flaws in reactor design combined with human error) led to the accident at Chornobyl. But the ZNPP has a different type of reactor. However, there is a high risk that an accident like that of the Fukushima disaster in Japan could occur.\n\nAt Chornobyl, a nuclear criticality accident triggered an intensive steam explosion in the core and release of radioactivity directly into the atmosphere. (The RBMK-type reactor did not have a containment structure.) Whereas at Fukushima, a natural disaster led to the shutdown of the reactor cooling system, and there were no in-core explosions. Instead, heating, oxidation, and the meltdown of the cores happened gradually over time, while the radioactive release was partially confined within the containment. (The partial release was necessary to maintain an internal pressure inside the containment below its design limit.)\n\nIn my view, the two most likely scenarios threatening the safety of ZNPP are projectiles hitting a spent fuel storage or the plants cooling systems being damaged. Another scenario is to blow up the machine room at the working power units, which is outside the containment building. However, the plants staff has claimed to be prepared for such a scenario.\n\nOn August 6, the Russian forces hit the plant, with an ordnance landing directly next to the spent nuclear fuel storage area and damaging three radiation monitoring sensors around the site. This already created a threat to the plants safety because it impairs timely detection and response in case of increased radiation levels. If Russian forces eventually succeeded in hitting the storage area directly, the spent fuel itself would not cause an explosion, but the blast would disperse radioactive materials into the atmosphere. The degree of the subsequent radiological contamination in Ukraine and neighboring countries would then depend on the weather conditions.\n\nFor its part, if the reactor cooling systems come out of order, the fuel will overheat, creating the conditions for a Fukushima-type accident. Even when a reactor is not operational, the fuel components keep decaying, emitting excessive amounts of heat for years after being taken out of the reactor core into a spent fuel storage pool which also requires cooling. In case of the absence of cooling, the overheating damages fuel rods and can cause a meltdown and the release of radioactive isotopes, from short-lived to the ones with very long half-lives, causing immediate as well as long-term damage to peoples health and the environment.\n\nDiaz-Maurin: What about Russia reportedly planning to disconnect the plant from the electrical grid? Would that pose an additional risk?\n\nHesse: Energoatoms Petro Kotin warned about Russias desire to cut ZNPP off the Ukrainian power grid to connect it to the occupied Crimea and the Russian energy system. The frequencies of the power grids are different, though. Ukraines grid uses a frequency that is synchronized with the European grid system. Disconnecting the plant from the Ukrainian grid and connecting it to the Russian one would require a completeand well-prepared forshutdown of the plant. It would mean a total cut-off of all power lines connected to the Ukrainian system. Russia has not denied its plan to connect Crimea, and, on August 25, the plants workers said Russian forces deliberately damaged the high-voltage power lines that connect the ZNPP to Ukraines grid network.\n\nHowever, for safe operation, a nuclear power plant must continuously transmit the power it generates to the grid system; otherwise, emergency protection systems are activated that shut the reactors down. A blackout also turns the cooling system off, leaving diesel generators as the only system available to continue operating the pumps. This is precisely what happened at the plant on August 25 when all the power lines were cut off due to the ongoing military activity near the plant and automatic safety systems shut down the two reactors (units 5 and 6) that were still operating. After the loss of power, the diesel generators started, and the cooling system continued working, which prevented a nuclear catastrophe. If the generators had failed, without any power supply and thus cooling, the meltdown would have started after only 90 minutes.\n\nFollowing the incident, Energoatom said both reactors have been reconnected to the Ukrainian grid. However, the generators can run for a limited time in an emergency, and the situation requires restoring the external power supply as soon as possible. The condition of the generators is itself unknown; the IAEA mission will have to check if they are in working condition. There is also a question of how much diesel (fuel) is available on the site.\n\nBut a nuclear power plants safety also depends on humans to oversee that the automatic systems operate as planned. Lets not forget that the human factor played a significant role in the Chornobyl accident. Currently, the ZNPPs staff works under severe Russian pressure on top of almost daily shelling and bombing. Because of this, employees describe the psychological state of the plants workers as being critical. This greatly increases the risk of human error.\n\nThe ZNPP has been occupied since March 4, and shelling has continued since August 5, creating a multitude of risks at the nuclear facility. On that day, in particular, three projectiles landed right near one of the reactors. There were risks of hydrogen leakage and dispersal of radioactive substances, as well as a high fire hazard. The nitrogen-oxygen station and the combined auxiliary building were seriously damaged. The defense intelligence of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense also reported that, on August 13, Russian shelling damaged the first unit of a communication workshop of the pumping station and partially destroyed the fire station responsible for the safety of the ZNPP. On top of that, military trucks block access to the turbine areas on the plant, which would impede firefighting in case of emergency. As one can see, the situation at and around ZNPP is volatile and precarious, which poses significant radiation risks due to the militarization of the facility by the Russian occupying forces.\n\nDiaz-Maurin: What can we expect from a UNs International Atomic Energy Agency mission or a team of outside nuclear experts visit of the ZNPP? To what extent, this could help determine the level of the risksand reduce those risksfor long as Russia occupies the site?\n\nHesse: On August 11, Ukraine demanded a declaration from Russia that it accepts the IAEA mission without any preconditions. According to the demand, Russia had to abide not to obstruct the passage of the mission throughout Ukrainian territory, demine the plant, and withdraw its troops, weapons, and equipment from the plant. It took several weeks for Russia to accept the first demand, which it did on August 27. The IAEA mission is currently on its visit to the plant, which is led by IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi himself.\n\nIn August 23, the UNs Security Council determined that it has the \"logistics and security capacity in Ukraine to support any IAEA mission to the [Zaporizhzhia] plant from Kyiv, provided Ukraine and Russia agree.\"\n\nDiaz-Maurin: What about a call for withdrawing Russian forces from the nuclear power plant or establishing a demilitarized zone around the plant?\n\nHesse: Clearly, the only way to ensure the safety of the plant is to remove Russian forces from its premises and establish a demilitarized zone in the surrounding area. This would enable the IAEA team to travel safely to the facility, conduct an inspection, and assess the nuclear safety, security, and application of safeguards at the ZNPP.\n\nHowever, Russia keeps rejecting such a proposal. It is simply not in their interest because they know that the IAEAs position is that Ukraine has a sovereign right to the station and surrounding territory. First, Russia is concerned that demilitarizing the plant would make it more \"vulnerable,\" for example, enabling the IAEA to get control over the plant, which then could give the control back over to Ukraine. Second, the militarization of the ZNPP gives Russia powerful leverage since Ukrainian troops will have a hard time retaking the Zaporizhzhia region if Russian troops set up a military base that Ukraine forces cannot target.\n\nOn top of that, the leverage is also in creating provocations at the plant and blaming the Ukrainian side for those. There have also been reports of false flag operations, like when Russians brought a Pion with \"Z\" inscriptions under a Ukrainian flag to Energodar. All of this is supposed to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of partners and make them pressure Ukraine to negotiate as quickly as possible. The threat of an uncontrolled transborder radiation release potentially reaching other European countries creates this sense of urgency. Third, the ZNPP would be a crucial energy source for occupied Crimea and southern Ukraine. The plant is beneficial for Russia while it is occupying those territories. Additionally, depriving Ukraine from 20 percent of its domestic electricity production creates extra pressure, especially with the anticipated energy crisis this coming winter.\n\nDiaz-Maurin: Some have qualified Russias actions as \"nuclear terrorism.\" What do they mean by that?\n\nHesse: According to the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (2005), the actor falls under the definition of being a nuclear terrorist if it \"uses in any way radioactive material or a device, or uses or damages a nuclear facility in a manner which releases or risks the release of radioactive material: (i) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or (ii) With the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the environment; or (iii) With the intent to compel a natural or legal person, an international organization or a State to do or refrain from doing an act.\" The text notes that the activities of military forces of states are governed outside of the framework of the Convention. However, it emphasizes that it does not make lawful otherwise unlawful acts or preclude prosecution under other laws.\n\nEarlier, the International Court of Justices Advisory Opinion of July 8, 1996, provided another explanation for considering existing international treaties and instruments. These included Additional Protocol 1 of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, Article 35, paragraph 3, which prohibits the employment of \"methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment;\" Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration of 1972 and Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration of 1992, which charge states with a duty \"to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\" These principles apply at all times, being war or peace.\n\nIf a catastrophe happens at ZNPP, the consequences would be widespread and have transboundary effects. The threat of an accident at Zaporizhzhia arose because of the actions of the Russian Federation which turned the nuclear power plant into a military object. So if an accident happens, according to international law, it would be an act of terrorism carried out by Russia.\n\nSix months into the war, the least we can say is that Russias three-day plan to capture Ukraine did not work out. The losses in equipment and manpower are greater than expected, forcing Russia to move old weapons systems out of retirement and increase the size of its Armed Forces to avoid the so-feared general mobilization. On top of that, sanctions are crippling the Russian economy. Consequently, Russian officials have been using negotiation rhetoric more frequently. For now, Putin wants to settle the status quo now that Ukraines position has been strong and even pushing to regain territory. But any negotiation on the status quo will only be a temporary solution until Russia regains power and decides to proceed further. That is why the world must hold Russia responsible for committing acts of nuclear terrorism, continue pressing Putin to de-militarize the plant, and avoid making any concessions to the aggressor.",

Although most of the team left the plant after two days, it said two of its officials would remain there on a permanent basis.\n\nIn an emergency session of the Security Council, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres set out steps for the creation of a demilitarised zone around the plant.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed calls by the IAEA for a safety protection zone at Zaporizhzhia.\n\nPetro Kotyn, who runs Ukraine's nuclear agency Energoatom, suggested a UN peacekeeping contingent could set up a security zone at Zaporizhzhia and Russian troops withdraw.\n\nIn its report, the nuclear agency highlighted the \"extremely stressful conditions\" facing the 907 Ukrainian staff working there under Russian military control.\n\nHowever, the IAEA was careful not to apportion blame to either side.\n\nThe IAEA's report says that there were Russian military vehicles stationed in two turbine halls and under the overpass connecting the reactor units and includes a photo showing Russian-flagged military trucks with the Z insignia parked inside a large building.\n\nOn Wednesday Mr Putin denied that there was any Russian military equipment on-site at Zaporizhzhia.\n\nSeparately, the head of Ukraine's nuclear security agency told a news conference that the site is currently disconnected from the electricity grid following shelling and that Ukraine was considering shutting it down for safety reasons.\n\nWhile the nuclear plant is currently able to generate the electricity it needs to run its own cooling systems, should that cease to be the case it would be reliant on back-up diesel-powered generators.\n\nThe generators require four tanks of diesel a day, Oleh Korikov said, and it would be very difficult to replenish stocks across the front line.\n\nTuesday's report from the IAEA detailed the damage to the plant and said that while continued shelling had not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it did present a constant threat to safety that \"may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance\".\n\nThere was an urgent need for \"interim measures\" to prevent a nuclear accident caused by military action, it added, saying all relevant parties would have to agree to a \"nuclear safety and security protection zone\" being set up to avoid further damage.\n\nThe plant lies on the southern bank of the River Dnieper, across the water from Ukrainian-held towns and military positions.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK's Ministry of Defence says fighting has continued in Ukraine on three fronts over the past 24 hours: in the east, in Donbas; in the north around Kharkiv, and in the south around Kherson.",

                "cc_text": "The UN secretary general, Antnio Guterres, has called for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in.\n\nGuterres was addressing a UN security council session on Tuesday, at which he supported the recommendations put forward Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who led an inspection visit to the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant last week, and presented a report to the security council. The report confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers and military equipment at the plant, including army vehicles.\n\n\"We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place. This is why in our report, we are proposing the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone limited to the perimeter and the plant itself,\" Grossi said.\n\nGuterres said that, as a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces should cease all military operations around the plant.\n\n\"As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarised perimeter should be secured,\" he added. \"Specifically, that will include the commitment by Russian forces to withdraw military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and the commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move in.\"\n\n00:12:43 The Ukrainians living on a nuclear frontline: This is inhumanity video\n\nUkraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, offered qualified support for Grossis proposal to create a demilitarised zone around the plant and asked for more detail on the plan.\n\n\"If the content of this proposal is to demilitarise the territory of the nuclear power plant and this is logical, as it was the Russian military presence that put the Zaporizhzhia plant on the brink of a radiation disaster - then we can support such a demilitarised protection zone,\" he said.\n\nThe Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, blamed recent shelling of the plant on Ukraine and portrayed Russian forces as protecting the plant. He did not respond to the call for a security zone, a proposal Moscow has so far rejected. Nebenzya said he had not had time to read the IAEA report.\n\nThe IAEA report presented on Tuesday said the agency was \"gravely concerned\" about the \"unprecedented\" situation at the plant, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian technicians, and urged interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster.\n\nThe report came as a Russian colonel who served as the military commandant of the occupied Ukrainian city of Berdiansk was reported to have been killed in a car bombing, according to Russian state media reports.\n\nThe car bomb reportedly exploded near the city administrative headquarters, which is being used as a Russian base. Photographs showed that the car used by the Russian military official, who has been identified as Col Artyom Bardin, was severely damaged in the attack, which took place close to midday.\n\nInitial reports indicated that Bardin died from his wounds. But Vladimir Rogov, the Russian-appointed administrative head of the Zaporizhzhia region, said in a Telegram post written just after 8.30pm on Tuesday that the colonel continued to \"fight for his life\".\n\n\"Thank God, information about the death of the commandant of Berdyansk Artyom Bardin is not confirmed. Despite severe injuries, explosive leg amputation and massive blood loss, he is alive. Doctors continue to fight for his life,\" he said.\n\nRussian officials have alleged that Ukrainewas behind the attack. If true, it would be the most significant assassination yet of an official working for the occupational government of Russia in Ukraine.\n\nAt least two Ukrainians collaborating with the Russian government were killed in suspected partisan attacks in August. In one case, the deputy head of the Russian-installed military administration was shot to death in his home in the city of Nova Kakhovka. In late August, a Ukrainian politician from Volodymyr Zelenskiys party who had gone over to work with the Russians was killed in the Kherson region.\n\nUkrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available, the report said. \"This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety,\" it added.\n\nBritains ambassador to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, told the security council the Zaporizhzhia staff were \"no longer workers, but hostages being held at gunpoint.\"\n\nRussian troops seized control of the site in early March and there have been repeated attacks in the vicinity, prompting fears of a nuclear disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have denied responsibility and the report did not ascribe blame for the damage its inspectors had discovered.\n\nThe UN agency sent a 14-person team to the site last week, including its director general, Rafael Grossi, to assess the situation at the plant. At least two members of the team are to remain there on a permanent basis to ensure the facilitys safety.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you whats happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moscow repeated its longstanding accusations that Ukrainian forces had been shelling the plant.\n\nKyiv says it is Russia that has been staging such incidents, to undermine international support for Ukraine and as a possible pretext to cut the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and steal its output.\n\n00:00:54 Integrity of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant 'violated several times', says IAEA head video\n\nOn the battleground in the east of the country on Tuesday, three civilians were killed in Russian rocket attacks in the Kharkiv region, a senior official said.\n\nIn the past week the focus of fighting has shifted to the south, where Ukraine has started a long-awaited counterattack to recapture territory seized early in the war.\n\nUkrainian officials posted an image online of three soldiers raising Ukraines flag on a rooftop in Vysokopyllya, in the north of Kherson. If confirmed, it could mark perhaps the most strategic breakthrough on the battlefield in the counteroffensive.",

The attacks occur as Russias war on Ukraine moves into its seventh month, with no end in sight.\n\nThe resolution also \"notes with concern\" the report by the agencys Director-General Rafael Grossi on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which was published after the agencys experts assessed the situation on the ground on Sept. 1. But the resolution falls short of directly calling for the establishment of a demilitarized safety zone around the plant, one of the main recommendations contained in the document.\n\nDiplomats in Vienna say that there is not enough clarity about the details of such a safety zone and what it would exactly entail. The UN secretary-general, Antnio Guterres, has also called for a demilitarized zone as well as Russias withdrawal from the plant. President Volodymr Zelensky has said he would back such a plan, but when reporters asked Russias ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, about it recently, he dismissed the possibility.\n\nPassBlue Related Articles You might be interested in these posts.

A specific formulation on Grossis recommendation to establish a safety zone is still under negotiation.\n\nPoland and Canada have continuously pushed for such a resolution in the past few weeks. They were the driving force behind the first resolution on nuclear safety at Ukraine plants. It was adopted on March 3 at an emergency meeting of the agencys board of governors in Vienna.\n\nOne diplomat with knowledge of the situation said that the current resolution was a \"first step to begin codifying the seven pillars of nuclear safety and security,\" outlined by Grossi in March. \"It is the duty of the IAEA board to say something about this situation,\" the diplomat added.\n\nAnother diplomat said that the resolution was a way of clearly supporting the efforts by the agency to protect the safety of nuclear power plants amid the war against Ukraine, as well as a \"diplomatic instrument to exert pressure on Russia.\"\n\nThe new draft resolution will be voted on at next weeks quarterly IAEA board of governors meeting, held Sept. 12-16. For the resolution to be passed, a simple majority of the 35-member body is required. It is expected that Russia and China will vote against the resolution and that there will be a few abstentions. But diplomats expect the resolution to pass easily.\n\nIt comes after a long-awaited, risky mission by a team of 14 IAEA experts, including Grossi, to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia plant in southeastern Ukraine on Sept. 1.\n\nThe UN convoy of the mission avoided traveling through Russian-occupied territory and instead went through Ukraine, starting in its capital, Kyiv. It included driving through an active war zone and encountering a delay of several hours at a Ukrainian checkpoint amid intense shelling. \"Having come this far, I was not going to stop and with my courageous team we moved in. There were moments where fire was obvious,\" Grossi told reporters in Ukraine afterward.\n\nGrossi and his team inspected the plant for about four hours. He told reporters after his return to Vienna, where the IAEA is based, that he could see everything he needed to see. Two IAEA experts are staying at the plant indefinitely, he said.\n\nIn the report released on Sept. 6, the IAEA calls for establishing a \"nuclear safety and security protection zone\" around the atomic power plant, the biggest in Europe, with six reactors. The report also says that \"shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant\" but stopped short of blaming either parties in the war for the damage at the plant.\n\nThe report details the damage as well as the potential catastrophic risks, including a possible \"severe nuclear accident.\" The plant has been continuously shelled since it was seized by Russian forces in a dramatic assault on March 4, soon after the war began on Feb. 24.\n\nBriefing the UN Security Council on Sept. 7 remotely, Grossi reiterated his warning, saying that \"we are playing with fire and something very catastrophic could take place.\"\n\nThe constant shelling has led to the plant being disconnected from all of its external power grids. Shelling also took place while members of the IAEA team were inspecting the plant, forcing them to evacuate to the ground floor of an administrative building.\n\nNuclear power plants rely on external electricity to power critical cooling systems for their reactors and spent fuel pools. If cooling is interrupted and not restored quickly, a nuclear meltdown is likely to occur, which is similar to what happened at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011. Such an incident would have potentially disastrous radioactive consequences for Ukraine and far beyond.\n\nAfter having been disconnected from all external grids, the Zaporizhzhia plant began running on power that is generated by its own reactor, No. 6, the only one still operating.\n\nReferring to this situation, Edwin Lyman, a nuclear power expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Cambridge, Mass., told PassBlue that he did not think that this mode \"is safe for long-term operation.\"\n\n\"I have concerns about this so-called island mode where Unit 6 is running at very low power to provide electricity to the other units and to its own cooling and safety systems. Although some plants around the world have been analyzed and approved for operating in this mode, I havent found any evidence that is true for Zaporizhzhia,\" he said.\n\n\"If the plant is to continue operating, there is no alternative to creation of a demilitarized zone that would allow the offsite power lines to be repaired and secured from future damage,\" Lyman added.\n\nIn an interview with PassBlue, Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California, echoed this concern. \"Loss of outside power is one of the most dreadful things that can happen to a nuclear plant,\" Meshkati said. He thinks that the remaining reactor should be brought to a \"cold shutdown\" to avoid further catastrophe.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant is equipped with 20 emergency diesel generators containing 2,250 tons of diesel fuel that can be used in case all other power supplies break down. However, the generators can operate only for a limited period of time, and due to the heavy fighting around the plant, it is not guaranteed that the fuel can be resupplied fast enough.\n\nMeshkati is also particularly worried about the difficult conditions of Ukrainian staff working at the plant under the constant supervision of Russian nuclear experts from the Russian nuclear energy corporation Rosatom. The IAEA report says that the Ukrainian personnel are \"subject to constant high stress and pressure\" while operating the plant, saying that this is \"not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications on nuclear safety.\"\n\nMeshkati, who has 35 years of research experience in nuclear safety and has visited more than 16 nuclear power plants around the world, including Fukushima, Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, says that \"factors such as stress and fatigue significantly increase human error probability.\"\n\n\"It really chills me to the bone,\" he said.\n\nWe welcome your\n\nWe welcome your comments on this article .

Both Moscow and Kyiv have denied responsibility.\n\nThe IAEA said on Saturday that the plant had been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and was relying on a reserve line.\n\nThe long-awaited report did not ascribe blame for damage at the plant. Inspectors said they had found Russian troops and equipment at the plant, including military vehicles parked in turbine halls. They also said conditions for the plants Ukrainian staff should be improved to reduce the likelihood of errors.\n\n\"Ukrainian staff operating the plant under Russian military occupation are under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available,\" the IAEA report said. \"This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety.\"\n\nNajmedin Meskati, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California and who has worked on nuclear safety for 35 years, told Al Jazeera the reports findings on the mental health of the staff were \"very scary\".\n\nReading out from the report and highlighting comments such as \"unbelievable pressure\" and \"friction in decision making\" when dealing with Russian troops, he said: \"These are all, unfortunately, a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nAddressing the UN Security Council after Grossis presentation, Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said, \"We regret that in your report the source of the shelling is not directly named.\"\n\n\"We do understand your position as an international regulator, but in the current situation, its very important to call things by their name,\" he said.\n\nShelling continues\n\nShelling continued around the site on Tuesday, a day after it was again knocked off Ukraines electrical grid and put in the precarious position of relying on its own power to run its safety systems.\n\nRussian-installed officials accused Ukrainian forces of shelling Enerhodar, the city where the plant is situated, while the Ukrainians said Kremlin forces attacked the city of Nikopol, across the Dnieper River from the power station.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, reported that a powerful blast struck the city of 53,000 at about midday. The explosion left Enerhodar cut off from its power and water supplies. It was not immediately clear what caused the blast.\n\nWorld leaders have called for the demilitarisation of the plant, which is being run by Ukrainian engineers.\n\nTwo inspectors from the IAEA mission remained at the plant, a decision welcomed by Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.\n\n\"There are Russian troops now who dont understand whats happening, dont assess the risks correctly,\" Podolyak said. \"There is a number of our workers there, who need some kind of protection, people from the international community standing by their side and telling [Russian troops]: Dont touch these people, let them work.\"\n\nOn Monday, the IAEA said Ukrainian authorities reported that the plants last transmission line linking it to the nations power grid was disconnected to allow workers to put out a fire caused by shelling.\n\nUkrainian energy minister Herman Halushchenko told Ukrainian television, \"Any repairs are impossible at this point there are ongoing hostilities around the plant.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the plants only remaining operational reactor will \"generate the power the plant needs for its safety and other functions\", the IAEA said. The plant normally relies on outside power to run the critical cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel and avoid a meltdown.\n\nExperts say the reactors at Zaporizhzhia are designed to withstand natural disasters and even plane crashes, but the unpredictable fighting has repeatedly threatened to disrupt the cooling systems.",

Ukraines nuclear energy operator, Energoatom confirmed on its Telegram channel that the reactivated reactor had been plugged back into the power grid.\n\nThe head of Ukraines powerful National Security Council said work was under way to ensure Ukraines power supply in case connection to the Zaporizhzhia site is lost this winter. Oleksiy Danilov also said Ukrainian authorities werent fully aware of the situation inside the plant for now despite the presence of the team from the U.N.s International Atomic Energy Agency that went in Thursday.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Danilov a key official in Ukraines war effort said Kyiv didnt know whether the plant might have been mined by the Russians, adding: \"I want to emphasize that this is a challenge for the whole world, how to make this nuclear facility not dangerous.\"\n\nAleksandr Volga, the Kremlin-backed mayor of Enerhodar, where the Zaporizhizhia nuclear power plant is located, told the Interfax news agency Friday that the successful reactivation left the plant with two working reactors, out of a total of six.\n\nRussia and Ukraine traded blame for the shelling attack which led to Thursdays temporary shutdown of the reactor by its emergency protection system. Energoatom said the shelling damaged a backup power supply line used for in-house needs, and one of the plants reactors that wasnt operating was switched to diesel generators.\n\nBritains Defense Ministry said earlier Friday that shelling continued in the area near the power plant, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyys office said Russian shelling damaged houses, gas pipelines and other infrastructure in the Nikopol region on the other bank of the Dnieper River part of fighting in several areas of eastern and southern Ukraine overnight.\n\nThe IAEA, braving gunfire and artillery blasts along their route, crossed the frontlines to reach the Zaporizhzhia plant on Thursday.\n\nRussia and Ukraine traded accusations that the other side was trying to impede the work of the IAEA experts, or control the message.\n\nZelenskyy, in his nightly address on Thursday, had tough words for the IAEA delegation. While applauding its arrival at the plant, he said independent journalists were kept from covering the visit, allowing Russians to present a one-sided, \"futile tour.\"\n\nIn a conference call with reporters on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow considered \"positively\" the arrival of the mission, \"despite all problems and difficulties caused by the Ukrainian sides provocative actions.\"\n\nThe 14-member delegation arrived in a convoy of SUVs and vans after months of negotiations to enable the experts to pass through the front lines.\n\nGrossi said Friday that six of the agencys experts remain at the plant, and there will be a \"permanent presence on site with two of our experts who will be continuing the work.\" He wasnt specific about how long exactly the two experts will stay.\n\n\"The difference between being there and not being there is like day and night,\" he said.\n\nThe plant has been occupied by Russian forces but run by Ukrainian engineers since the early days of the 6-month war.\n\nUkraine alleges Russia is using the plant as a shield to launch attacks. On Friday, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu rejected the Ukrainian allegations and said Russia has no heavy weapons either on the site or in nearby areas.\n\nShoigu said Ukrainian forces have fired 120 artillery shells and used 16 suicide drones to hit the plant, \"raising a real threat of a nuclear catastrophe in Europe.\"\n\nBefore the IAEA team arrived, Energoatom, Ukraines state nuclear power company, said Russian mortar shelling had led to the shutdown of one of its reactors by its emergency protection system and had damaged a backup power supply line used for in-house needs.\n\nEnergoatom on Friday accused Russian forces of \"making every effort\" to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the facts on the ground.\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine on Friday, Zelenskyys office said four people were killed and 10 injured over the last day in the eastern Donetsk region, a key hub of the Russian invasion.\n\n___ Joanna Kozlowska in London and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.\n\nYesica Fisch, The Associated Press",

The long-awaited visit by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to the Russian-occupied nuclear plant in south-eastern Ukraine would be successful if it led to the \"demilitarisation\" of the facility, Petro Kotin, the head of the Ukrainian state energy company Energoatom, said in an interview with Reuters. Ukraines top priority was to demilitarise the plant and the surrounding area in order to avoid a nuclear accident, he said. Kotin said: If this mission helps to do that, then it will be successful. He said the fact that the IAEA mission had been able to visit the nuclear plant after months of negotiation marked progress, but accused Russia of trying to propagandise the visit by excluding independent journalists.\n\nUpdated at 13.06 EDT\n\n1 Sept 2022 12.18 EDT Russian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians to Russia or areas of Ukraine under their control, according to Human Rights Watch. Ukrainian civilians, including those fleeing hostilities, are being \"left with no choice but to go to Russia\", the rights organisation warned in a report. The report documents the transfers of Ukrainian civilians, many of whom were fleeing the devastated port city of Mariupol. Others were from the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine. One woman transferred from Mariupol told the organisation: Of course, we would have used the opportunity to go to Ukraine if we could have. But we had no choice, no possibility to go. Forced transfers are \"a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity\", HRW said. It added: Russian and Russian-affiliated authorities also subjected thousands of Ukrainian citizens to a form of compulsory, punitive, and abusive security screening called \"filtration\". Another civilian from Mariupol said that, after being detained by Russian troops, he and dozens of others were held \"like hostages\" in a village schoolhouse for two weeks under filthy conditions before undergoing filtration.\n\nUpdated at 12.32 EDT\n\n1 Sept 2022 12.05 EDT Ukraines state nuclear company, Energoatom, has confirmed that the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, has left the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

Each night residents go to sleep not knowing if they will wake up. World leaders have expressed increasing alarm at Europes largest nuclear plant becoming a war zone. Any radiation leak could be catastrophic for Ukraine and the wider continent. Kyiv says Russian forces are using the plant as a shield, hiding military equipment there knowing they cannot be targeted. Moscow claims Ukraine is shelling the plant and its surroundings.

The situation around the Russian-held nuclear power plant remains \"a mess\", CNN cites Halushchenko as saying in Novooleksandrivka in the Zaporizhzhia region, where he accompanied the IAEA delegation before they travelled on to the Russian-occupied territory. Halushchenko said he told the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, that security is \"your own responsibility\". Grossi seemed \"confident to assume the risk,\" he added. He also said: Ukraine fulfilled all international obligations and gave every possibility for this mission to come. The Ukrainian minister said he understood the IAEA mission has \"some security agreement with the Russians\" and suggested several members of the team would stay onsite \"for several days\". Grossi is due to arrive back in Novooleksandrivka today, he added.\n\n1 Sept 2022 09.35 EDT Isobel Koshiw Isobel Koshiw reports for the Guardian from Borodianka: The children and teachers gathered on the grass outside School Number 2 in Borodianka on Thursday morning for the first day of the academic year. There were speeches and a recital of the Ukrainian national anthem, and as is traditional the girls wore white scrunchies in their hair, the boys white shirts. They brought flowers to give to their teachers. But there will be no lessons in the classrooms of School Number 2 this year. Borodianka, a town just north of Kyiv, was occupied by Russian forces in March. The invading soldiers used the school as a base, before trashing it as they left. The teachers and children at School Number 2 in Borodianka. Photograph: Isobel Koshiw/The Guardian The teachers described returning to the school after it was liberated and finding the soldiers had used several classrooms as toilets, left rubbish everywhere and needlessly destroyed whiteboards, PE equipment, TVs and computers. They also graffitied anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian slogans on the walls and dug trenches behind the school. The speeches on Thursday morning stuck to familiar themes of defiance against the odds and freeing Ukraine of the \"enemy\". They ended with a minutes silence for those who have died defending the country. After the ceremony, the teachers and students returned home to start their lessons on their smartphones and laptops. Only year 1 will be learning in person, joining another first-year class at the only school in the town left undamaged.

The British prime minister was asked about the risks of the Zaporizhzhia plant after delivering a speech in Sizewell in Suffolk. Johnson said: Its clearly the objective of the Russians about which they are absolutely ... explicit ... they want to unplug it from the Ukrainian grid and plug it into the Russian grid. And there are much greater nuclear experts than me in this room Im told that that has all sorts of risks, doing something like that. We dont want to take any risk with Zaporizhzhia. He added: I think its important that Mr Grossi and the IAEA are allowed to get into it and do their inspection. But Ive got to tell you I think that Zaporizhzhia is a Ukrainian plant and the Ukrainians should have it back in their control.\n\nUpdated at 08.27 EDT",

Arriving in a convoy of SUVs and vans, the inspectors were led by IAEA director Rafael Grossi.\n\nAs the experts made their way toward the complex, Russia and Ukraine accused each other of shelling the area and trying to derail the visit. The heavy shelling delayed the teams progress toward the plant.\n\nWATCH: Fighting in southern Ukraine raises concerns over nuclear plant occupied by Russian forces\n\nEnergoatom, Ukraines state nuclear power company, said Russian mortar shelling had led to the shutdown of one of its reactors by its emergency protection system and had damaged a backup power supply line used for in-house needs. One of the plants reactors that wasnt operating was switched to diesel generators, Energoatom said.\n\n\"There has been increased military activity, including this morning until very recently,\" Grossi said during the journey, adding that after being briefed by the Ukrainian military he decided to keep moving despite the risks. \"Weighing the pros and cons and having come so far, we are not stopping.\"\n\nGrossi, who personally negotiated with Ukrainian authorities to allow the teams passage, noted earlier that the risks were \"very, very high\" in the so-called gray zone between Ukrainian and Russian positions, but \"we consider that we have the minimum conditions to move.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow expects \"impartiality\" from the team.\n\n\"We are taking all the necessary measures to ensure that the plant is secure, that it functions safely and that the mission accomplishes all of its plans there,\" he said.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant has been occupied by Russian forces but run by Ukrainian engineers since the early days of the 6-month-old war. Ukraine alleges Russia is using the plant as a shield, storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it, while Moscow accuses Ukraine of recklessly firing on the area.\n\nFighting in early March caused a brief fire at its training complex, and in recent days, the plant was briefly knocked offline because of damage, heightening fears of a radiation leak or a reactor meltdown. Officials have begun distributing anti-radiation iodine tablets to nearby residents.\n\n\"We have a very important mission to accomplish,\" Grossi said, adding that \"we are going to start immediately an assessment of the security and the safety situation at the plant.\"\n\n\"I am going to consider the possibility of establishing a continued presence of the IAEA at the plant, which we believe is indispensable to stabilize the situation and to get regular, reliable, impartial, neutral updates of what the situation is there,\" he said.\n\nRussias Defense Ministry said Ukrainian forces unleashed an artillery barrage on the area and then sent a group of up to 60 scouts to try to seize the plant on the Dnieper River. It said that the Ukrainian troops arrived in seven speedboats but that Russian forces \"took steps to destroy the enemy,\" using warplanes.\n\nRussia said some of the Ukrainian shells landed 400 meters (yards) away from the plants No. 1 reactor.\n\nThe Russian-installed administration in the city where the plant is situated, Enerhodar, said at least three residents were killed early Thursday by Ukrainian shelling.\n\nUkrainian officials, meanwhile, accused Russian forces of shelling Enerhodar and a corridor that the IAEA team was set to go through.\n\nNeither sides version of events could immediately be independently verified.\n\nThe fighting came as Ukraine endeavored to start the new school year in the middle of a war. Just over half of the countrys are reopening to in-person classes despite the risks.\n\nIn other developments, authorities with the Russian-backed separatist government in the eastern region of Donetsk said 13 emergency responders were killed by Ukrainian shelling in Rubtsi, a village in neighboring Kharkiv province. Much of the fighting in recent weeks and months has centered on the area.\n\nGatopoulos reported from Kyiv, Ukaine.",

The Russian leader described European calls for a price cap on Russian gas as \"stupid\" and said they would lead to higher global prices and economic problems in Europe. Last week, G7 countries agreed on a plan to put a ceiling on Russian oil prices in an attempt to stem the flow of funds into the Kremlins war coffers. Russia would walk away from its supply contracts if the west went ahead with its plans, Putin said. The Russian president said: Will there be any political decisions that contradict the contracts? Yes, we wont fulfill them. We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests. He added: We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil we will not supply anything. Russia \"would only have one thing left to do\", Putin said. As in the famous Russian fairytale, we would sentence the wolfs tail to be frozen. He said Germany and western countries themselves were to blame for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline not being operational and that Ukraine and Poland decided on their own to switch off other gas routes into Europe. He added: Nord Steam 1 is practically closed now.\n\nUpdated at 07.24 EDT\n\n7 Sept 2022 13.51 EDT Andrew Sparrow James Cleverly has reaffirmed the UKs \"steadfast support\" for Ukraine in his first call as foreign secretary. The Foreign Office said he spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart on Wednesday. In a statement shared on social media, Cleverly said: I just spoke to Dmytro Kuleba in my first call as foreign secretary. I reaffirmed the UKs steadfast support for Ukraine as they resist Putins barbaric invasion. What happens in Ukraine matters to us all and I will do everything possible to assist their fight for freedom.\n\n7 Sept 2022 13.49 EDT The leader of Russias governing party has proposed that a referendum should be held in occupied regions of Ukraine on 4 November on whether to become part of Russia. Andrei Turchak, head of Vladimir Putins United Russia party, said it would be \"correct and symbolic\" to hold votes on that date, a Russian public holiday which is celebrated as the Day of National Unity. Andrey Turchak, head of Putins ruling United Russia party, proposed to hold \"referenda\" on joining Russia in the Donbas and the \"liberated territories\" on 4 November, when Russia marks its Unity Day Pjotr Sauer (@PjotrSauer) September 7, 2022 Pro-Russian officials in occupied parts of Ukraine had previously suggested that a referendum on joining Russia would be held on 11 September. But on Monday, Russia-appointed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine said they are \"pausing\" a planned referendum because of attacks by Ukrainian forces. Writing on his partys website today, Turchak said that in any case, voting would \"definitely\" take place this year.\n\n7 Sept 2022 13.27 EDT Ukraine could seize Kherson by October, says former French general Ukrainian troops could be in a position to seize the entire right bank of the Dnieper River, including Kherson city, by October, according to a former French general. Ukrainian forces have methodically prepared their counterattack in the southern Kherson region, launching offensives on \"almost the entire southern frontline\", Gen Dominique Trinquand, former head of the French military mission to the UN, said in an interview with France 24. The Ukrainian counteroffensive appears to be \"progressing well\", he said, adding: The Russians seem surprised by the methods used. The destruction of ammunition depots and logistical hubs, particularly the railroads, have considerably destabilised them. Today, if the forces stationed west of the Dnieper River no longer receive shells, they will no longer be able to defend themselves. If they no longer receive food, it will be dramatic for some units. He also said: I think that before the winter, the Ukrainians could take over the whole right bank of the Dnieper, including the city of Kherson. If Ukraine succeeded in retaking this region, it would be a \"major coup\" and would be \"very damaging\" for Vladimir Putin, he added.\n\n7 Sept 2022 13.16 EDT Russian natural gas deliveries to the EU have dropped by 48% so far this year, according to the Russian gas giant Gazprom. Russia is in talks about a major infrastructure project to deliver gas to China via Mongolia, Vladimir Putin said earlier today. Gazprom has for years explored the possibility of supplying gas to China via Mongolia through a gas pipeline, the Power of Siberia 2. The proposed pipeline could carry 50bn cubic metres of natural gas a year, Gazprom has said, which is slightly less than the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that links Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. In a televised meeting with Mongolias prime minister, Luvsannamsrai Oyun-Erdene, Putin said: We are in discussions about the possible implementation of a major infrastructure project, I mean the supply of Russian gas to China via Mongolia.\n\nUpdated at 13.26 EDT\n\n7 Sept 2022 12.37 EDT The Kyiv Independents defence reporter, Illia Ponomarenko, has said \"something incredible\" is happening in the north-east Kharkiv region. Ukraines counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region is reportedly seeing some success. On Tuesday, a Moscow-appointed official in the Russian-controlled Donetsk Peoples Republic said Ukrainian forces had \"encircled\" Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. Something incredible is happening in Kharkiv Oblast.\n\nYeah, we somewhat underestimated the Ukrainian militarys offensive capability and reserves in that sector. Illia Ponomarenko (@IAPonomarenko) September 7, 2022 The Wall Street Journals Yaroslav Trofimov reports that the speed of Ukraines advance has left many stunned. Lots of videos of Russian POWs (including a lieutenant-colonel) and abandoned Russian positions coming from the Balakliya-Izyum front as Russian military bloggers and analysts remain in doomsday mode.

Since launching its counteroffensive last week, Ukrainian forces have made gains in the south with ambitious ground assaults after sustained attacks on command posts, ammunition stores, and fuel reserves far behind the frontlines, according to geolocation of video and satellite imagery. The US has seen Ukraine achieve some success in attacking Russian supply lines, with the intention of cutting off and isolating Russian troops currently deployed west of the Dnipro River, according to a senior US official. According to Ukrainian officials, the goal is to take at least all territory north or west of the Dnipro River, including not only the city of Kherson but also Nova Kakhovka. Nova Kakhovka houses an important hydroelectric plant as well as a canal that supplies Crimea with much of its water. At the same time, Ukraine has stepped up attacks in the east of the country in order to prevent Russia from shifting forces to the south to attempt to repel the Ukrainian counteroffensive there, according to US officials. Ukraines goal of recapturing Kherson by the end of 2022 is ambitious but possible, US officials said.\n\nUpdated at 12.26 EDT\n\n7 Sept 2022 11.38 EDT Residents urged to evacuate from Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant town Ukraines deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged residents of Russian-occupied areas around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to evacuate for their own safety. In a post on Telegram, Vereshchuk said: I appeal to the residents of the districts adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant evacuate! Find a way to get to (Ukrainian) controlled territory.

An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk Peoples Republic said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces \"encircled\" Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. \"Today, the Ukrainian armed forces, after prolonged artillery preparation began an attack on Balakliia,\" Daniil Bezsonov said on Telegram. \"At this time, Balakliia is in operative encirclement and within the firing range of Ukrainian artillery. All approaches are cut off by fire,\" he said, adding that a successful Ukrainian offensive would threaten Russian forces in Izium, a strategically important town that Russia has been using for its own offensive in eastern Ukraine. Unverified footage circulating on social media on Wednesday showed what looked like a Ukrainian soldier posing in front of the entrance sign for Balakliia. Analysts have said that the initial target of the offensive could be the city of Kupyansk, a key road hub for Russian supplies heading south from the border into eastern Ukraine.

A local official told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the city of Nikopol on the opposite bank if the Dnieper river from Zaporizhzhia was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery. The report has not been independently verified. Regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said: There are fires, blackouts and other things at the [plant] that force us to prepare the local population for the consequences of the nuclear danger. In recent days, residents have been given iodine pills to help protect them from a radiation leak. The head of the UNs International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, warned the UN Security Council on Tuesday that \"something very, very catastrophic could take place\" at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA urged Russia and Ukraine to establish a \"nuclear safety and security protection zone\" around the plant. It is feared that fighting could lead to a disaster on the scale of Chernobyl.

Security Council, of which Russia is one of five permanent members with veto power, on Tuesday.\n\nAs the U.N. summarized:\n\nThe report proposes setting up a nuclear safety and security protection zone that would be limited to the perimeter and the plant itself.\n\nOther recommendations call for removing all military vehicles and equipment from nuclear buildings at the site and ensuring the return to clear and routine responsibilities for staff, in addition to re-establishing an \"appropriate\" work environment.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday endorsed the recommendations outlined in the IAEA report, reiterating his call for Russian and Ukrainian forces to cease fighting near Zaporizhzhia--where repeated shelling in recent weeks has sparked fears of a far-reaching disaster--and for the creation of a demilitarized perimeter around the facility.\n\n\"Any damage, whether intentional or not, to Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia--or to any other nuclear facility in Ukraine--could spell catastrophe, not only for the immediate vicinity, but for the region and beyond,\" said Guterres. \"All steps must be taken to avoid such a scenario.\"\n\n\"Common sense and cooperation must guide the way forward,\" Guterres continued. \"Any action that might endanger the physical integrity, safety, or security of the nuclear plant is unacceptable.\"\n\n\"As a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces must commit not to engage in any military activity towards the plant site or from the plant site,\" said the U.N. chief. \"The Zaporizhzhia facility and its surroundings must not be a target or a platform for military operations.\"\n\n\"As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarized perimeter should be secured,\" he added. \"Specifically, that would include a commitment by Russian forces to withdraw all military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and a commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move into it.\"\n\nIn addition, \"operators at the plant must be able to carry out their responsibilities, and communications must be maintained,\" said Guterres. \"Now is the time to urgently agree on concrete measures to ensure the safety of the area.\"\n\nA pair of IAEA inspectors will remain stationed indefinitely at Zaporizhzhia, where Ukrainian technicians have been working under the control of Russian soldiers since March.\n\n\"I trust that the IAEA experts now deployed to Zaporizhzhia will be able to carry out their work without hindrance and contribute to ensuring lasting nuclear safety and security in the plan,\" said Guterres. \"All of us have a stake in the success of their critical mission.\"",

                "cc_text": "The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called today for the creation of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the embattled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, warning the Security Council of a potential catastrophe should the facility sustain further physical assault amid reports of shelling.\n\n\"We are playing with fire,\" Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned, as he outlined the findings from the newly released report on the IAEAs \"historic\" Mission to Zaporizhzhia last week to assess the conditions a visit that resulted from \"painstaking\" efforts to corroborate facts observed over six months.\n\nLaying out the issues in stark terms, Mr. Grossi said the physical attacks sustained by the facility and that he personally assessed are simply unacceptable. Operators are working under \"extremely challenging\" circumstances. Military vehicles and equipment inside nuclear buildings must be removed so as not to interfere with the normal operations of the nuclear safety and security system.\n\nFurther, he said operating staff must be allowed to return to the plants routine line of authority an issue raised \"time and again\" since March, when the plant first became occupied. The off-site power line redundancy must be re-established. \"Without this, we could have a very serious nuclear accident,\" he stressed.\n\nHe pressed all parties to ensure the effective operation of supply chains, highlighting IAEA assistance and support programmes available to help re-establish them, as they did in Chernobyl. IAEA can also help monitor radiation systems, he said, stressing that all reliable means of communications must also be restored. \"We are ready to consult quickly with the parties,\" he said. The report is considered an interim step until longer-term measures can be put in place.\n\nIn line with those remarks, United Nations Secretary-General Antnio Guterres said any damage, whether intentional or not, to Europes largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia could spell catastrophe, adding that \"all steps must be taken to avoid such a scenario\".\n\nAs a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces must commit not to engage in any military activity towards or from the plant site, he said. It must not be a target or a platform for military operations. As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarized perimeter should be secured. Specifically, that would include a commitment by Russian forces to withdraw all military personnel and equipment from that perimeter, and a commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move into it.\n\nHe trusted that the IAEA experts now deployed to Zaporizhzhia would be able to carry out their work without hindrance, he said. \"All of us have a stake in the success of their critical mission.\"\n\nTaking the floor first in the ensuing debate, the Russian Federations representative said the visit offered IAEA an opportunity to see that the only threats were those from the shelling and sabotage by Ukrainian armed forces. This was evident in the Director Generals statement of concern over the plants physical integrity. \"It is important that you were able to see with your own eyes that, thanks to cooperation between ZNPP staff and the Russian armed forces protecting the station, it is functioning normally,\" he said.\n\nMost other delegations welcomed that the Mission could finally take place and that IAEA now has an ongoing presence at Zaporizhzhia, with Germanys delegate pointing out that his country, in its national capacity and as the Group of 7 President, was among those that pushed for the IAEA Mission to be deployed as a matter of urgency.\n\nThe United States representative stressed that, despite the Russian Federations \"song and dance\", the situation stems from that countrys 4 March seizure of the plant and conduct of military operations in its vicinity. He like several of his counterparts called on the Russian Federation to end all military operations and to return full control to Ukraine.\n\nAlbanias delegate wondered aloud about the motive of the Russian Federation to attack, overrun, occupy and militarize a nuclear power plant in another country. He also questioned why that country had not agreed to establish a secure perimeter in order to avoid any incidents.\n\nTo that point, the United Kingdoms representative underscored that the situation was akin to \"playing roulette with nuclear safety\". Describing the pressure under which the Plants staff were working, she said: \"They are no longer workers, but hostages being held at gunpoint.\"\n\nNorways delegate took a step further to equate the seizure of the plant with the hostage taking of an essential source of power supply. It is totally unacceptable that a nuclear plant has become a frontline in the Russian war against Ukraine, she said.\n\nCalling for an independent, impartial investigation to establish responsibility when military activity is damaging to nuclear facilities, Gabons representative stressed his delegation \"cannot be satisfied by half measures, given the scope of the danger\". Existing rules of nuclear security must be abided to in order to ensure that the site is safe.\n\nMexicos delegate urged the Agency to continue sharing with the Council any relevant information, expressing hope that IAEAs visit and permanent presence at the plant will foster early negotiations to end hostilities in Ukraine\n\nThe representative of India, meanwhile, issued calls for diplomacy, pointing to the successful export of grains from Ukraine and food and fertilizers from the Russian Federation to make her point. \"Differences can be resolved through sustained dialogue,\" she said.\n\nTo that idea, Ukraines representative countered that the only way to remove the nuclear threat is for the Russian Federation to withdraw its weapons and troops, and to return the station to the full legitimate control of his country. Under no circumstance has Ukraine ever used forceful military actions in relation to the plant, he insisted. Only by strengthening sanctions and officially recognizing the Russian Federation as a terrorist State, at all levels, will the situation be corrected.\n\nAlso speaking today were representatives of Brazil, Ireland, United Arab Emirates, China, Ghana, Kenya and France.\n\nThe meeting began at 3:05 p.m. and ended at 4:53 p.m.\n\nBriefings\n\nANTONIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said the United Nations Secretariat stated his proud support for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in its critical task to ensure the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Thanking all colleagues assisting in the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia, especially the 13 United Nations support and security professionals who played an essential role in the deployment of the IAEA Mission, he expressed grave concern about the situation in and around the plant, including reports of recent shelling.\n\n\"Lets tell it like it is,\" he said, stressing that any damage, whether intentional or not, to Europes largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia or to any other nuclear facility in Ukraine \"could spell catastrophe\", adding that \"all steps must be taken to avoid such a scenario\". Common sense and cooperation must guide the way forward. Any action that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant is unacceptable. All efforts to re-establish the plant as purely civilian infrastructure are vital.\n\nAs a first step, he said Russian and Ukrainian forces must commit not to engage in any military activity towards the plant site or from the plant site, emphasizing that the Zaporizhzhia facility and its surroundings must not be a target or a platform for military operations. As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarized perimeter should be secured. Specifically, that would include a commitment by Russian forces to withdraw all military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and a commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move into it.\n\nFor their part, operators at the plant must be able to carry out their responsibilities, and communications must be maintained, he continued. \"Now is the time to urgently agree on concrete measures to ensure the safety of the area,\" he said, expressing regret that the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons fell victim to the war in Ukraine. While its outcome document sought to address the safety and security of nuclear power plants in armed conflict zones, including in Ukraine, the Conference failed to reach consensus on how to strengthen the Treaty. Looking ahead, he trusted that the IAEA experts now deployed to Zaporizhzhia would be able to carry out their work without hindrance and contribute to ensuring lasting nuclear safety and security at the plant. \"All of us have a stake in the success of their critical mission,\" he said. \"Let us commit to do everything we can to support them.\"\n\nRAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), presenting the Agencys report on its visit last week to the Zaporizhzhia plant, described it as the result of \"painstaking\" efforts to corroborate facts observed over six months. He outlined the findings in the context of the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety, noting that the first pillar involves not violating a plants physical integrity. \"Unfortunately [] this continues to happen,\" he said. The physical attacks sustained by the facility and that he personally assessed are simply unacceptable. \"We are playing with fire,\" he warned. \"Something very, very catastrophic could take place.\" The report thus proposes the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone, limited to the perimeter and the plant itself.\n\nHe said the second safety pillar states that all safety and security systems and equipment should operate normally. However, IAEA experts observed that operators were operating under extremely challenging circumstances, together with military equipment and vehicles in various parts. The report recommends that military vehicles and equipment that are currently inside nuclear buildings should be removed so as not to interfere with the nuclear safety and security system.\n\nThe third pillar states that the operating staff must do their jobs without undue pressures, he continued, an issue that has been raised \"time and again\" since March, when the plant was first occupied. The report recommends that the operators be allowed to return to the plants routine line of authority and that an appropriate work environment be established. The fourth pillar off-site power supply is crucially important in that a nuclear plant without external power supply may lose functionality, including for the cooling of the reactors and spent fuel. \"Without this, we could have a very serious nuclear accident,\" he pointed out. IAEA recommends that off-site power line redundancy be re-established and available at any time, and that all military activities be stopped immediately.\n\nHe said the fifth safety pillar involves uninterrupted logistical supply chains and transport to and from the site. Explaining that the Zaporizhzhia plant is the largest in Europe, requiring a constant flow of spare parts and other equipment, he recommended that all parties contribute to ensuring effective supply chains. Through IAEA assistance and support programmes, flows of supplies had been significantly re-established at Chernobyl. A similar mechanism could be applied in Zaporizhzhia, he said.\n\nOn the sixth pillar involving radiation monitoring systems he said IAEA equipment monitoring has been effective. The report recommends that the site continue ensuring this functionality, including through exercises that IAEA can help to perform. The seventh pillar states that there must be continued and reliable communications with the Ukrainian regulator. \"Weve seen, repeatedly, that these lines of communications have been interrupted,\" he said. IAEA recommends that reliable communications means and channels be secure at all times.\n\nHe described last weeks Mission as \"historic\", as it allowed IAEA to undertake a neutral, technical reading of the situation. The fact that IAEA inspectors remain at the site offers enormous value for the United Nations and international community in evaluating immediate conditions on the ground. \"This fact is unprecedented,\" he said, explaining that IAEA visits to areas undergoing difficult circumstances, such as Fukushima, had always been done \"after the fact, to pick up the pieces\". At Zaporizhzhia, by agreeing to a special safety and security protection zone, there is an opportunity to prevent certain events from happening. \"We are ready to consult quickly with the parties,\" he said, adding that the report is considered an interim step until longer-term measures can be put in place.\n\nStatements\n\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) said the IAEA visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant allowed the IAEA Director General and his team to personally assess the situation and make sure that the seven principles of safety are strictly adhered to by the Russian Federation. \"It is important that you were able to see with your own eyes that, thanks to cooperation between ZNPP staff and the Russian armed forces protecting the station, it is functioning normally and there are no internal threats to its security,\" he said. Moreover, the visit was an excellent opportunity to see that the only threats to the plant are from the shelling and sabotage from the Ukrainian armed forces. This was seen in the conclusion at the Director-Generals briefing when he said that the Agency is most concerned by the physical security and integrity of the station, the risks for which have increased due to the shelling in August. However, it was regrettable that, in the report on the safeguards implementation in Ukraine from April to September this year, the source of shelling was not directly named. While his delegation understands the Director-Generals position as head of an international regulator, in the current situation it is extremely important to call things by their name, he said.\n\nJEFFREY DELAURENTIS ( United States ) welcomed the Agencys technical report and added his support for the inspectors to continue to have unhindered and safe access to the facility. The Russian Federation should let Ukraine operators carry out all measures that they deem important to operate the plant and maintain its safety, he said, stressing that the danger is enormous. He also voiced his support for Ukraines call for demilitarization of the area surround the facility. Calling for the Russian Federation to withdraw from Ukraine, he said that despite that countrys \"song and dance\", it has no right to expose the world to unnecessary risks. The situation is a result of the Russian Federations unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and its 4 March seizure of the plant. Russian troops continue to conduct military operations around the plant, which in turn create an increased risk of a disaster. Also of concern was the disconnection of the external power line over the weekend, he noted, adding that for now, it is generating enough power to operate its cooling system. He called on the Russian Federation to end all military operations around the plant and return full control to Ukraine. Underscoring that there is no excuse for a nuclear incident, he also voiced his rejection of all attempts of the Russian Federation to take power from Ukraines electric grid. The Russian Federation alone is responsible for this crisis and can resolve it. It must respect the Charter and Ukraines sovereignty and integrity.\n\nBARBARA WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ) welcomed IAEAs ongoing presence at the Zaporizhzhia plant and thanked Ukraine for facilitating the Agencys visit. The physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times. With the publication of todays report, IAEA confirmed the presence of Russian military personnel, vehicles and equipment in the plant, she said, recalling that Russian military equipment has been as close as 60 metres from the nuclear reactors. The report also confirmed the immense pressure under which the Ukrainian staff are operating. \"They are no longer workers, but hostages being held at gunpoint,\" she insisted. By choosing to invade a nuclear power plant, the Russian Federation is \"playing roulette with nuclear safety\", she added. Any measures to ensure nuclear safety should involve the full withdrawal of Russian troops and personnel. Stressing that the situation at Zaporizhzhia is entirely of the Russian Federations making, she pointed out that its invasion has disrupted facilities across Ukraine and jeopardized the safety of millions. The Russian Federation can resolve the situation by immediately withdrawing its forces from all of Ukraine and ceasing its senseless, reckless aggression.\n\nRONALDO COSTA FILHO ( Brazil ) said the Agencys Mission to the Zaporizhzhia plant was a positive development amid a conflict in which good news has been rare. The presence of IAEA inspectors allows the international community to know the real dimension of risks to the nuclear installations safety. Avoiding a nuclear catastrophe must be a priority, he said, adding: \"We find it extremely concerning that the physical integrity of the plant has been violated repeatedly in recent weeks.\" More worrying is that the prospect that an IAEA Mission was not enough to stop the bombings. He repeated an appeal for the immediate suspension of all actions that could jeopardize the security of Zaporizhzhia before damage to the plant results in irreparable consequences to human lives, the environment and the regions safety. Attacks on nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes violate the Charter of the United Nations, international law and the Statute of the IAEA. He reminded parties of their responsibilities under multilateral instruments, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel, and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its amendment.\n\nFERIT HOXHA ( Albania ), noting that Member States know the origin of the problem, asked: \"What is the business of Russia to attack, overrun, occupy and militarize a nuclear power plant in another country? Who is responsible in the first place that there is fighting in the surroundings of the power plant? Why has Russia not answered for demilitarizing that plant, hand it over to those it belongs Ukraine and agree to establish a secure perimeter in order to avoid any incidents?\" A clear and straightforward answer to those questions would help provide more clarity, he said, calling on the Russian Federation to withdraw its military forces and all other unauthorized personnel from the Zaporizhzhia plant, its immediate surroundings, and all of Ukraine. Voicing concern that the widespread infrastructure damage and loss of off-site electricity could damage the cooling systems and lead to a nuclear meltdown, he condemned any act of violence perpetrated inside or near the plant or against its personnel. He also called for the immediate implementation of the IAEAs recommendation to establish a secure perimeter around that facility and other nuclear facilities in Ukraine.\n\nCAIT MORAN ( Ireland ) said she welcomed the Director-Generals intention to maintain an ongoing IAEA presence at the plant. Emphasizing that the Agency has a key role in helping Ukraine uphold nuclear safety and security, she expressed concern by the situation at the plant, including the ongoing military activity and shelling. She urged the Russian Federation to stop its efforts to disconnect the plant from the main Ukrainian grid, which creates a significant risk of a catastrophic radiological incident. The Director-General has again clearly laid out the importance of the seven pillars of nuclear safety and security and how these are being flouted at Zaporizhzhia, due to the Russian Federations actions. She called on the Russian Federation and, indeed, all States to fully commit themselves to those seven pillars, for all nuclear facilities and materials, including in situations of armed conflict. \"If Russia is serious about safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, it must end its illegal occupation of the site and withdraw its troops and munitions,\" she said. It is essential so Ukrainian authorities, with the IAEA, can uphold their responsibilities for safety and security at the site.\n\nTRINE SKARBOEVIK HEIMERBACK ( Norway ) said IAEAs continued presence at the Zaporizhzhia plant cannot be overstated. Commending the Ukrainian staff who continue to operate the plant under occupation by Russian forces, she called on the Russian Federation to return full control to its Ukrainian operator. Safety and security conditions at Zaporizhzhia have deteriorated solely because of the Russian Federations aggression, she said, emphasizing that it is totally unacceptable that a nuclear plant has become a frontline in the Russian war against Ukraine. Noting that IAEA identified the urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster, she said this can be achieved through the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. She reaffirmed the importance of the seven IAEA pillars and expressed support for the Agencys efforts to ensure their implementation in Ukraine. She also voiced particular concern over the seizure of the plant as a means of taking hostage an essential source of electricity supply for Ukraine, stressing that the power rightly belongs to the people of Ukraine. Any attempts to disconnected it from the Ukrainian grid are unacceptable. The Russian Federations aggression has aggravated global food insecurity, affecting the most vulnerable the hardest, she added.\n\nRUCHIRA KAMBOJ ( India ), voicing appreciation for the IAEAs recent visit to Ukraine, said her country continues to carefully follow developments regarding the safety and security of Ukraines nuclear power reactors and facilities. The Agencys discharge of its safeguards and monitoring activities, in accordance with its Statute in an effective, non-discriminatory and efficient manner, is of high priority to her delegation. There must be a strict mutual restraint so as not to endanger the safety and security of nuclear facilities and personnel working there. Since the beginning of the conflict, her country has consistently called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and an end to violence. She urged both sides to return to the path of diplomacy and dialogue, voicing support for all diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. She welcomed the Secretary-General-backed initiative to open the exports of grains from Ukraine via the Black Sea and the facilitation of the exports of Russian food and fertilizers, noting that those efforts demonstrate that differences can be resolved through sustained dialogue and diplomacy.\n\nMOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB ( United Arab Emirates ), emphasizing that the IAEAs Mission marked a crucial first step to assessing the safety of Ukraines nuclear facilities, voiced his hope that this spirit of technical cooperation will be extended to all such facilities in Ukraine. Expressing concern that the plants physical integrity has been violated several times, he underscored the need for measures to be put in place to prevent an accident that could arise from the physical damage. The recent news that the plant was disconnected from the grid due to a fire caused by shelling is a \"serious concern\", he stressed, underscoring the critical importance of de-escalation. Disruption of the external power supply could have disastrous consequences. He recalled that nuclear plants are afforded special protection under international humanitarian law; such protections must be upheld. Calling on both sides to ensure the seven IAEA pillars are respected, he expressed alarm that all seven have been compromised. Going forward, the continued presence of IAEA inspectors will remain essential, he said, calling for the cessation of hostilities and a diplomatic end to the conflict.\n\nMICHEL XAVIER BIANG ( Gabon ) voiced concern about reports of several violations to the physical integrity of the nuclear power plant and disruption in electric supply. It is crucial and urgent to restore and preserve the physical integrity of the power station, he stressed, condemning any and all use or threat to use a nuclear facility for military purposes. He called for a cessation of all military activity within or near the nuclear power plant, noting that parties to the conflict must abstain from any attack against the site. He also called for an independent and impartial investigation to establish responsibility for all military activity when it is damaging to nuclear facilities. Parties to the conflict must abide by existing rules of nuclear security and cooperate with IAEA in a transparent manner to ensure that the site is safe. \"We cannot be satisfied by half measures given the scope of the danger,\" he said, stressing that good-faith negotiations must continue in order to put an end to the war. He encouraged all initiatives aimed at bringing parties to the negotiating table to stop the hostilities.\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ) said the safety and security of the Zaporizhzhia plant has been nerve-wracking for the international community. Noting that the Agencys inspectors were able to carry out an objective inspection, he said he was pleased with the positive developments. However, despite repeated warnings, the shelling has continued, even after the inspectors had arrived. \"This is truly worrying,\" he said. Pointing out that the Chernobyl nuclear accident has not faded into memory, he emphasized that the world cannot afford another nuclear disaster. He called on all parties to act rationally and safely and to implement the seven pillars proposed by the Agencys Director-General. He expressed his support for the inspectors long-term presence and said he hoped they can provide technical and safe support. He also encouraged the Agency to maintain its communication with relevant parties. The international community should step up diplomatic efforts to help achieve a ceasefire, with all parties adopting a safe approach to jointly maintain global security.\n\nJUAN RAMN DE LA FUENTE RAMREZ ( Mexico ) said ensuring the smooth security and operation of the Zaporizhzhia plant is essential in order to avoid a disaster. He called for avoiding any action that risks its physical integrity and that of IAEA experts, underscoring Mexicos confidence in their impartiality. He voiced concern that the seven pillars are not being fully respected in the area, cautioning that any attack against a nuclear installation is a violation of international law. He urged the Agency to continue sharing with the Council any relevant information, expressing hope that IAEAs visit and permanent presence at the plant will foster early negotiations to end hostilities in Ukraine. With that, he reiterated Mexicos commitment to do its utmost to promote a diplomatic solution to end the war.\n\nHAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN ( Ghana ) said todays briefing reinforced his continuing concern about the rapidly escalating risk of a radioactive exposure resulting from the militarization of the Zaporizhzhia plant and the surrounding area. After the unrelenting shellfire at the facility on 25 August, which led to a temporary loss of the main power supply to the nuclear reactors, he said he was equally concerned to learn that the plants main connection to the power grid was lost on Saturday due to sustained shelling. These incidents compromise the cooling and safe functioning of the plant and elevate the risks of accidental or deliberate radioactive exposure. He added his full endorsement of the IAEAs position that, pending the conflicts end and the re-establishment of stable conditions, interim measures will be urgently needed to prevent a nuclear accident due to physical damage caused by military action. He also welcomed the permanent presence of the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia at the facility and urged the parties to cooperate fully with the team. It is crucial for the Russian Federation to heed international calls for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its forces from the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine and to pave the way for meaningful engagement between the parties towards a peaceful settlement.\n\nMICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO ( Kenya ) said as State party to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, Kenya upholds the treatys aims: to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology; to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear energy; and to further disarmament. He expressed his deep concern regarding the fragile nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine, particularly at the Zaporizhzhia plant. He welcomed the presence of the IAEA team there and urged full support and cooperation for them. The parties concerned must exercise restraint, act with caution, refrain from any action that may compromise nuclear safety and security, and work to minimize the possibility of accidents. He called for an immediate cessation of the war through diplomatic tools to spare further suffering for the Ukrainian people and he reaffirmed Kenyas respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\n\nNICOLAS DE RIVIRE ( France ), Council President for September, spoke in his national capacity to say that for several weeks, his country has been mobilized at the highest level to facilitate the deployment of IAEA experts to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. President Emmanuel Macron and the Minister for Foreign Affairs received the IAEA Director-General in Paris to express their full support, he reported, also highlighting the constructive role played by the Ukrainian authorities to ensure that the mission takes place in the best possible conditions. Voicing concern about the conclusions shared by IAEA, he said strikes and shelling near and from the plant must cease. In addition, all Russian military personnel and equipment must be removed from the plant immediately, he stressed, calling for the plants demilitarization. Moreover, Ukrainian personnel operating the plant must be able to carry out its mission without threat or pressure. Ukrainian sovereignty over the Zaporizhzhia plant must be respected. The Russian Federation must return full control of the plant to Ukraine, as well as of all nuclear installations in Ukraine, and put an end to its attempts to divert the electricity produced at the plant to its illegally occupied territories.\n\nMr. GROSSI said he valued all the delegates comments, noting that they were a tremendous source of encouragement. Nonetheless, the purpose of the Mission was not only to produce reports, though reports are indispensable, but to get things done and improve the situation. He also said he was glad that the delegates recognized the seven pillars and supported an initiative for interim measures to protect the safety and security of the plant through a protection zone. Thus, as important as what was in the report, what is more important is what will come next, he stressed. In that regard, he said he will soon approach the relevant parties with concrete elements for their consideration to move forward in the next logical step. The first step is the immediate protection to the plant, he noted, adding that he was always at the Councils disposal and will continue to count on the Secretary-Generals support for Agency personnel. He appealed to all to work together on the protection of the Zaporizhzhia plant and to help establish a protection zone.\n\nSERGIY KYSLYTSYA ( Ukraine ), expressing his appreciation for the bravery and professionalism of the IAEA experts, said that their visit is only the first step. The plant remains under occupation; the Russian military equipment and weapons are still deployed at the site; and armed provocations continue. The only way to remove the nuclear threat is the withdrawal of the Russian weaponry and troops and the return of the station to the full legitimate control of Ukraine. This is a key prerequisite for restoring nuclear safety and security and respect for international law. He also said he remained concerned that the Ukrainian staff was working under conditions of threats and pressure by the Russians. The IAEA verified the Ukraine delegations assertions during previous Council meetings that it was the Russian Federations practice to use the plant as a shield for its personnel and hardware. The issue now under discussion, the continuous presence of the IAEA at the plant, was put forward by Ukraine, which is ready for immediate substantive consultations with the IAEA on the modalities of the Agencys continuous presence at the plant to stabilize the critical situation and avoid future aggravation.\n\nHe re-confirmed that under no circumstance has Ukraine ever resorted to forceful military actions in relation to the plant, which endangers Ukraine and millions of lives in neighbouring countries. Yesterday, the last power transmission line that connected the station to Ukraines energy system was damaged, he said, adding: \"This is the second time, due to Russian provocation, that the Zaporizhzhia station was one step away from nuclear disaster.\" He went on to cite President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy, who said yesterday: \"We consider the fact that Russia is doing this right now, right on the eve of the IAEA conclusions, very eloquent.\" He further cited the Presidents remarks, adding that the Russian Federation only wants the situation to remain the worst for the longest time. Only by strengthening sanctions and only by officially recognizing Russia as a terrorist state, at all levels, will the situation be corrected.\n\nThe main outcome of the joint international efforts must be the withdrawal of the Russian military and civilian personnel from the plants territory, as well as from Enerhodar, he continued. This will definitely bring the plant to its safe and secure operation, as it was before the Russian Federations war against Ukraine. As stated in the IAEA report, \"the current situation is untenable and the best action to ensure the safety and security of Ukraines nuclear facilities and its people would be for the armed conflict to end now,\" he said.",

The mission comprised IAEA nuclear safety, security, and safeguards staff. (Photo credit: D. Candano Laris/IAEA)\n\nOn Thursday, experts of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UNs nuclear watchdog, reached the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine for what is the riskiest mission of the agencys history. Shortly before departing for the plant from Kyiv, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told journalists: \"We are aware of the current situation. There has been increased military activity, including a few minutes ago. But weighing the pros and cons, and having come so far, we are not stopping.\" Wearing a blue bulletproof vest stamped \"United Nations,\" Grossi added: \"We are moving now, accepting the risks are very, very high,\" commenting ahead of their trip across the front line.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, was seized by Russian forces in March and has since then raised fears of a nuclear accident due to a power outage, human error, or military mistake. On August 25, the plant was temporarily disconnected from the power grid after fires caused by shelling cut the last power line connecting the plant to Ukraines grid system. The incident forced the automatic shutdown of reactors 5 and 6 and triggered the emergency diesel generators to maintain the cooling of the reactor core and spent fuel pools and prevent a nuclear accident. It was the first time in nearly 40 years of operation that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from the grid.\n\nOn Thursday morningonly hours before IAEA experts headed to Zaporizhzhiathe plant was forced again to trigger emergency systems, shutting down reactor 5 after shelling struck a 330-kV backup power line.\n\nThe mission comes after a month-long of intense negotiations and pressure by the international community to have Russia and Ukraine let an IAEA mission inspect the plants physical integrity, staff conditions, and safety and security systems. Earlier this August, a Russian diplomat said that it was too dangerous for an IAEA mission to pass through the capital city of Kyiv. But on August 23, the UNs Security Council announced that it had gathered the necessary logistics and security capabilities to support an IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia plant from Kyiv, provided Russia and Ukraine agree. On Monday, Grossi announced that he would lead such a mission.\n\nOfficially called IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ), the effort consists of a 14-member team of nuclear safety, security, and safeguards staff, including IAEAs chief. \"We have a very important mission to accomplish,\" Grossi said on Thursday. It was not clear however what the experts would be looking at during their mission. Earlier on that day, Grossi commented that he and his team of experts will work on \"a detailed analysis of some of the more technical aspects,\" without specifying what those aspects were.\n\nAnother doubt concerned the extent of the IAEAs mission. Russia reportedly has been hiding heavy military equipment at the plants premises. It was not clear whether experts would be allowed to inspect all buildings. In photos of the visit released by the IAEA, Grossi and the other mission members are seen taking notes as they tour the facility and talking to employees of Energoatom, Ukraines state nuclear company. There was no sign of Russian troops or military equipment. In one picture, IAEA staff are seen next to what is believed to be an emergency diesel generator, like those triggered on the same day.\n\nAfter his visit, Grossi said: \"It is obvious the physical integrity of the plant has been violated, several times. This is a reality that cannot continue to happen.\" But it is not clear how the IAEA can help reduce the risk of a nuclear accident. The agency has no authority to order a cease-fire or create a demilitarized zone.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Grossi tweeted, as he was completing his first visit, that the IAEA will stay and establish a permanent presence at the plant. \"We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving,\" Grossi said after he returned to Ukrainian-held territory.",

He hoped he might consult \"very quickly\" and \"establish an interim measure\" because \"what we need desperately is to protect this nuclear plant because it is being shelled.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Now the IAEA has been there, we have corroborated what is happening. And this is a measure that one way or the other must be put in place. We can do it. We have the means to do it Nuclear security is indispensable. We are playing with fire.\"\n\nDamage caused by shelling to the elevated passage of Unit 6. IAEA\n\nHours earlier, the IAEA called for the \"immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone\" around the nuclear power plant, in a report published Tuesday.\n\n\"There is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,\" the IAEA wrote in its report.\n\n\"This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone,\" the agency goes on to say in the report, adding that it was ready to start consultations for \"the urgent establishment of such a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the ZNPP.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated report comes days after Grossi led an expert mission to Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear complex of its kind in Europe, in what was the first independent look at the condition of the facility since Russia seized it at the start of the war.\n\nThe plant and the area around it, including the nearby city of Enerhodar, have endured persistent shelling that has raised fears of a nuclear accident through the interruption of the power supply to the plant. Each side accuses the other of acts of nuclear terrorism.\n\nTwo members of the 14-person team remained behind as part of the agencys plan to establish a continuous presence at the nuclear plant that could help stave off the possibility of a dangerous nuclear accident.\n\nWhile there, the team saw first-hand the damage shelling has caused to the facility and \"noted with concern that the shelling could have impacted safety related structures, systems and components, and could have caused safety significant impacts, loss of lives and personnel injuries,\" the report said.\n\nThe team saw damage \"at different locations caused by reported events with some of the damage being close to the reactor buildings,\" it wrote.\n\nThis included damage to the roofs of various buildings, to the special building that houses fresh nuclear fuel and solid radioactive waste storage facility, and \"the container where the radiation monitoring system is located, in the vicinity of the dry spent fuel storage facility.\"\n\nThe IAEA team observes the damage caused by shelling on the roof of a building at Zaporizhzhia. IAEA\n\nThe IAEA team also witnessed shelling during its visit and called on both sides to cease hostilities in the area, it wrote. In one incident, the team had to evacuate to the ground level of the plants administrative building.\n\n\"While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance,\" the report concluded.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russia has accused Ukraine of firing at the plant, while Kyiv alleges that Moscow is using it as a fortress to protect its forces and heavy weaponry from Ukrainian forces, which have purportedly been ordered not to fire back at the sprawling complex. CNN has been unable to verify either governments claims.\n\nThe IAEA team noted \"the presence of Russian military personnel, vehicles and equipment at various places\" of the plant, adding that \"military vehicles stationed under the overpass connecting the reactor units.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated report comes days after IAEA's Director General Rafael Grossi led an expert mission to Zaporizhzhia. D. Candano Laris/IAEA/Reuters\n\nThe plants staff have been working under inordinate pressure, and Grossi said it \"was essential that the Ukrainian staff operating the plant under Russian occupation must be able to carry out their important duties without threats or pressure undermining not only their own safety but also that of the facility itself,\" the report wrote.\n\n\"The IAEA recommends that shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities, for the safety of the operating staff and to maintain the physical integrity to support safe and secure operation,\" it added.\n\nThe IAEA goes on to say the situation in Ukraine \"is unprecedented,\" and that a \"nuclear accident can have serious impacts within the country and beyond its borders.\"\n\n\"The current situation is untenable and the best action to ensure the safety and security of Ukraines nuclear facilities and its people would be for this armed conflict to end now,\" the report reads.\n\n\"The seven pillars have all been compromised at the site,\" the report said in reference to the nuclear watchdogs framework, which includes the physical integrity of facilities, their safety systems, secure off-site power supply, effective radiation monitoring systems and reliable communications with the regulator.\n\nUkrainian officials on Monday said Russian shelling led its last operating reactor to disconnect from Ukraines grid, and President Volodymyr Zelensky later accused Russia of intentionally deteriorating the situation around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.\n\n\"Russia is only interested in keeping the situation at its worst for the longest time,\" he said in his nightly address on Monday.\n\nWhile the international community has been on high alert about nuclear safety, experts believe a Chernobyl-style disaster is unlikely. The plant is equipped with modern security systems, meaning even if there was neglect to its upkeep, or major military action caused serious damage, the result would be most comparable to the nuclear disaster in Fukushima which was contained locally, according to Janes and Energoatom.",

Some members of the inspection team left after spending several hours there. Ukraine's nuclear power operator Energoatom said five team members would stay on for two more days.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have accused each other of trying to sabotage the IAEA mission to the plant, which sits on the south bank of a huge reservoir on the Dnipro River that divides Russian and Ukrainian forces in central southern Ukraine. Since the early days of the conflict, the plant has been controlled by Russian troops but operated by Ukrainian staff.\n\nConditions at the plant have been unravelling for weeks, with Moscow and Kyiv regularly trading blame for shelling in the vicinity, fuelling fears of a Chornobyl-style radiation disaster.\n\nKyiv also accuses Moscow of using the Russian-controlled plant as a shield for its weapons, which Russia denies, and of planning to switch it from Ukraine's power grid to Russia's, effectively stealing its output.\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was doing everything to ensure that the plant could operate safely, and for the IAEA inspectors to be able to complete their tasks.\n\n\"In the event of further attempts by Kyiv to disrupt their work with shelling or sabotage, the entire responsibility for the consequences will fall entirely on the Zelenskiy regime and its handlers and their 'support group' in the West,\" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement, referring to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nEarlier, Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said Russian shelling had forced the shutdown of one of the two reactors still operating at the site, while Moscow said it had thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to seize the plant. read more\n\nA Reuters reporter in the nearby Russian-controlled town of Enerhodar said a residential building was struck by shelling, forcing people to take cover in a basement.

Ammar Awad/Reuters\n\nRussian shelling killed four Ukrainian civilians in Donetsk Province over the weekend, offering a grim reminder of the continuous battle in the countrys east even as the wars focus has shifted to the south.\n\nThe governor for Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Sunday that two people had been killed a day earlier in the village of Velyka Novosilka, which is about 60 miles west of the regional capital. Shelling also killed one person in the city of Siversk, which is north of Donetsk, and another in the village of Vodiane, Mr. Kyrylenko said. Two people were wounded.\n\nMr. Kyrylenko added in a post on the Telegram messaging app that 797 civilians have died and more than 20,000 have been wounded in the Donetsk region since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.\n\nBut Ukraines new attempt to regain ground in the southern province of Kherson, which was lost to Moscow at the start of the war, has shifted the dynamics in the east.\n\nAfter failing to capture Ukraines capital early in the war, Russian forces switched focus to try to seize control of the eastern Donbas region, which is made up of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces. They had captured nearly all of Luhansk by early July of this year, but their efforts since to take control of neighboring Donetsk have stalled.\n\nThat is in part because of a weekslong pause by Moscow in its offensive to rotate and refresh troops, but also because Ukraine has been preparing defensive positions in Donetsk since 2014 when rebels loyal to Russia seized government buildings there and in Luhansk, beginning a long trench war with Ukrainian forces that are difficult to dislodge. Ukrainian attacks on Russian ammunition depots and other supply points behind the front lines, using longer-range artillery supplied by Western countries, have also slowed Russias advances in Donetsk.\n\nNow, an uptick in fighting in Kherson has changed the calculus for both sides in Donetsk.\n\n\"As Ukraine tries to make advances in Kherson and the Russian military fights and tries to defend that territory, the rest of the Russian forces attempt to make incremental advances on Donbas,\" Michael Kofman, director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for a New American Security, said on the War on the Rocks podcast.\n\nThere are signs that Moscow might reinforce its troops in the east to renew its stalled campaign. Ukrainian military intelligence has said in recent days that the Russian armys newest grouping the 3rd Army Corps will likely be deployed to Donbas.\n\nIt would be the first major new formation of troops to be dispatched by the Kremlin since it launched a campaign in July to bring in new recruits though military analysts have questioned the groupings combat readiness.\n\n\"Images of the 3rd Army Corps elements have shown the volunteers to be physically unfit and old,\" a recent analysis by the Institute for the Study of War said.\n\nAnalysts say that fighting in eastern Ukraine will almost certainly stretch into next year. A likely hiatus in offensive operations in the winter will give both sides an opportunity to train new forces, and so it will be critical for Ukraine to force Russia to commit new troops just to hold its current positions, the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank that specializes in security issues, said in a report.\n\nThe United States government estimated in July that 15,000 Russians had been killed since February and said that Ukraine had also suffered significant losses. On Sunday, Britains ministry of defense said in an intelligence update that Russian troops were continuing to suffer from low morale.\n\n\"With the prospect of a bitter winter spent outdoors, there is ample opportunity to ensure that Russias forces remain cold, wet, hungry, miserable and therefore vulnerable to shock and a collapse in morale,\" the report said.",

Soldiers ran about and helicopters flew overhead.\n\nRussias Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was doing everything to ensure that the plant could operate safely, and for the IAEA inspectors to be able to complete their tasks.\n\nConditions at the nuclear plant, Europes largest, have been unravelling for weeks, with Moscow and Kyiv regularly trading blame for shelling in the vicinity and fuelling fears of a Chornobyl-style radiation disaster.\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Grossi told reporters early on Thursday in the city of Zaporizhzhia, 55 km from the plant, he was aware of \"increased military activity in the area\" but would press ahead with the plan to visit the facility and meet staff.\n\n\"Having come so far, we are not stopping,\" said Grossi, who is heading the mission.\n\nThe IAEA inspectors, wearing body armour and travelling in white, armoured land cruisers with UN markings on their sides, drove out of the city escorted by the police and were held at the first check point outside the city.\n\nProvocation\n\nOleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia region, said Russian troops had shelled the route of the IAEA mission planned to use to reach the power station.\n\nRussia accused Ukrainian forces of trying to seize the plant and also of shelling both the meeting point of the IAEA delegation and the nuclear plant itself.\n\nRussias defence ministry said up to 60 Ukrainian troops had crossed the Dnipro river, which divides territory held by the two sides, in boats at 6:00 a.m. local time (0300 GMT), in what it said was a \"provocation\" aimed at disrupting the IAEA visit.\n\nThe ministry said that \"measures had been taken\" to destroy the opposing troops, including use of military aviation.\n\nSeparately, a local Russian-installed official, Vladimir Rogov, told state broadcaster RT that Ukrainian forces launched an attack out of \"desperation\" over the IAEA visit. He later said \"around 40\" of the 60 Ukrainian troops had been killed.\n\nUkrainian officials have welcomed the IAEA visit, expressing hope that it will lead to the demilitarisation of the plant. They say Russia has been using the plant as a shield to hit towns, knowing it will be hard for Kyivs forces to return fire.\n\nThey have also accused Russian forces of shelling the plant, which Russian officials deny.\n\nRussian state news agency TASS said residential areas in the town of Enerhodar home to the Zaporizhzhia plant had come under \"massive\" shelling from Ukrainian troops overnight, citing Russian-appointed authorities.\n\nReuters journalists who followed the IAEA convoy before being ordered to turn back due to the dangerous conditions said that while they were in the city of Zaporizhzhia during the night, they had seen flashes of explosions in the sky.\n\nThey could not verify who was responsible.\n\nRussia accuses Ukrainians of targeting the plant to try to generate outrage in hopes it will result in a demilitarized zone.\n\nGrossi said such a status was a political matter for the countries in conflict to decide. He said on Wednesday the IAEA mission aimed \"to prevent a nuclear accident\".\n\nRussian-installed officials have suggested that the team from the U.N. nuclear watchdog would have only a day to inspect the plant, while the mission is preparing for longer.\n\n\"If we are able to establish a permanent presence, or a continued presence, then its going to be prolonged. But this first segment is going to take a few days,\" Grossi said.\n\nSlow process\n\nBoth sides have claimed battlefield successes amid a new Ukrainian push to recapture territory in the south.\n\n\"It is a very slow process, because we value people,\" said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, referring to the Ukrainian offensive.\n\nMoscow has denied reports of Ukrainian progress and said its troops had routed Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia captured large tracts of southern Ukraine close to the Black Sea coast in the early weeks of the over six-month-old war, including in the Kherson region, north of the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula.\n\nElsewhere, Ukraine repelled Russian attacks in the direction of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, towns north of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, its armed forces general staff said.\n\nPro-Russian troops have focused on Bakhmut in their push to extend control over the Donbas region, Ukraines industrial heartland in its east, the general staff added on Wednesday.\n\nRussian-backed separatists said on Thursday that 13 emergency service personnel were killed and nine wounded after coming under Ukrainian artillery fire in the Russian-controlled part of Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nReuters was not able to independently verify the report.\n\nRussia sent its troops over the border on 24 February for what it calls a \"special military operation\" to rid Ukraine of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities.\n\nUkraine and the West describe Russias actions as an unprovoked war of aggression that has caused millions to flee, killed thousands and turned cities into rubble.\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

No one was hurt and coast guards were attending, it said.\n\nEarlier this week the Joint Coordination Center, run by the United Nations, Ukraine, Russia and Turkey after a grains-export deal was reached, said the Lady Zehma was cleared to depart Ukraine's Chornomorsk port for Ravenna, Italy.\n\n7:42 p.m.: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned Moldova on Thursday that threatening the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transdniestria risked triggering military confrontation with Moscow.\n\nRussia has stationed peacekeeping troops in Transdniestria since the early 1990s, when an armed conflict saw pro-Russian separatists wrest most of the region from Moldovan control.\n\nThe government in Chisinau, stressing it was committed to peaceful dialog over the future of the region, said it would summon the acting Russian ambassador to make clear its position.\n\nRussia says its army is there to maintain peace and stability, but Moldova wants Moscow to withdraw its forces.\n\n6:40 p.m.: Two advisers to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have asked French oil major TotalEnergies to reject a $438.02 million dividend from one of its Russian holdings or to spend the money on Ukrainian reconstruction.\n\nIn a Sept. 1 letter, Zelenskyy advisers Oleg Ustenko and Mykhailo Podolyak asked CEO Patrick Pouyanne if TotalEnergies was planning to reject the dividend and - if not - called on the firm to establish a fund for Ukrainian war victims. The letter was seen by Reuters and first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTotalEnergies did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\n5:35 p.m.: The visit by U.N. experts to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will be successful if it leads to the demilitarization of the facility, the head of Ukraine's state nuclear company said on Thursday.\n\nEnergoatom chief Petro Kotin, speaking to Reuters at a Ukrainian-controlled checkpoint on the road to the plant, said Ukrainian authorities were working to turn the plant's fifth reactor back on after it shut down because of shelling early Thursday.\n\n4:46 p.m.: The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross called on Thursday for all fighting near the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia power plant to stop, warning that little could be done to respond in the event of a major accident there.\n\n\"In the event of a nuclear leak, it will be difficult if not impossible to provide humanitarian assistance ... and this is why fighting should stop,\" Robert Mardini told a news conference during a visit to Ukraine.\n\nMardini told Reuters that the Red Cross was not stockpiling or distributing iodine tablets to people near the plant to avoid sowing panic.\n\n\"We don't want to give a signal that this is inevitable,\" he said. \"This is totally self-inflicted risk that should be totally stopped.\"\n\n3:45 p.m.:\n\n2:45 p.m.: Russia is calling for a United Nations Security Council meeting next week to discuss the situation regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, VOAs U.N.

The other is jailing critics, muzzling journalists, pushing his country deeper into isolation and waging Europes bloodiest conflict since World War II, The Associated Press reported Thursday.\n\nSuch are historys bookends between Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Unions last leader, and Vladimir Putin, Russias president.\n\nIn many ways, Gorbachev, who died Tuesday, unwittingly enabled Putin. The forces Gorbachev unleashed spun out of control, led to his downfall and the Soviet Unions collapse.\n\nSince coming to power in 1999, Putin has been taking a hard line that resulted in a near-complete reversal of Gorbachevs reforms.\n\n1:10 p.m.: Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, was shocked and bewildered by the Ukraine conflict in the months before he died and psychologically crushed in recent years by Moscow's worsening ties with Kyiv, his interpreter said on Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nPavel Palazhchenko, who worked with the late Soviet president for 37 years and was at his side at numerous U.S.-Soviet summits, spoke to Gorbachev a few weeks ago by phone and said he and others had been struck by how traumatized he was by events in Ukraine.\n\n\"It's not just the (special military) operation that started on February 24, but the entire evolution of relations between Russia and Ukraine over the past years that was really, really a big blow to him. It really crushed him emotionally and psychologically,\" Palazhchenko told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\"It was very obvious to us in our conversations with him that he was shocked and bewildered by what was happening (after Russian troops entered Ukraine in February) for all kinds of reasons. He believed not just in the closeness of the Russian and Ukrainian people, he believed that those two nations were intermingled.\"\n\nNow 73, he is well placed to know the late politician's state of mind in the period before he died, having seen him in recent months and been in touch with Gorbachev's daughter Irina. Gorbachev, who was 91 when he died on Tuesday from an unspecified illness, had family connections to Ukraine, said Palazhchenko.\n\n12:45 p.m.:\n\n12:05 p.m.: International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi has left the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom wrote on Telegram on Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nEnergoatom wrote that five IAEA representatives will remain on the plant's territory, likely until September 3.\n\n11:15 a.m.: As the war in Ukraine stretches into its seventh month, North Korea is hinting at its interest in sending construction workers to help rebuild Russian-occupied territories in the countrys east, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe idea is openly endorsed by senior Russian officials and diplomats, who foresee a cheap and hard-working workforce that could be thrown into the \"most arduous conditions,\" a term Russias ambassador to North Korea used in a recent interview.\n\nNorth Koreas ambassador to Moscow recently met with envoys from two Russia-backed separatist territories in the Donbas region of Ukraine and expressed optimism about cooperation in the \"field of labor migration,\" citing his countrys easing pandemic border controls.\n\nThe talks came after North Korea in July became the only nation aside from Russia and Syria to recognize the independence of the territories, Donetsk and Luhansk, further aligning with Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n10:25 a.m.:\n\n9:50 a.m.: Russia on Thursday launched weeklong war games involving forces from China and other nations in a show of growing defense cooperation between Moscow and Beijing, as they both face tensions with the United States, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe maneuvers are also intended to demonstrate that Moscow has sufficient military might for massive drills even as its troops are engaged in military action in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that the Vostok 2022 (East 2022) exercise will be held until Sept. 7 at seven firing ranges in Russias Far East and the Sea of Japan and involve more than 50,000 troops and over 5,000 weapons units, including 140 aircraft and 60 warships.\n\nRussian General Staff chief, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, will personally oversee the drills involving troops from several ex-Soviet nations, China, India, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Syria.\n\nThe Defense Ministry noted that as part of the maneuvers, the Russian and Chinese navies in the Sea of Japan will \"practice joint action to protect sea communications, areas of marine economic activity and support for ground troops in littoral areas.\"\n\n9:15 a.m.: A team of U.N. experts arrived at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia atomic plant complex on Thursday to assess the risk of a radiation disaster after being delayed several hours by shelling near the site, Reuters reported.\n\nA Reuters reporter saw the IAEA team arrive in a large convoy with a heavy presence of Russian soldiers nearby. A Ukrainian source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters the mission \"may turn out to be shorter than was planned.\"\n\nRussia and Ukraine accused each other of trying to sabotage the mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the plant in southern central Ukraine, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff.\n\nConditions at the nuclear plant, Europe's largest, have been unravelling for weeks, with Moscow and Kyiv regularly trading blame for shelling in the vicinity and fueling fears of a Chornobyl-style radiation disaster.\n\n8:00 a.m.: The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency reported on Twitter Thursday morning that its inspection team, led by Director General Rafael Grossi, had reached the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power facility, after many delays.\n\n7:40 a.m.: The IAEA's monitoring mission to the under-fire Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant may turn out to be \"shorter than planned,\" a Ukrainian source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Thursday.\n\n\"The mission may turn out to be shorter than was planned,\" the source said on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe IAEA convoy's progress to the plant was delayed on Thursday by fresh shelling on its territory, with Kyiv and Moscow accusing each other of being responsible.\n\n7:15 a.m.: Robert Mardini, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, has warned that fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant must be halted immediately before a \"massive incident\" causes a humanitarian catastrophe, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\n\"In the event of a nuclear leak, it will be difficult if not impossible to provide humanitarian assistance...and this is why fighting should stop,\" Mardini told a news conference on September 1 during a visit to Ukraine.\n\n\"It is therefore time to stop playing with fire and instead take concrete measures to protect this facility, and others like it, from military any operations.... The slightest miscalculation could trigger devastation that we will regret for decades,\" he added.\n\nExperts from the International Atomic Energy Agency were on their way to visit the plant early on September 1 despite ongoing shelling. The mission is set to assess physical damage to the plant, determine the functionality of safety and security systems, evaluate staff conditions and perform urgent safeguards activities.\n\n\"The scenario could be a massive incident, and...there is very little anyone can do to mitigate the dire consequences of this,\" Mardini said.\n\n6:40 a.m.: The Kremlin said on Thursday it was concerned about a possible \"provocation\" from Ukraine at the Russian-held Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant ahead of a visit by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Reuters reported.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have accused each other of trying to sabotage the mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the plant in southern Ukraine, which was delayed on Thursday due to shelling near the facility.\n\n\"We are concerned about a provocation from the Ukrainian side, given that barbaric and provocative shelling has not stopped,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. Peskov said Russia was ready to cooperate with the IAEA and was interested in seeing the IAEA mission arrive at the plant.\n\nA spokesperson for the IAEA said that its mission was waiting at a Ukrainian checkpoint after fresh shelling but remained determined to reach the facility later in the day.\n\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier on Thursday that Russia was doing everything to ensure that the plant, controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff, was operating safely.\n\n6:10 a.m.: The company that oversees Ukraines nuclear power plants said shelling by Russian forces triggered a shutdown at one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant, The Associated Press reported, underscoring the risks faced by a team of U.N. inspectors that was heading there Thursday to assess its safety.\n\nUkraines Enerhoatom said Russian mortar shelling led to the shutdown of one of its reactors by its emergency protection system. Shelling also damaged a backup power supply line used for in-house needs, and one of the plants reactors that wasnt operating was switched to diesel generators, the company said.\n\nA team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, led by its director Rafael Grossi, set off for the Russia-held nuclear power plant Europes largest despite the heavy shelling for which Ukraine and Russia trade blame.\n\n\"There has been increased military activity, including this morning until very recently,\" Grossi said, adding that after being briefed by the Ukrainian military he decided to get moving despite the inherent risks. \"But weighing the pros and cons and having come so far, we are not stopping.\"\n\nA spokesman for the IAEA later said that the mission has been delayed on the Ukrainian-controlled side of the frontline for some three hours, adding that Grossi \"has personally negotiated with Ukrainian military authorities to be able to proceed and he remains determined that this important mission reaches the ZNPP today.\"\n\n5:22 a.m.: The U.K. defense ministry, in its latest intelligence update, said Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations in southern Ukraine, supported by intensive long-range strikes against Russian command and logistics locations across the occupied zone.\n\n4:34 a.m.: The Russian economy shrank 0.4% in the first six months of 2022 compared with a year ago, but capital investment, one of the main economic growth drivers, rose 7.8%, data from the federal statistics service Rosstat showed on Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe export-dependent economy is plunging into recession, hit by sweeping Western sanctions for what Moscow calls \"a special military operation\" in Ukraine. But the depth of contraction has so far been not as big as initially thought.\n\nIn 2022, the economy will shrink by less than 3%, a top government official said this week in contrast to the earlier assumption from the economy ministry that had warned of a drop of more than 12%.\n\nRosstat data contradicts expectations of many economists who had predicted the Russian economy would collapse this year under the weight of unprecedented Western sanctions. But higher prices for its oil exports cushioning the impact.\n\n3:31 a.m.: Germany's chief of defense has warned that the West must not underestimate Moscow's military strength, saying Russia has the scope to open up a second front should it choose to do so.\n\n\"The bulk of the Russian land forces may be tied down in Ukraine at the moment but, even so, we should not underestimate the Russian land forces' potential to open a second theatre of war,\" General Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier of the Bundeswehr, told Reuters in an interview.\n\nBeyond the army, Russia also has a navy and air force at its disposal, he added.\n\n\"Most of the Russian navy has not yet been deployed in the war on Ukraine, and the Russian air force still has significant potential as well, which poses a threat to NATO too,\" Zorn said.\n\n2:37 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, issued its latest assessment of the Ukraine conflict, saying that Russian occupation authorities are imposing a curriculum on Ukrainian students aimed at eliminating the notion of Ukrainian national identity, explicitly in line with Russian President Vladimir Putins speeches and writings falsely claiming that Ukraine is part of Russia, and that the Ukrainian identity was an invention of the Soviet period.\n\nRussian forces, the assessment said, conducted a limited ground attack north of Kharkiv City and ground attacks south of Bakhmut and along the western outskirts of Donetsk City.\n\nUkrainian partisans, the assessment said, conducted an improvised explosive device (IED) attack against the headquarters of the \"Together with Russia\" political organization in Berdyansk, Zaporizhia Oblast, where occupation authorities were reportedly preparing for sham referenda.\n\n1:25 a.m.:\n\n12:02 a.m.: Belgium announced measures to tackle soaring energy prices, including cuts to public buildings' power consumption and a proposal to tax the excess profits of energy companies, Reuters reported.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said on Wednesday the heating in public buildings will be limited to 19 degrees Celsius and air conditioning use reduced, while lighting of offices and monuments will be switched off at 7 p.m. Talks will continue to decide on turning off lights on highways and in cities at certain hours.\n\nThe federal government also decided to extend a reduced 6% VAT rate for gas and electricity and a special energy rate for the poor until the end of the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIt also said it would present by the end of September a proposal to tax the excess profits of energy companies.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) Russia resumed shelling in the vicinity of Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a local official said Wednesday, a day after the U.N. atomic watchdog agency pressed for the warring sides to carve out a safe zone there to protect against a possible catastrophe.\n\nWATCH: IAEA calls for demilitarized zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine\n\nThe city of Nikopol, located on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Europes largest nuclear power plant, was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery, regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said.\n\nThe reports of nearby shelling, which couldnt be independently verified, have caused international alarm. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, warned the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that \"something very, very catastrophic could take place\" at Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"There are fires, blackouts and other things at the (plant) that force us to prepare the local population for the consequences of the nuclear danger,\" Reznichenko said.\n\nThe potential peril led the U.N. atomic watchdog agency to urge Russia and Ukraine to establish a \"nuclear safety and security protection zone\" around the plant.\n\nThere are fears the fighting could trigger a catastrophe on the scale of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. The plant was built during the Soviet era and is one of the 10 biggest in the world.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kiev officials would immediately commit to the idea of a safety zone, saying more details of the proposal were needed.\n\nThe plant is currently generating electricity only to power its safety systems, a senior Ukrainian official said.\n\nAny further disruption could force the plant to use a back-up diesel generator, but that would entail bringing four diesel transport trucks a day through the fighting, said Oleh Korikov, acting Chief State Inspector for the Nuclear and Radiation Safety of Ukraine.\n\n\"We could potentially be in a situation where we run out of diesel,\" he said. \"And this can lead to an accident with damage to the active zone of the reactors, and, accordingly, the release of radioactive products into the environment.\"\n\nAuthorities could consider shutting down the plant, he said, without offering details about how that would work.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin defied pressure to halt the war, saying Wednesday that Moscow will forge ahead with its military offensive in Ukraine until it achieves its goals. He also mocked Western attempts to stop Russia with sanctions.\n\nWATCH: Swedens idyllic holiday island of Gotland militarizes in face of Russian threats\n\nThe eastern city of Sloviansk came under Russian fire on Wednesday morning, damaging a school and another building, according to the head of the city administration Vadym Lyakh.\n\nFirefighters in the city dug deep into the still-smoldering rubble of an apartment building and removed at least one body bag.\n\nChunks of bricks, masonry and concrete lay among the torn branches of nearby trees, mixed with broken glass and roof tiles. Metal doors, buckled by the force of the blast, hung off their hinges.\n\nThe strike came at around 4 a.m., said local resident Raisa Smelkova, 75, who lives in another part of the building. She and her husband were unhurt.\n\nSmelkova and her husband lived through the previous war in Ukraine in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea region. But this time, she said, things are much worse.\n\n\"What is happening now is not just scary, its gruesome,\" she said. \"There is more destruction. Everything is worse. Just everything.\"\n\nThree civilians were killed in Russian shelling in the Donetsk region, the Ukrainian presidential office said. Kharkiv city was hit by rockets twice during the night.\n\nBut Ukrainian forces have taken control of an unspecified number of towns in the Kherson region, according to Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for the southern military command. She said details would come later from the military leadership.\n\nThe U.K. defense ministry said there had been heavy fighting on three fronts: in the north, near Kharkiv; in the east in the Donbas; and in the south in Kherson Oblast.\n\nAmid a Ukrainian counterattack in the east, \"multiple concurrent threats spread across 500 kilometers (310 miles) will test Russias ability to coordinate operational design and reallocate resources across multiple groupings of forces,\" the ministry said Wednesday.\n\nThe Russian military held large-scale military drills that began last week and ended Wednesday in the countrys east that involved forces from China. It was seen as another show of increasingly close ties between Moscow and Beijing amid tensions with the West over the military action in Ukraine.\n\nElena Becatoros in Sloviansk contributed to this report.",

                "cc_text": "The General Assembly today commemorated the International Day against Nuclear Tests, with speakers underscoring the urgent need for universal adherence and entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\n\nAbdulla Shahid (Maldives), President of the General Assembly, recalled that the International Day is observed on 29 August to commemorate the closing of Semipalatinsk, a nuclear test site in Kazakhstan, in 1991, and honour all those who lost their lives to nuclear tests. \"Twenty-five years after adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, we must redouble efforts to promote its universalization and implementation,\" he stressed, highlighting that the ongoing military confrontation in Ukraine has exacerbated the threat of a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nIzumi Nakamitsu, High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, said that, although the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was unable to reach consensus on an outcome document, States parties were united in their overwhelming support for a global ban on nuclear testing. Moreover, progress had been made on victim assistance, a focus that had grown out of the International Day against Nuclear Weapons and one that adds a human security dimension to the national and collective security perspectives. She voiced hope that the remaining Annex II States whose ratification is required for its entry into force will sign and ratify the Test-Ban Treaty and provide impetus for the rest of the non-Annex II States to join it.\n\nRobert Floyd, Executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, also highlighting delegations sincere and tireless efforts, said that four weeks of intense negotiations have laid the groundwork for real progress in the future. Noting that Dominica, Gambia, Timor-Leste and Tuvalu ratified the Test-Ban Treaty this year, he said: \"With Dominicas ratification, we have completed adherence to the CTBT in the Latin American and Caribbean region. With TimorLestes ratification, we have complete adherence in South-East Asia.\"\n\nVivian Okeke, Representative of the Director General to the United Nations and Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Liaison Office, New York, said that, for the past six decades, IAEA has helped to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, while making nuclear science and technology available for peaceful purposes, especially to developing countries. The Agencys recent mission to Zaporizhzhia has now set up a presence at the plant, she said, noting that IAEA has called for the urgent establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the plant.\n\nBenetick Kabua Maddison, Director of the Marshallese Educational Initiative, said that, due to the United States nuclear testing and forced relocation, Marshallese have some of highest rates of cancer and diabetes in the world. \"What we need most today is not only allies but actors,\" he said, calling on Government leaders to recognize the dangers of nuclear weapons production and use, take responsibility for the damage such testing has inflicted and then eliminate such weapons.\n\nMany delegations, united in their support for the Test-Ban Treaty, called on the remaining eight Annex II States to ratify it. Speakers also urged all States to abide by the moratorium on nuclear weapon test explosions and to refrain from any action that runs counter to the Treaty, pending its entry into force.\n\nThe representative of Mauritius, speaking for the African Group, voiced concern about nuclear-weapon States slow pace in eliminating their nuclear arsenals. Pointing to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of those weapons on health, the environment and other resources, he noted that the two failed Review Conferences plunges the Non-Proliferation Treaty into \"uncharted waters\", threatening its credibility.\n\nThe representative of Papua New Guinea, speaking for the Pacific Islands Forum, spotlighted the unresolved nuclear testing legacy issues in his region that continue to pose a danger to the livelihoods of the peoples there. He called on those responsible to address those issues, warning that the climate emergency and growing frequency of natural disasters across the globe has increased the risk of large-scale nuclear accidents.\n\nThailands delegate, speaking for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), pointed to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas intercontinental ballisticmissile launch as such a threat in his region. He reaffirmed his blocs position against nuclear tests, stressing that diplomatic efforts should remain the goal.\n\nTunisias representative, speaking for the Arab Group, reported that the Arab States have joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Yet, Israel violates all norms and rules set by that Treaty. He called for ridding the region of all weapons of mass destruction and urged all parties to negotiate a legally binding convention that promotes international and regional peace and security.\n\nThe representative of Argentina, speaking for the Community of Latin America and Caribbean States (CELAC), spotlighted her regions commitment to the universalization of the Comprehensive TestBan Treaty, noting that all States in the region have signed the instrument. Voicing concern over the rise, modernization, use and threat thereof of nuclear weapons, she underscored that use of those weapons would constitute a crime against humanity.\n\nThe representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, highlighted the Comprehensive TestBan Treaty Organizations verification regime. \"The CTBTO has provided the world with a truly global, high-tech monitoring system for nuclear explosions something that no single country could do,\" he pointed out. To strengthen the verification regime and build capacity in developing countries, the European Union, since 2006, has provided the organization with voluntary contributions of more than 29.5 million.\n\nThe General Assembly also resumed consideration of the topic \"International Cooperation for Access to Justice, Remedies and Assistance for Survivors of Sexual Violence\", with various delegations speaking in explanation of vote after adoption of the resolution, which took place on 2 September. (For background, see Press Release GA/12438.)\n\nAlso speaking on the International Day against Nuclear Tests were the representatives of Kazakhstan, Austria, Ecuador, Hungary, Colombia, China, Italy, Japan, Cote dIvoire, Iran, Brazil, Sri Lanka, United States and Kiribati.\n\nSpeaking in explanation of vote were the representatives of Guatemala, India, Syria, Belarus, Pakistan, Sudan, Egypt, Algeria, Brazil, Libya, Mauritania, Nigeria, Malaysia, Ethiopia and Japan.\n\nThe representatives of the Russian Federation, Israel, Ukraine, Iran and China spoke in exercise of the right of reply.\n\nThe General Assembly will next meet at 3 p.m. on Thursday, 8 September, to continue its work.\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nABDULLA SHAHID (Maldives), President of the General Assembly, said that the International Day against Nuclear Tests is observed on 29 August to commemorate the closing of Semipalatinsk, a nuclear test site in Kazakhstan, on 29 August 1991. The yearly observance commemorates all those who tragically lost their lives to nuclear tests, as well as a reminder of the serious impacts those tests have on human health and environment, which can last generations. \"We must ensure that we have a strong and united and most importantly global front in our mission to ban nuclear testing,\" he said, calling on the international community to implement all existing instruments towards that end. In that regard, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty provides a strong legal framework, he said, stressing: \"Twenty-five years after its adoption, we must redouble efforts to promote its universalization and implementation.\" Member States who had not yet signed the Treaty should do so without delay, particularly the remaining Annex II States, as their ratification is needed for the Treaty to enter into force.\n\nHe went on to say that the ongoing military confrontation in Ukraine, which has exacerbated the looming threat of a nuclear catastrophe by accident, has increased the urgency of nuclear disarmament efforts. He urged all parties to work to exercise maximum restraint and promote dialogue and diplomacy. With an estimated stockpile of 13,000 nuclear warheads around the world, all Member States without exception must fulfil their commitments towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Recalling the holding of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons in August, he highlighted States parties efforts and commitment during intensive negotiations, despite an outcome document not being adopted.\n\nHe voiced his hope that States parties will continue to engage in constructive and meaningful dialogue to reaffirm their commitment to that treaty as a corner stone of global disarmament and non-proliferation regime. \"As we mark the international day against nuclear tests, let us recommit by working together and taking concrete action. The only way of bringing hope to the people is by delivering a world free of nuclear weapons,\" he emphasized. \"Let us work together to achieve that world.\"\n\nIZUMI NAKAMITSU, High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, affirming that \"nuclear testing is abhorrent and its legacy is nothing but toxic\", stressed that the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty must remain an urgent priority for all States. She described the inability, last month, of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach consensus on a substantive outcome as \"a lost opportunity\" to strengthen the Treaty and advance its goals. While parties had engaged in sincere and meaningful dialogue, and were prepared to join the consensus, only one State party had objections on the draft final outcome document.\n\nNonetheless, she said a key issue on which States parties were united was their overwhelming support for a global ban on nuclear testing, noting that, in the draft outcome document, the Conference reaffirmed the importance of the entry into force of the Test-Ban Treaty at the earliest possible date, as a means to constrain the development and improvement of nuclear weapons. Also in the draft, the Conference welcomed the increased attention in the last review cycle on assistance to the people and communities affected by weapons testing and environmental remediation, building on the obligations contained in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and the work States parties have done to establish a process for their implementation.\n\nA focus on victim assistance is one area of progress that has grown from the International Day against Nuclear Tests, she continued, underscoring that it adds a human security dimension to the national and collective security perspectives. Indeed, the devastation wrought by explosive nuclear tests has lingered for decades, tormenting not just people who lived in the era of unrestrained atmospheric and underwater nuclear tests, but their succeeding generations. Stressing that the global norm against nuclear testing has been firmly upheld in the twenty-first century, with one important exception, she joined others in calling on the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to refrain from further nuclear testing, to join the Test-Ban Treaty and to immediately work with relevant parties towards the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nRecalling that September 2021 marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Test-Ban Treaty, she spotlighted that, under the \"relentless energy\" of Executive Secretary Floyd, four States have joined the instrument. She expressed hope that this will motivate the eight remaining Annex II States whose ratification is required for its entry into force to sign and ratify the Test Ban Treaty and provide impetus for the rest of the non-Annex II States, of which fewer than 12 now remain, to join it.\n\n\"Times are not good,\" she observed. The risk of nuclear weapons use is the highest since the cold war. Relationships between nuclear-armed States continue to corrode, and nuclear weapons are assuming greater roles in national security doctrines. Further, there are new reports about a possible resumption of nuclear testing by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. \"If we are to prevent catastrophe, we must urgently correct course and accelerate efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament,\" she stressed. Ending testing once and for all, by bringing the Test-Ban Treaty into force and making the legally binding prohibition on nuclear explosive tests a permanent reality, is a step all must strive to take. She called for redoubled efforts towards this outcome, and in turn, realizing the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.\n\nROBERT FLOYD, Executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization , said that, although the Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons recently concluded deliberations without consensus on a final document, he saw cause for optimism. Despite the disappointing outcome, he observed many delegations sincere and tireless efforts and heard the resounding calls for action. \"These four weeks of intense negotiations have laid the groundwork for real progress in the future,\" he said. Turning to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, he said that, in this, the twenty-fifth anniversary year of the opening for signature of the Treaty, Dominica, Gambia, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu ratified the Treaty, with many more States on their way. \"With Dominicas ratification, we have completed adherence to the CTBT in the Latin American and Caribbean region. With Timor-Lestes ratification, we have complete adherence in South-East Asia,\" he reported, highlighting them as historical milestones and commending those countries for their efforts.\n\nThe Treaty Organizations means of verification comprises a state-of-the-art international data centre and a global network of monitoring stations, which have proven their efficacy time and again, he continued. This critical asset will continue to deliver on the promise to detect any nuclear explosion, anytime, anywhere. For that reason, it must be properly sustained. Moreover, the data gathered contributes to tsunami warning systems, earthquake and climate change studies, as well as a multitude of other civil and scientific applications. As such, he has launched the National Data Centres for All Initiative an effort to ensure that all States signatories of the Treaty can use this data to the fullest, for the benefit of all, particularly the smallest of States. Despite those impressive achievements, the international communitys work is not yet done. The only way there can be an enduring and verifiable prohibition on nuclear testing is through the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \"So, to each of you, and the nations of the world that you represent, lets recommit ourselves to this noble cause, and lets finish what we started,\" he said.\n\nVIVIAN OKEKE, Representative of the Director General to the United Nations and Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Liaison Office, New York, speaking on behalf of Director General, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that, for the past six decades, IAEA has helped to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, while making nuclear science and technology available for peaceful purposes, especially to developing countries. In fact, nuclear science and technology contribute directly to more than half of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and indirectly to all of them. It cures diseases, helps feed the hungry, protects the environment and powers progress without harming the planet.\n\nOutlining its efforts, she recalled that IAEA responded quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic by delivering to Member States the biggest emergency response programme in its near seven-decade history. It launched the Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action initiative, or ZODIAC, which helps countries prepare and respond to zoonotic outbreak. The \"Rays of Hope\" project, meanwhile, steps up the Agencys commitment to cancer control, while the Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellowship offers financial support to women studying towards a masters degree in nuclear subjects. IAEA also develops safety standards that can be used as the basis for national regulations and provides, upon request, various services, including expert review missions. Countries increasingly seek IAEA help in minimizing the risk of nuclear and other radioactive material falling into the hands of terrorists.\n\nAnother core IAEA function is to verify that countries are not working to acquire nuclear weapons, she continued. Agency inspectors conduct verification at nuclear facilities all over the world, bringing back samples which are analysed for possible traces of nuclear material. As the competent authority entrusted to verify States compliance with their non-proliferation obligations, the Agency does this by implementing safeguards internationally approved legal and technical measures in 187 States, of which 184are States parties to the NonProliferation Treaty. Further, 139 of these States have brought additional protocols into force, giving the Agency greater access to locations and information.\n\nShe also noted that the Director General sends letters recalling these obligations, urging States with small quantities protocols based on the old standard text to amend or rescind them. \"This is essential to addressing a weakness in the IAEA safeguards system,\" recognized by the Board of Governors 15 years ago, she explained. Turning to IAEAs efforts in Ukraine, she said the Agencys Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia, deployed last week to assess the situation, has now set up a presence at the plant. The Director Generals second report details IAEAs actions, findings and recommendations for nuclear safety, security and safeguards in Ukraine, including a call for the urgent establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the plant. She also pointed to the low enriched uranium bank in Kazakhstan, operational since December 2019, as another milestone, as well as assistance offered to States to characterize residual radioactivity in areas affected by nuclear weapons tests.\n\nBENETICK KABUA MADDISON, Director of the Marshallese Educational Initiative , said the Marshall Islands has been the home of its people for more than 4,000 years. Marshallese culture is based on principles of sustainability and conservation. Unfortunately, the sustainable way of life is under threat. The Marshallese people are on the front line of climate change, with environmental challenges and exploitation of the Marshall Islands resources forcing more families like his own to migrate.\n\nHe went on to say that, between 1946 to 1958, the United States used the Marshall Islands to test 67 nuclear weapons, equivalent to 7,200 Hiroshima bonds. In the late 1970s, the United States built a concrete dome on Eniwetak, one of two islands used for nuclear testing. They dumped nuclear waste into the structure, which is now leaking nuclear contaminants into the environment. As a result of the nucleartesting programme, the Marshall Islands and the United States signed the first compact of free association in 1986, allowing Marshallese to migrate to the United States for employment, education and the hope of access to health care.\n\nDue to nuclear testing and forced relocation, Marshallese have some of highest rates of cancer and diabetes in the world, he pointed out. They are also especially vulnerable to COVID-19 due to health issues that are a direct result of radiation exposure and forced relocation. With a long history of advocacy for environmental and nuclear justice and with allies worldwide, Marshallese political leaders and community advocates are continuing to fight for nuclear and climate justice. With the help of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, the Marshall Islands sued nine nuclearweapon States in 2014. Although the case was not won, the issue received international attention and support.\n\nThe Marshall Islands will continue to educate and raise awareness of effects of nuclear testing and climate change, he stated. \"What we need most today is not only allies but actors,\" he said, calling on Government leaders to recognize the dangers of nuclear weapons production and use, take responsibility for the damage thy have inflicted and then eliminate such weapons. The Marshall Islands and the United States recently restarted negotiations for the next compact of free association, he noted, voicing hope that the next compact will fully and fairly address the nuclear legacy and climate change.\n\nStatements\n\nJAGDISH DHARAMCHAND KOONJUL ( Mauritius ), speaking for the African Group, and adding his support for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, reiterated the urgent need for the planet, including outer space, to be free of nuclear weapons. Also expressing support for the principle of complete nuclear disarmament, he said all parties, especially nuclearweapon States and those under the \"nuclear umbrella\", must sign and ratify the Treaty. The slow pace of nuclearweapon States in eliminating their nuclear arsenals, in accordance with their article VI obligations, was very concerning, he said.\n\nThe Treaty of Pelindaba reaffirms the status of Africa as a nuclear-weapon-free zone and shield for the African territory, by preventing the stationing of nuclear explosive devices on the continent, he continued. He underlined the continued validity of the 1995 resolution, which is the basis upon which the NonProliferation was indefinitely extended, calling on all States to consider the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons on health, the environment and other resources. Having two failed Review Conferences back-to-back plunges the Non-Proliferation Treaty into \"uncharted waters\", he said, leaving its credibility \"in deep trouble\". He called on all States that have yet to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to do so.\n\nMAGZHAN ILYASSOV ( Kazakhstan ) stressed that nuclear weapons are now moving from global to regional deterrence, increasing hazardous conditions in the case of an actual nuclear war between State actors. Further, the risk of cybercrime attacks and weapons falling in the hands of terrorists is also challenging. \"Even the possibility of using one or two of the 13,000 nuclear warheads existing today, is enough to destroy us and our planet,\" he reported. Thus, he urged that new nuclear-weapon-free zones be established, particularly in the Middle East, and similar to what exists in Africa, South America, South-East Asia and the Pacific the entire Southern hemisphere. In 2009, his country, together with its neighbours, created a Nuclear-WeaponFree Zone in Central Asia, the first in the Northern hemisphere, flanked by two mighty nuclear-weapon-possessing States. The entry into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons earlier this year strengthens Member States collective hope for a world free of nuclear weapons. Proposing Member States achieve Global Zero by the United Nations centennial in 2045, he said it was a goal worth striving for and not impossible to reach. \"Let us not forget the horrific consequences of nuclear weapons used in 1945 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the haunting tragedies of four decades of nuclear weapons testing in Kazakhstan, the South Pacific, North Africa, North America and other regions,\" he said, urging the remaining Annex II States to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty without delay.\n\nSURIYA CHINDAWONGSE ( Thailand ), speaking for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said solidarity on nuclear issues is essential, particularly amid the unsettling global geopolitical landscape. Describing current concerns as \"real and existential\", he called on all States to show good faith, promote mutual understanding and take responsible, collective actions to promote a peaceful world. He also reaffirmed ASEANs position against nuclear tests and underscored the importance of achieving universal adherence to the Test-Ban Treaty. Noting that all ASEAN member States have ratified that instrument, he urged remaining Annex II States to sign and ratify the treaty as soon as possible. He deplored the conduct of nuclear tests, recognizing their dire humanitarian consequences on health, the environment and sustainable development. Further, he voiced his regret that the tenth Review Conference of the Parties was unable to produce an outcome document.\n\nRecognizing the role of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in efforts to foster peace, security and sustainable development, he urged all States parties to renew their adherence to the Treaty, including its article VI. ASEAN is committed to maintaining its region as a zone free from nuclear weapons, he said, as outlined in the Treaty of Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, or \"Bangkok Treaty\". Recalling that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons an historic accord held its first meeting of States parties in June, he expressed support for the Secretary-Generals disarmament agenda to advance these goals in a holistic and integrated manner. He also cited the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas intercontinental ballistic missile launch as a threat to the region, stressing that diplomatic efforts including the creation of a conducive environment for peaceful dialogue should remain the goal.\n\nSILVIO GONZATO, representative of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, said all European Union member States have ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. He called upon the remaining eight Annex II States: China, Egypt, Iran, Israel and the United States who still need to ratify the Treaty, and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, India and Pakistan who still need to sign and ratify the Treaty in order to bring it into force, to do so without any preconditions or further delay. He also called on all States to abide by the moratorium on nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions, and to refrain from any action contrary to the object and purpose of the Treaty, pending its entry into force. Voicing regret that, due to one countrys objection, it has not been possible to achieve consensus on a final outcome document at the tenth Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, he said the bloc will continue to promote the full and effective implementation of that Treaty, as well as its universalization, and called on all States Parties to do the same.\n\nTurning to the current security environment, he called on the Russian Federation to end its aggression immediately and withdraw its troops from Ukraine. He also urged the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to cease its unlawful and destabilizing actions that undermine regional and international peace and security. He recalled that, following that countrys nuclear tests, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization quickly provided reliable and independent data, enabling the international community to respond appropriately and swiftly. \"The CTBTO has provided the world with a truly global, high-tech monitoring system for nuclear explosions something that no single country could do,\" he said. Moreover, the Treaty Organizations integrated capacity-building assists States in using \"IM35S data\" for civil and scientific applications and research associated with Treaty-related verification technologies, including tsunami and volcanic ash cloud warning. Since 2006, the European Union has provided the Treaty Organization with voluntary contributions of more than 29.5 million to fund a variety of technical projects to strengthen the verification regime and build capacity in developing countries.\n\nMARA DEL CARMEN SQUEFF ( Argentina ), speaking for the Community of Latin America and Caribbean States (CELAC), recalled resolutions 64/35 of 2009 and 72/51 of 2017, declaring 29 August as International Day against Nuclear Tests. She condemned the conduct of any nuclear tests, insisting that all States refrain from carrying them out, including through simulations seeking to improve their efficiency. These actions contravene the purpose of the non-proliferation regime, the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, she said, recalling that 186 Member States signed and 174 ratified the latter instrument, and welcoming ratifications completed this year by the Gambia, TimorLeste and Tuvalu an important step towards universalization.\n\nShe also welcomed Dominicas signing and ratification of the accord. In Latin America, all States have signed the instrument, demonstrating the regions commitment to universalization. She underscored the urgency of implementing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, pressing Annex II States to take measures to do so without delay. She expressed deep concern over the rise, modernization, use and threat thereof of nuclear weapons, stressing that these weapons should not be used under any circumstances, as this would constitute a crime against humanity. Drawing attention to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean known as the Treaty of Tlatelolco she reiterated the blocs commitment to maintaining the region as a nuclearweaponfree zone.\n\nMAX HUFANEN RAI ( Papua New Guinea ), speaking for the Pacific Islands Forum, said the unresolved nuclear testing legacy issues in the Pacific region continue to pose a clear and present danger to the livelihoods of the peoples there. He called on those responsible to take urgent and meaningful steps to address these lingering issues. A preliminary independent review relating to nuclear contamination in the Pacific will support the evidentiary basis for actions that his region continues to take on nuclear testing legacy issues. The nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific represents a key contribution to protecting all of humankind from nuclear weapons and testing. The Treaty of Rarotonga successfully eliminated nuclear weapons and testing from the Pacific 26 years ago and has helped to denuclearize a number of regions of the world, he said, calling on the United States to ratify the Rarotonga Treatys Protocols.\n\nHe urged all States to not carry out nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions; maintain their moratoria in that regard; and refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty. Condemning the six nuclear tests conducted by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea since 2006, he urged full compliance with obligations under relevant Council resolutions. Further, the climate emergency and growing frequency of natural disasters across the globe has increased the risk of large-scale nuclear accidents. He called on the international community to join his bloc in pursuing the highest standards of nuclear safety through international consultation, international law and support for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), voicing hope for global solidarity to safeguard against further nuclear contamination and injustices.\n\nTAREK LADEB ( Tunisia ), speaking for the Arab Group, called for the complete, verifiable and irreversible ban on nuclear weapons and expressed regret that the tenth Review Conference of State Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty was unable to adopt an outcome document. States are developing nuclear weapons in line with their military doctrines and carrying out tests, an existential threat that the international community must diligently address. The full elimination of nuclear weapons is a realistic, achievable goal, he stressed, adding that the real threat was the non-implementation of the Treatys article VI or commitments adopted at various Review Conferences. He rejected the argument that the possession of nuclear weapons is a pretext for global stability, calling on States to ensure the complete elimination of their arsenals along a defined timeline as \"the very least\" they can do to address the impact of their testing.\n\nHe called for continued international and regional efforts to facilitate the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which has been signed for more than 25 years. Arab States have joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty, participated in negotiations for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and supported efforts of the preparatory committee. The region was a striking example of the persistent challenges, as Israel violates all norms and rules set by the NonProliferation Treaty. He called for ridding the region of all weapons of mass destruction, in line with the 1995 and 2010 Review Conferences, and Security Council resolutions 487 (1981) and 678 (1990). He urged all parties to negotiate a legally binding convention that promotes international and regional peace and security.\n\nRight of Reply\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation , speaking in exercise of the right of reply, objected to politicized statements on the unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, despite the fact that explanations have been presented on several occasions. The most flagrant threat to the Zaporizhzhia plant stems from Ukraines unceasing shelling. \"This bombardment continues daily,\" targeting the most vulnerable part of the station, he pointed out. The Russian Federation has released statistics to the Security Council, which he encouraged all to analyse. While Western delegations understand where the shells come from, they refuse to recognize that Kyiv has turned the plant into a target of nuclear blackmail.\n\nHe said claims that the shelling does not emanate from Ukraine \"simply contradict common sense because the station is under Russian control\". To claims about the outcome of the tenth Review Conference, he said his delegation worked constructively with all partners, yet Western countries took the forum \"hostage\" in their desire to punish his country \"at all costs\", making it impossible for the outcome to be adopted. He recalled, however, that, in 2015, the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, guided by selfish considerations, blocked the outcome of the ninth Review Conference. The Russian Federation has always supported and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 2000, he said, urging all Annex II States to support the instrument and stressing that nuclear tests must be considered through a holistic approach. He also recalled that 1,054 tests had been carried out by the United States.\n\nThe representative of Israel , recognizing the importance of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, said all States have the sovereign right to determine whether to join any international instrument. Iran obstructs such international efforts. Some claim a security architecture can be established in the Middle East without recognition of Israels right to exist and in disregard of norms and principles agreed upon in arms control forums. \"This position is untenable,\" he said.\n\nThe representative of Ukraine said the Russian Federation is promoting its classic narrative around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. \"We are not surprised,\" he said, noting that the Council meeting on 6 September revealed again how isolated the Russian Federation is, a point confirmed by its delegate who said there was no time to consider the IAEA report. Only one delegation the Russian Federation is responsible for nuclear threats and risks around the plant. The IAEA report confirmed the presence of Russian military and equipment at the plant, and violation by the Russian Federation of the seven IAEA pillars of nuclear safety and security. \"It is only Russa that uses military force,\" he said, insisting that Ukraine has been very clear, including at the tenth Review Conference and in the Security Council that the Russian Federation bears full responsibility for its actions and presents a clear threat to nuclear safety and stability.\n\nThe representative of Iran categorically rejected the outrageous accusation made by Israel against his country, describing it as a policy of deflection and emphasizing that weapons of mass destruction in the hands of this regime are the real risk to regional security. He encouraged the international community to force Israel to ban weapons of mass destruction.\n\nInternational Cooperation/Access to Justice for Sexual Violence Survivors\n\nFollowing the Assemblys adoption on 2 September of a resolution titled \"International Cooperation for Access to Justice, Remedies and Assistance for Survivors of Sexual Violence\" (document A/76/L.80), it resumed consideration of the topic today, with various delegations speaking in explanation of vote after action. (For background, see Press Release GA/12438.)\n\nThe representative of Guatemala said her country, in accordance with the provisions of its Constitution regarding the protection of life from conception, dissociates itself from operative paragraph 6. It contains references to sexual and reproductive rights, as well as to abortion in conditions of safety when such services are allowed by national legislation; that could be interpreted as abortion practices, which is counter to its national legislation. Her Government implements a comprehensive care model for women victims of violence, which offers immediate and comprehensive care.\n\nThe representative of Syria voiced regret that the amendments proposed by Nigeria were not included in the text. His delegation has always been against instrumentalizing the text to deviate from \"survivors of sexual violence\". However, the resolution is full of references to \"gender-based violence\" which cannot substantiate nor substitute the terms \"sexual violence\" and \"violence against women\". Citing various paragraphs and terms from which his delegation has disassociated itself, he said the adoption of the resolution cannot be interpreted as creating a new right or creating any international legally binding obligations.\n\nThe representative of India said his country joined consensus on the resolution. However, due to the use of phrases and terminology which do not have agreed definitions, and given that India is not part of some of the international conventions and instruments contained in the text, his delegation disassociates itself from preambular paragraphs 2, 10, 11 and 16, and operative paragraph 6.\n\nThe representative of Belarus said her delegation could not support the full draft, due to wording that is not universally supported and that shift the issues from the legal element to concepts that are not agreed upon internationally. Belarus co-sponsored the amendments in effort to create a more balanced text. She expressed regret that they were not adopted. While expressing full support for the goals of the resolution, she said Belarus will interpret the text in line with its national legislation and international legal obligations. She called on partners to respect the decisions of all Member States and avoid to terms that sow divisions among Assembly delegations.\n\nThe representative of Pakistan voiced regret that non-consensual language and controversial terms, although not agreed upon, were retained in certain paragraphs of the resolution. Those terms are also not recognized by his countrys domestic laws, he said, stressing that the negotiations process should be inclusive and consensual. While his delegation fully supports the overarching theme of the resolution, it reserves its position and disassociates itself from preambular paragraphs 8 and 16 and operative paragraphs 2(a) and 6 for the same reason that it voted in favour of the amendments to those paragraphs.\n\nThe representative of Sudan , spotlighting paragraphs 2(a) and 6 said she attached great importance to the advancement of womens rights and participation in society at all levels. However, the text deviated from its goal with the inclusion of contentious wording and terminology. She emphasized the principle of respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal State affairs, explaining that Sudan voted in favour of the amendments to make the resolution \"balanced, acceptable and agreed upon\". As they were not retained, she expressed reservations on operative paragraphs 8, 16 and 6.\n\nThe representative of Egypt said that, while her delegation joined consensus due to importance of the topic at hand, the resolution would have been improved in terms of legal accuracy, including of the word \"victims\" in the title. She lamented the lack of transparency and fairness in the negotiation process, stressing that programme budget implications were used as bargaining chip. This method is unprecedented and threatens common ownership. She cited preambular paragraphs 8, 16 and 3, and operative paragraphs 2 and 6, noting that her delegation does not consider the language as consensual or agreed.\n\nThe representative of Algeria expressed regret that the amendments were not included in the text, as they would have made it more balanced as a whole, representing the positions of several countries expressed since its tabling. She expressed reservations on terms such as \"multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination\" and \"intimate partner\", which can be interpreted in various ways. \"We should not promote abortion as a means of family planning,\" she added, cautioning agencies from interfering in the domestic policies of States. Further, the concept of sexual and reproductive health and rights is considered part of health care, in line with Algerias national legislation, she pointed out.\n\nThe representative of Brazil said his delegation decided to support adoption of the resolution. However, it contains important aspects that do not belong in the text and would be better addressed by domestic constituencies. In particular, his country does not support references to reproductive rights or abortion in the draft and has called for their deletion from the text. The resolution should not be interpreted in any way as condoning or supporting abortion as a matter of family planning. In Brazil, abortion is illegal except in specific cases prescribed by law or high court decisions, such as pregnancy resulting from rape.\n\nThe representative of Libya said his delegation joined consensus in adopting the entire resolution. However, he said that he cannot accept text that has been incorporated in some of the paragraphs of the resolution, as they do not take into consideration the cultural and religious specificities of certain countries, including his own. With respect to various terms, including \"intimate partner\" and \"gender-based violence\", his delegation does not accept its interpretation, except as violence against girls, boys, men and women. Also, it does not accept references to \"safe abortion\" because it runs counter to the right to life a foundation for all human rights. His delegation supported the four proposed amendments to the draft and voted against operative paragraph 6.\n\nThe representative of Mauritania , stressing that abortion is not a human right, said her country disassociates itself from operative paragraph 6. It is a prerogative of national policies that the Government must provide necessary social support and health care prior to and after delivery. Citing objections to language in other paragraphs of the resolution, she voiced regret that language, which has not garnered international consensus and is not provided for in its national policies or laws, are included in the text.\n\nThe representative of Nigeria , citing highly problematic language, said his delegation could not join consensus on the text. Certain terms contravene Nigerias laws and he denounced the inflexibility of the co-sponsors. \"We never agreed to a single paragraph by consensus,\" he said. The proposed amendments were based on well-known positions, in the spirit of compromise. However, the cosponsors would not entertain them, and he urged them to do better in the future. He announced Nigerias withdrawal from the core group, as it introduced controversial language. He also said that some delegations felt intimidated and pressured, a sign that \"the negotiations were deeply flawed\".\n\nBecause of his objection to the introduction of controversial language by the co-sponsors that had no basis in international human rights law, he disassociated his delegation from operative paragraph 6, which promotes access to safe abortion as an element of human rights. \"We should not be creating new rights,\" he said, noting that abortion is illegal in his country. He also objected to \"access to sexual and reproductive health services\", noting that operative paragraph 6 is misinterpreted by donors and partners.\n\nIn addition, he disassociated from references to \"multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination\" in preambular paragraphs 8 and 2(a), and the phase \"intimate partner violence\" in paragraph 16, which includes ideas that are not recognized in Nigerias laws. He clarified that the term \"gender\" has no meaning beyond \"male\" and \"female\". Nigerias opposition to these paragraphs is in defence of its values, domestic laws and sovereignty, he added.\n\nThe representative of Malaysia welcomed the presentation of a stand-alone resolution on the important topic, a sign of the shared international recognition of the need to address sexual violence. He voiced regret that the text includes \"divisive, contentious terms\" that are inconsistent with positions of many countries. While his delegation would like to support the text to provide survivors with proper access to justice, the inclusion of problematic terms \"by choice\" prevented it from so doing. Therefore, his delegation disassociates from such terms as \"multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination\" and \"diverse situations\" found in preambular paragraph 8 and operative paragraphs 2(a), 2(k) and 6. Malaysia does not recognize these terms as agreed language, despite the consensual adoption of the text as a whole, he said.\n\nThe representative of Ethiopia pointed out that no consensus was reached due to a lack of openness to listen and accommodate the concerns of several delegations. The process could have been inclusive and not involved nonconsensual language. Every process must aim at consensus, be inclusive and seek a focused outcome. Each nation has a right take sovereign position on issues, depending on their national context. His delegation disassociates from terms such as \"multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination\" in preambular paragraph 8 and operative paragraph 2(a), as well as \"intimate partner violence\" in preambular paragraph 16.\n\nHe said he understood \"sexual and reproductive health service, and reproductive rights\", as access to health care to ensure the health of mothers, new-borns and young people by improving treatment, family planning and information on sexually transmitted diseases, among other issues. As well, he defined the term \"gender\" as referring to the male and female sex. Further, Ethiopia is not a party to the Rome Statute and does not recognize the International Criminal Court, its jurisdiction or reference to the tribunal in the text, he said.\n\nThe representative of Japan said his delegation voted against the four draft amendments presented by Nigeria to the draft resolution since the relevant paragraphs to which the amendments were proposed are based on language adopted by consensus or by vote in past resolutions. He thanked all delegations that supported the original language and all delegations that joined consensus in adopting the firstever resolution on the topic. He also thanked delegations, which had some issues on the text, but did not ask for a vote for the sake of consensual adoption.\n\nNoting the \"somewhat politicized references\" to his country by two delegations during the debate and explanation of vote on 2 September, he said his country decided to contribute to the process in light of its \"responsibility to continue to inherit the past in all humbleness and pass it on to the future\".\n\nRight of Reply",

Russia and Ukraine say they fear a Chernobyl-like catastrophe due to shelling they blame on each other.\n\nRussia seized the plant early in the now more than six-month-old war, and areas to the south are now the focus of a major Ukrainian counter-offensive. Kyiv accuses Moscow of using the facility to shield its forces, a charge Moscow denies while rejecting calls to withdraw troops.\n\nAfter touring the plant on Thursday, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said his inspectors were \"not going anywhere\". Grossi and other members of the team left for Ukrainian-held territory but five IAEA inspectors remain at the plant, Ukraines state nuclear company says.\n\nThe inspectors will assess physical damage to the plant, ensure its safety and security systems are functional and evaluate the conditions of the facilitys staff, the IAEA says. Grossi said on Thursday they would produce a report on their findings.\n\nSince its capture by Russia in March, the plant has been controlled by Russian troops but operated by Ukrainian staff. On Thursday, one of its reactors was forced to shut down due to shelling.\n\nIn a video address late on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his frequent calls that all troops be removed from the plant a demand supported by Kyivs Western allies and the United Nations.\n\n\"The main thing that must happen is the demilitarisation of the stations territory,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Demilitarisation and full control of Ukrainian nuclear workers.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday Moscow was doing everything to ensure that the plant could operate safely, and for the IAEA inspectors to be able to complete their tasks.\n\nUkrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko said on Thursday it was being discussed that certain IAEA specialists \"up to two individuals\" will be permanently stationed at the plant.\n\n\"But it is important for us that the station must be under national control, meaning that the station must be returned to the control of Ukraine,\" he told Ukraines 1+1 television channel.\n\nSeveral towns near the nuclear plant came under Russian shelling on Thursday, damaging homes and other buildings, Zaporizhzhia regional council mayor Mykola Lukashuk said. Reuters was unable to independently confirm this.\n\nCounter-offensive\n\nThe plant sits on the south bank of a huge reservoir on the Dnipro River that divides Russian and Ukrainian forces in central southern Ukraine. Before the war, it supplied more than a fifth of Ukraines electricity.\n\nUkrainian officials have welcomed the IAEA visit, expressing hope that it will lead to the demilitarisation of the plant.\n\nRussian-installed officials have suggested the IAEA team would have only a day to inspect the plant, while the nuclear watchdogs team has prepared for longer.\n\nThe head of the International Committee of the Red Cross called for all fighting near the plant to stop, warning that little could be done to respond in the event of a potential nuclear leak.\n\n\"(It) will be difficult if not impossible to provide humanitarian assistance and this is why fighting should stop,\" Robert Mardini told a news conference during a visit to Ukraine on Thursday.\n\nUkraine has launched an offensive in recent days to recapture territory in southern Ukraine, mainly further down the Dnipro in neighbouring Kherson province.\n\nBoth sides have claimed battlefield successes in the new Ukrainian push to recapture territory in the south, although details have been scarce so far, with Ukrainian officials releasing little information about their advance.\n\n\"It is a very slow process, because we value people,\" said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskyy. Moscow has denied reports of Ukrainian progress and said its troops had routed Ukrainian forces.\n\nReuters could not independently verify those claims.\n\nUkraines military said late on Thursday that Russian forces had shelled around a dozen southern towns, with attacks in other regions including Kharkiv in the north and Donetsk in the east.\n\nMillions of people have fled Ukraine, thousands have been killed and cities have been reduced to rubble in what Kyiv and the West call Russias unprovoked war of aggression.\n\nMoscow calls its actions a \"special military operation\" to rid Ukraine of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities.\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

The much-awaited arrival of the IAEA team was delayed for several hours due to increased military activity as Russia and Ukraine accused each other of shelling near the site. Read our live blog to see how all the day's events unfolded. All times are Paris time (GMT+2).\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi speaks with journalists after he and part of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team returned from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, on September 1, 2022.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThis live page is no longer being updated. For more of our coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n10:30pm: UN inspectors at nuclear plant 'not going anywhere'\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Grossi has spoken to reporters upon crossing back into Ukrainian-held territory after leading a team of nuclear inspectors to the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia plant in southeastern Ukraine.\n\nGrossi said he had been able to tour the entire site, seeing key areas such as the emergency systems and control rooms. His team would now need to do a lot of work to finish its analysis of worrisome technical aspects.\n\n\"We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving it's going to stay there,\" a tired-looking Grossi said after what he called a long day.\n\n04:04 Reuters\n\nThe IAEA chief said members of his team would stay at the plant to provide an impartial, technical assessment of what is happening on the ground. They would dig deeper into conditions and deliver a report.\n\n\"It is obvious that the plant and the physical integrity of the plant have been violated, several times ... This is something that cannot continue to happen,\" he said.\n\n10:15pm: Grain ship from Ukraine grounded in Istanbul, halting traffic\n\nA cargo ship carrying 3,000 tonnes of corn from Ukraine under a UN-brokered export deal has drifted aground in Turkey's Bosphorus strait, halting shipping through Istanbul, according to the governor's office and a shipping firm.\n\nThe Istanbul governor's office said the 173-meter \"Lady Zehma\" was safely grounded and anchored after a rudder failure around 1800 GMT. No one was hurt and Coast Guards were attending, it said.\n\nEarlier this week the Joint Coordination Centre run by the United Nations, Ukraine, Russia and Turkey after a grains-export deal was reached said the Lady Zehma was cleared to depart Ukraine's Chornomorsk port for Ravenna, Italy, with 3,000 tonnes of corn.\n\n7:15am: IAEA presence at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant 'hugely beneficial'\n\nA long-term or permanent presence by IAEA nuclear inspectors at the Zaporizhzhia plant in Ukraine \"would be hugely beneficial\" in terms of easing fears of a nuclear incident, says Dr Ross Peel, a nuclear expert at Kings College London.\n\nSuch a presence \"would allow constant monitoring of conditions at the plant, real independent evidence coming out constantly about what is going on there,\" he told FRANCE 24, noting that \"disinformation and misinformation have played a huge role so far in this conflict\".\n\n\"Shelling near any nuclear site is obviously a grave concern and we should be avoiding that whenever possible,\" Dr Peel said. \"Even when shells are targeted away from critical systems, things can go off target.\"\n\n05:32\n\nThe nuclear expert said IAEA inspectors would be looking to determine \"what the conditions have been for workers at the plant\" and whether they have been able \"to perform their duties safely\".\n\nHe added: \"I expect they will find signs of several damage to the plant and its systems but hopefully (the damage) can be addressed.\"\n\n6:45pm: Gorbachev died 'shocked and bewildered' by Ukraine war\n\nMikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader who died on Tuesday aged 91, was shocked and bewildered by the Ukraine conflict and saddened by years of worsening ties between Moscow and Kyiv, his interpreter has said.\n\nPavel Palazhchenko, who worked with the late Soviet president for 37 years and was at his side at numerous US-Soviet summits, spoke to Gorbachev a few weeks ago by phone and said he and others had been struck by how traumatised he was by events in Ukraine.\n\n\"It's not just the (military) operation that started on Feb. 24, but the entire evolution of relations between Russia and Ukraine over the past years that was really, really a big blow to him. It really crushed him emotionally and psychologically,\" Palazhchenko told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\"It was very obvious to us in our conversations that he was shocked and bewildered by what was happening. He believed not just in the closeness of the Russian and Ukrainian people, he believed that those two nations were intermingled,\" Palazhchenko added.\n\n44:16 Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev died in a Moscow hospital on August 30, 2022, aged 91. Boris Yurchenko, AP\n\n5:12pm: Ukraine working to switch reactor back on at occupied nuclear plant, says Energoatom chief\n\nThe IAEA visit to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will be successful if it leads to the plant's \"demilitarization\", the head of Ukraine's state nuclear company told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.\n\nUkraine is also making \"all efforts\" to switch the plant's fifth reactor back on after it shut down due to shelling early on Thursday.\n\n4:46: IAEA chief Grossi says he saw what 'needed to see', IAEA 'will be staying' at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Thursday he saw what he \"needed to see\" at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that has been frequently shelled.\n\n\"I think we were able in these few hours to put together a lot, a lot of information. The key things I needed to see I saw, and your explanations were very clear,\" Rafael Grossi told Russian media accompanying the IAEA inspection team at the Moscow-controlled atomic plant.\n\n\"The IAEA is staying here. Let the world know that the IAEA is staying at Zaporizhzhia,\" Grossi said in a video released by the Russian RIA Novosti news agency. He did not specify how many people will be staying and for how long.\n\n4:43pm: Nuclear inspectors seen leaving Zaporizhzhia plant\n\nSome members of an inspection team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were seen leaving the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine on Thursday after spending several hours at the site, a Reuters reporter on the scene said.\n\nFour of the nine vehicles from the IAEA delegation left the facility's territory, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.\n\n2:55pm: Macron vows to prevent Russia from winning the war\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to keep up France's humanitarian, economic and military support to Ukraine and to bolster European unity as a way to pile pressure on Russia and prevent it from winning the war.\n\n\"We cannot let Russia militarily win the war,\" Macron said in a speech to French ambassadors at the Elyse presidential palace.\n\nHe set the goal of enabling Ukraine to either win militarily or be put in a strong position to achieve \"a negotiated peace\".\n\n\"We must get prepared for a long war,\" Macron said, also defending his decision to continue talking with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.\n\n>> Read more: France's Macron vows long-term support for Ukraine\n\n1:38pm: IAEA team arrives at Zaporizhzhia plant: Ukraine's state nuclear company\n\nThe IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has arrived at the power station, Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom confirmed in a Telegram post.\n\nEarlier today, Energoatom said Russian shelling had forced the shutdown of one of only two operating reactors at the site, while Moscow said it had thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to seize the plant.\n\n12:52pm: Red Cross denied access to Ukrainian POWs in Olenivka\n\nRed Cross officials have failed to secure access to Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-controlled town of Olenivka in the Donetsk region, said the head of the international aid group.\n\nUkraine and Russia have traded accusations over a July attack in Olenivka that killed prisoners held by Moscow-backed separatists.\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross Director-General Robert Mardini told reporters in Kyiv that the group was engaged in intense negotiations with Russian authorities, but had not been granted access to those POWs and also lacked security guarantees to carry out such a visit.\n\nThe Red Cross registered 1,800 people taken from the besieged Azovstal steel works in the Ukrainian port of Mariupol, with the understanding that it would be allowed to visit them, but that has not been possible, said Mardini/\n\nOlenivka is about 90 km (55 miles) north of Mariupol.\n\n12:52pm: Russian troops 'forcibly transferring' Ukrainian civilians: HRW\n\nRussian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians, including those fleeing hostilities, to areas under their control, Human Rights Watch said in a major report released on Thursday.\n\nForced transfers \"are a serious violation of the laws of war amounting to a war crimes and a potential crime against humanity,\" the New York-based rights groups said.\n\nThe 71-page report, \"We Had No Choice: Filtration and the Crime of Forcibly Transferring Ukrainian Civilians to Russia,\" documents the harrowing experiences of Ukrainian civilians who went through filtration, had family members or friends who were transferred to Russia, or who supported Ukrainians trying to leave Russia. Most had fled the Mariupol area, and several were transferred from the Kharkiv region.\n\n10:22am: Russia doing 'everything' for Zaporizhzhia plant to operate safely: Lavrov\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has insisted that Moscow is doing everything to ensure that Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant can operate safely, and for IAEA inspectors to be able to complete their tasks.\n\n\"We are doing everything to ensure that this station is safe, that it functions safely, and for the mission there to carry out all its plans,\" said Lavrov at an event in Moscow.\n\n10:07am: 'Time to stop playing with fire' round Zaporizhzhia plant: ICRC chief\n\nThe Red Cross has called for a halt to all military operations around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, warning the consequences of a strike could be \"catastrophic\".\n\n\"It is high time to stop playing with fire and instead take concrete measures to protect this facility and others like it from any military operations,\" Robert Mardini, director general of the ICRC, told reporters in Kyiv.\n\n\"The slightest miscalculation could trigger devastations that we will regret for decades.\"\n\n8:56am: Very tense, very unclear situation in Zaporizhzhia city\n\nReporting from Zaporizhzhia city, FRANCE 24s James Andr said journalists saw the IAEA team getting ready to leave their hotel in Zaporizhzhia city for the nuclear plant early Thursday before IAEA chief Rafael Grossi spoke to reporters.\n\nGrossi said the team was \"aware\" of the military activity in the area, \"but were not stopping after coming so far\".\n\nRegarding the IAEA missions security situation, Andr explained the Russians and Ukrainians were locked in \"a blame game\" with each side accusing the other of attacking the Zaporizhzhia area and attempting to sabotage the mission. It's \"a very tense, very unclear situation unfolding here\", explained Andr as the UN inspection team heads for Europes largest nuclear power plant.\n\n02:38\n\n8:18am Russia accuses Ukraine of trying to capture Zaporizhzhia plant\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Ukrainian forces had attempted to seize the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant on Thursday morning.\n\nIn a statement, the ministry said that up to 60 Ukrainian troops had crossed the Dnipro river, which divides territory held by the two sides, in boats at 6am local time. It called the operation a \"provocation\" aimed at disrupting the IAEA's visit to the nuclear plant.\n\nThe ministry said that \"measures had been taken\" to destroy the opposing troops, including use of military aviation.\n\nThe report could not be immediately verified.\n\n8:05am Ukraine accuses Russia of shelling IAEA mission route\n\nRussian troops were shelling the route of the IAEA mission planned to allow them access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, said Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia region.\n\n\"The Russians are shelling the pre-agreed route of the IAEA mission from (the city of) Zaporizhzhia to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The UN advance team cannot continue to move due to security reasons,\" Starukh wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n7:37am: IAEA team 'pressing ahead' despite 'increased military activity'\n\nThe IAEA team has set off from Zaporizhzhia city towards the nuclear power plant in the Russian-controlled town of Enerhodar despite reports of intense shelling there.\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Grossi said the mission was aware of \"increased military activity in the area\" but was pressing ahead with its plan to visit the facility and meet its staff.\n\n6:38am: Moscow approves Japan stakes in Sakhalin energy project\n\nTwo Japanese trading houses will maintain stakes in a Russian energy project despite Tokyo joining sanctions on Moscow over the war in Ukraine, as the Asian country looks to secure its power supply.\n\nMoscow is transferring operation of the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project to a new Russian firm, with foreign stakeholders required to apply for approval to maintain their interests.\n\nLike other countries that have joined sanctions, Japan is seeking to reduce its reliance on Russian energy imports but struggling to find alternatives.\n\n5:05am: IAEA team expected to visit Zaporizhzhia plant soon\n\nInspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are expected to arrive at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine later today.\n\nThe inspection will take one or two days and six to eight IAEA experts are expected to stay at the plant following the visit, according to the Russian-installed officials in Enerhodar, the town where the plant is based.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian forces have accused each other of shelling the plant, actions that have raised concerns about a possible nuclear disaster.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and Reuters)\n\nFrance Mdias Monde graphic studio\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

Common sense and cooperation must guide the way forward. Any action that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant is unacceptable,\" he said.\n\nDemilitarized perimeter\n\nThe Secretary-General stressed that efforts to re-establish the plant as purely civilian infrastructure are vital.\n\n\"As a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces must commit not to engage in any military activity towards the plant site or from the plant site. The Zaporizhzhia facility and its surroundings must not be a target or a platform for military operations,\" he said.\n\nThe second step would entail securing an agreement on a demilitarized perimeter.\n\n\"Specifically, that would include a commitment by Russian forces to withdraw all military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and a commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move into it. Operators at the plant must be able to carry out their responsibilities, and communications must be maintained\".\n\nThe Secretary-General called for commitment to support inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stationed at the plant.\n\nFollowing months of negotiations, a 14-member team from the nuclear watchdog arrived there last week. Two will remain at the site, which has been under Russian control since the early days of the conflict.\n\n\"I trust that the IAEA experts now deployed to Zaporizhzhia will be able to carry out their work without hindrance and contribute to ensuring lasting nuclear safety and security at the plant. All of us have a stake in the success of their critical mission,\" he said.\n\nHistoric IAEA mission\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Mariano Grossi, who led the mission, had described it as \"historic\". The fact that staff are now there is \"unprecedented\", he added.\n\nCiting nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima, as well as the conflict in Iraq, he recalled that while agency inspectors had experienced \"difficult circumstances,\" it had always been in the aftermath.\n\n\"We in this case have the historical, ethical imperative to prevent something from happening. And by having established this presence, and by agreeing to a special safety and security protection zonewe have the opportunity to prevent this from happening.\"\n\nIAEA The Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in Ukraine.\n\nPlaying with fire\n\nThe mission report, published on Tuesday, provides concrete recommendations to address the seven pillars of nuclear safety that Mr. Grossi had outlined at the beginning of the war.\n\nAlthough the first pillar calls for not violating the physical integrity of nuclear facilities, \"this happened, and continues to happen,\" he said.\n\n\"The hits that this facility has received and that I could personally see and assess together with my experts is simply unacceptable. We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place,\" he warned.\n\nThe report proposes setting up a nuclear safety and security protection zone that would be limited to the perimeter and the plant itself.\n\nOther recommendations call for removing all military vehicles and equipment from nuclear buildings at the site and ensuring the return to clear and routine responsibilities for staff, in addition to re-establishing an \"appropriate\" work environment.",

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\n\"The day has come,\" Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) declared Monday, marking the beginning of his journey to the largest nuclear plant in Europe that sits on the fire line between the Russian occupiers and Ukrainian forces.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of 14 inspectors led by Grossi arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP) in southern Ukraine, despite concerns about constant shelling in the area.\n\nSince early March, when Russia captured the plant, international and local experts have voiced grave warnings, not only for the safety of the plants workers, but also for fear of a nuclear disaster that could affect thousands of people in the surrounding area.\n\nHeres a closer look at the perilous situation at the plant:\n\nThe significance of the plant\n\nUkraine relies heavily on nuclear power about half of its electricity comes from 15 nuclear reactors at four plants across the country, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n\nZaporizhzhia NPP, with six reactors, is the largest nuclear power station in Europe. It was mostly built in the Soviet era and became Ukrainian property after its declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nUntil recently, only two reactors were connected to Ukraines national grid and providing power, though the units have been taken offline at various points and for various reasons since the invasion.\n\nWhere is it and who controls it?\n\nZaporizhzhia NPP is located on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river in Ukraine. The area, and the nuclear complex, has been under Russian control since the beginning of the war, but the plant is still mostly operated by Ukrainian workers.\n\nAt the start of the invasion, Ukrainian forces stopped Russian forces from capturing a second nuclear facility the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant and forced them to retreat to Dnipro, according to Petro Kotin, president of Energoatom, which runs nuclear power plants in Ukraine. The frontline hasnt moved much in months.\n\nEach of Zaporizhzhias reactors would cost $7 billion to replace, making the plant a target for Russians to capture undamaged, with hopes of serving its own electricity market, according to analysis by defense and security intelligence firm Janes. Should Russia keep it, Ukraine would lose 20% of its domestic electricity generating capacity.\n\nWhat does its position on the frontline mean?\n\nShelling in the surrounding towns as well as near the power plant is common, according to local reports.\n\nUkraine has accused Russian forces of storing weaponry and launching attacks from the plant, knowing that Ukraine cant return fire without risking hitting the nuclear facility. Russia in turn claims Ukrainian forces are targeting the site.\n\nThe international community has been on high alert about nuclear safety, yet experts believe a Chernobyl-style disaster is unlikely. The plant is equipped with modern security systems, meaning even if there was neglect to its upkeep, or major military action caused serious damage, the result would be most comparable to the nuclear disaster in Fukushima which was contained locally, according to Janes and Energoatom.\n\nYet risks remain, one of which is potential damage to nuclear waste stored openly on site in ponds of water and in casks, according to Kotin from Energoatom.\n\nKotin has also warned that Russian attempts to switch the plant from the Ukrainian to the Russian power grid would require disconnecting all the reactors from power for a certain time, relying on emergency power generation never failing a \"very dangerous\" prospect, he told CNN in an August 22 interview.\n\nWhich parts of the plant have been affected by the conflict?\n\nThe plants main exclusion security zone, where the reactors and nuclear fuel are located, is surrounded by Dnipro waters to the northwest and Enerhodar town to the east.\n\nThe below satellite image highlights the plants facilities, which are vital to the accompanying timeline of events since the war began. They show just how narrowly Zaporizhzhia NPP has avoided a nuclear disaster.\n\nKey developments at the plant since the start of the war March 4, 2022 Russian troops take control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP), with operators working at \"gunpoint,\" according to Ukrainian nuclear officials. Russian shelling damages buildings around one nuclear reactor and Ukrainian authorities say a fire breaks out at a training center outside the main site. The UNs nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), condemns the move. Smoke rises from administrative buildings at Zaporizhzhia NPP on March 5, 2022.

March onwards Two out of six reactors in the plant are active. Meanwhile, the frontline along the River Dnipro that the plant stands on has moved little since early March. Kyiv has repeatedly accused Russian forces of storing heavy weaponry inside the complex and using it as cover to launch attacks.

The IAEA spent weeks negotiating a trip with Ukraine and Russia. July 19 A Ukrainian drone attack targets a Russian tent complex inside the plants main security exclusion zone, including a parked BM-21 Grad rocket launcher. The attack led to a fire but did not damage the reactors or fuel storage areas. Smoke billows upward as soldiers run out from tents on Zaporizhzhia NPP main site, Enerhodar, Ukraine. (Defense Intelligence of Ukraine) Aug. 5-6 Explosions reported near an electrical switchboard caused one reactor to shut down temporarily, the IAEA said. Separately, rockets hit roughly 30 to 60 feet from a dry storage facility holding casks of spent nuclear fuel, according to Energoatom. Ukraine and Russia continue to accuse each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia NPP in early August.

(Mary Altaffer/AP) Aug. 12 Ukrainian authorities say the Ukrainian-controlled towns of Nikopol and Marhanets, across the Dnipro River from the plant, have been attacked by Russian rocket fire for several nights in a row. Aug. 20-22 Shelling damages laboratory and chemical facilities inside the main plant complex and causes a temporary power cut-off from a backup thermal power station nearby, according to the IAEA, citing Ukrainian officials. Aug. 24 Kyiv says since March, three Ukrainian workers have been killed by the Russian military, and at least 26 others have been detained on accusations of leaking information. Aug. 25-26: Ukraine informs the IAEA that a power blackout disconnected all six reactors from the national grid for the first time in the plants history after the last remaining power line was damaged. By August 27, it had been repaired. A satellite image shows Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and fires nearby in Enerhodar on August 24.

(Dmytro Smolienko/Reuters) Sept. 1 After striking a hard-fought bargain with Ukrainian and Russian officials, a group of 14 international nuclear inspectors, including the IAEA head Rafael Grossi, arrives at the plant following a dangerous journey. Just hours before, Energoatom accused Russia of shelling the plant, which resulted in the fifth reactor shutting down and an activation of its emergency protection system.

(David 'Dee' Delgado/Reuters)\n\nThe UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has documented \"filtration\" cases, during which \"Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups have subjected persons to body searches, sometimes involving forced nudity, and detailed interrogations about the personal background, family ties, political views and allegiances of the individual concerned,\" according to Ilze Brands Kehris, United Nations assistant secretary-general for Human Rights.\n\n\"They examined personal belongings, including mobile devices, and gathered personal identity data, pictures and fingerprints. In some cases, those awaiting filtration spent nights in vehicles, or in unequipped and overcrowded premises, sometimes without adequate access to food, water and sanitation. We are particularly concerned that women and girls are at risk of sexual abuse during filtration procedures,\" Brands Kehris said.\n\nThe UN OHCHR has also documented cases of men and women \"perceived as having ties with Ukrainian armed forces or state institutions, or as having pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian views\" being subjected to torture, arbitrary detention, and \"enforced disappearance.\"\n\nThey were transferred to penal colonies, including the now infamous penal colony near Olenivka, and pre-trial detention centers, where they were interrogated and sometimes tortured to extract a so-called \"confession\" of their active cooperation with the government of Ukraine.\n\nSome detainees were released after one or two months, while others remain detained as of today, with no or little information for their families about their whereabouts and fate,\" Brands Kehris said.\n\nOver 6.9 million people remain internally displaced in Ukraine, with most of the newly-displaced coming from eastern and southern Ukraine. There have been 5,718 civilians killed, including 372 children, and 8,199 injured, 635 being children, during the war so far, Rosemary DiCarlo, UN under-secretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs, said Wednesday.\n\nDiCarlo added that \"these are only verified figures and the actual numbers are likely significantly higher.\"\n\nRussia denies forced \"filtration\" allegations: Refugees and displaced persons in Russia are given health and financial assistance, Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia said in his remarks to the UN Security Council Wednesday.\n\nHe said newcomers go through \"registration,\" not \"filtration\" procedures.\n\nIts very unfortunate that human rights groups are making unfounded allegations against Russia, Nebenzia said. \"We have wasted time\" discussing this issue rather than real issues, he said.\n\nNebenzia described the West's concerns as \"fantasies\" and said no one is preventing people from leaving Russia. Ukraine is moving people out, even if they are safe in the affected regions, he claimed. \"Kiev saboteurs\" are attacking areas where people want to leave, charged the ambassador.\n\n\"People are fleeing Ukraine, more for fear of Ukraine,\" Nebenzia said.",

Despite the controversies surrounding the impact of Western sanctions on Russian oil, the price cap could reduce Russian revenues and limit the impact of Russia's war on global energy prices, particularly for low and middle-income countries (6,9).

Russia could refuse to export oil at the lower price, potentially causing severe and lasting damage to its production capacity. Alternatively, Russia could continue to export oil to countries that refuse to abide by the G7 price cap, such as China and India (9). The strategy has also been criticized for potentially increasing Europe\u2019s import prices and creating a cycle of costlier imports and larger subsidies. Furthermore, the implementation of the price cap strategy could incentivize Russia to completely cut off energy supplies to the West, causing further turmoil in global energy markets and higher prices worldwide (5,10)."

Putin's threat to cut off energy supplies to the West, as a response to the European Union's price cap on Russian gas, could exacerbate the global energy crisis, leading to even higher prices (2). The Russian state-controlled gas giant Gazprom's CEO has warned that European gas prices could surge significantly if supplies are severed (2). Furthermore, Russia's decision to cut supplies could pose long-term costs on its oilfields, and the threat of this action could cause petroleum markets to rise (1).\n\nCountries implementing a price cap could suffer from energy shortages and face severe economic implications. Eastern and southern EU countries, in particular, could be heavily impacted by a cut-off (4). These disruptions could also contribute to global inflation and affect workers and businesses worldwide (6). Moreover, the halt of Russian oil supplies could deepen the concerns about a winter gas shortage and the prospect of a recession in Europe (7). Putin's hardline stance on the issue, warning that Russia will not supply anything that contradicts their interests, creates further uncertainty and tension in the global energy market (9)."

However, implementing this price cap is expected to be complex and would require a ban on services enabling maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally above the price cap (8). This move is part of a wider economic sanction strategy, which has yet to completely halt energy imports from Russia due to the potential catastrophic impact on EU countries, particularly Germany (5)."

Speaking at an event organized by Washington, DC-based think tank American Enterprise Institute,Zahawi said the primary reason he was in the US was \"to get this oil price gap over the line.\" Some background: Russia's government is making just as much money from energy exports as it was before its invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, inflation is surging globally. With price caps, barrels of Russian oil could theoretically still make their way onto the global market, thereby avoiding a further supply crunch but Moscow wouldn't be able to keep raking in hefty profits.",

Shortly after the G7 announcement, Russian state energy giant Gazprom said itwould not resume deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipelineon Saturday as planned. The company cited an oil leak, and didn't give a timeline of when the shipments might resume.",

                "cc_text": "To stop Kremlin from earning big from energy, the G7 countries have agreed on an oil price cap scheme. The aim is to incentivize Russian oil buyers to participate.\n\nSince the war in Ukraine began, a central target for Western governments has been to try and limit Russia's revenues from its energy exports.\n\nSanctions have had scant success in that regard. Higher-than-expected oil export volumes and rising gas prices have driven Russian energy revenues up. According to a Russian economy ministry document seen by Reuters, Moscow expects energy export volumes to surge by a massive 38% this year.\n\nThat's a major reason why late last week the G7 nations that's Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, as well as the European Union agreed to a Russian oil price cap, aimed at curbing the Kremlin's revenues.\n\nWhat is the plan?\n\nG7 countries have already placed embargoes on their own purchases of Russian oil, due to come into effect in the coming months in the case of the European Union. As a result, this plan targets key logistics services they control such as shipping and insurance which other countries need to buy Russian oil.\n\nThe oil cap plans will be implemented at the same time as the EU embargo takes effect. There will be two price caps, one for crude and one for refined products. The crude cap will apply from December 5 with refined products to follow from February 5, 2023.\n\nThe G7 says the aim is to prevent insurers and shipping companies from moving Russian seaborne crude and petroleum products unless they have been purchased at or below an unspecified price threshold.\n\nG7 countries control around 90% of the market for global shipping insurance. Russia requires a huge amount of vessels to export its oil and could struggle to find enough tankers to meet its needs if western insurers refused to cover its cargo.\n\nThe G7 says it wants the level of the price cap to be agreed upon in the near future by a \"broad coalition of countries.\" That may mean big energy consumers not in the G7, such as India and China. However, those countries have not yet given any indication that they will participate.\n\n\"The price cap is specifically designed to reduce Russian revenues and Russia's ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russia's war on global energy prices,\" G7 finance ministers said in a joint statement.\n\nThey added that the level of the price cap would be based on \"a range of technical inputs.\"\n\nHow will oil price cap work?\n\nThe US government was the big driver of the scheme. After the agreement was reached, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said: \"By committing to finalize and implement a price cap, the G7 will significantly reduce Russia's main source of funding for its illegal war, while maintaining supplies to global energy markets by keeping Russian oil flowing at lower prices.\"\n\nThat is the central goal of the plan to keep Russian oil flowing but at reduced prices, so as not to further drive up price inflation.\n\nThe idea is that lower- and middle-income countries that have not imposed Russian oil import bans will still be able to purchase Russian oil. However, they will be barred from using various insurance and shipping services if they exceed the price cap. The G7 hopes the fact that they can still purchase the oil will make them more likely to participate.\n\nWhat does Kremlin say?\n\nShortly before the price cap deal was announced, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said such a move would be an \"absurd decision\" and would lead to chaos in international oil markets.\n\nSurging energy export revenues have fueled the Russian war effort in Ukraine Image: Sergei Bobylev/TASS/dpa/picture alliance\n\nRussia says that it will not sell any oil to countries that participate in the oil cap plan. \"Companies that impose a price cap will not be among the recipients of Russian oil,\" Peskov said.\n\nOn the same day the deal was agreed, Russia announced it had cut gas supply to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline indefinitely. It blamed European sanctions for the move, saying it could not carry out urgent maintenance.\n\nWhat are the risks with the plan?\n\nThere is the chance that non-G7 countries will simply not sign up. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is among those who have been skeptical because of this. He said last month: \"You cannot do it unilaterally but only in close co-operation with many others. Otherwise, it will just come to nothing.\"\n\nWestern governments hope that even if countries don't sign up, buyers of Russian oil will expect lower prices because of the scheme. This could indirectly impact the Kremlin's earning power as a result.\n\nHowever, Russian oil is already a lot cheaper at present than many alternatives. That's a major reason why countries such as Indiahave suddenly become big purchasers of Russian oil in 2022. These countries could simply choose to continue purchasing Russian oil at the same or larger volumes.\n\nSupport from countries such as India may be needed for the oil cap plan to work Image: Pib Pho/Press Information Bureau/ZUMAPRESS.com/picture alliance\n\nAnother possibility is that Russia will export less oil to try and drive up global prices, in much the same way it has done with its gas supply to Europe. However, that itself carries risks for Moscow. A substantial reduction of its production can harm its reservoirs and cut its capacity in the longer term.\n\nPerhaps the key area of concern is enforcement. With the details of the plan not yet revealed, there is uncertainty over how exactly the G7 will enforce the price cap plan. Shipping insurers have already expressed concern that they could be responsible for checking what price the oil they are scheduled to carry traded at.\n\nThe ultimate viability of the plan will depend on the small details.\n\nEdited by: Ashutosh Pandey",

The public would probably trust us more if we had taken those measures in May.\"\n\nLast weekend, an estimated 70,000 people protested in Prague against the Czech government, calling on the ruling coalition to do more to control soaring energy prices and voicing opposition to the EU and NATO.\n\nTens of thousands protest in Prague against Czech government, EU and NATO An estimated 70,000 people protested in Prague against the Czech government on Saturday (3 September), calling on the ruling coalition to do more to control soaring energy prices and voicing opposition to the European Union and NATO.\n\nEU energy ministers will discuss the measures laid out by the Commission at an emergency meeting on Friday (9 September).\n\nUnless tangible results come out quickly, \"a year from now there will be less than half of the ministers from the Council tomorrow at the table again,\" warned the energy advisor.\n\nDiplomats said the European Commission has been tone deaf in preparations for todays meeting, and sought to delay it until the end of September, a full month after it was convened by Czechia, which holds the EUs rotating presidency. The reason for seeking a delay was because EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson was travelling to India this week.\n\nCriticisms about the Commissions handling of the crisis have also come from industry.\n\nSanjeev Kumar from the European Geothermal Energy Council told EURACTIV that Europe should have learnt from the success of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and prioritised cross-EU purchasing of renewable energy and energy efficiency technology early this year.\n\n\"The rhetoric has been quick. But the actual hard and fast actions have been far too slow,\" he said.\n\nAsked by EURACTIV about these criticisms, the European Commission pointed to comments made by its chief spokesperson Eric Mamer on Monday (5 September).\n\n\"I believe that we are firmly on track and, once again, that what we will put on the table for the discussion will be all the more helpful because we have taken the time to analyse all the different dimensions of this issue,\" the chief spokesperson said.\n\nSome also support the Commission in taking the time to do an in-depth analysis of the emergency measures given the complexity of the energy market.\n\n\"We have to consider not only the possible positive implications in the social and economic dimension by the proposed price caps, but also think of the market outcomes that are most likely to happen,\" European Peoples Party lawmaker Christian Ehler told EURACTIV.\n\nEU chief lays out five measures to tackle energy crisis Brussels outlined on Wednesday (7 September) five proposals to tackle the high energy prices gripping Europe, including a mandatory target for reducing electricity use, capping the revenues of energy firms, and recycling the money raised to help vulnerable households.\n\nEU countries split on crisis measures\n\nDespite the pressure on EU capitals, energy ministers are not expected to make final decisions on Friday as the European Commission has yet to table formal legislative proposals.\n\n\"We have issued a non-paper, which sets out the basic ideas that we want to carry through,\" said Eric Mamer, the European Commissions chief spokesperson.\n\n\"A very important step will come tomorrow with the Energy Council, during which we will have an opportunity to discuss with ministers before we finalise our proposals,\" he told a regular press briefing on Thursday (8 September).\n\nEU countries still differ in their recommended approaches to the crisis, diplomats said.\n\nWhile coordinated measures would strengthen the EUs position towards Russia and avoid disruptions to the EU market, Europe needs to act carefully because countries have different energy mixes, a senior diplomat explained.\n\nFinland, Sweden and Denmark have already thrown their weight behind the EU executives plan, with a joint letter to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen from the countries prime ministers on Wednesday (7 September).\n\nSeveral other countries have said they are open-minded about the options but are also cautious about making major changes to Europes energy market without proper analysis and the assurance that it will not derail EU climate goals.\n\nAnd, while a large group of capitals are favourable to capping gas prices, there is disagreement on how to implement such a measure at EU level.\n\nThe European Commission favours putting a price cap on Russian gas only, while Italy and Belgium say it should apply to all gas imported into Europe.\n\nOthers are opposed to a price cap on Russian gas because of the possible repercussions, an EU diplomat said. Russia has threatened to stop supplying energy to Europe if a price cap comes into force and there is concern among eastern and southern EU countries, which would be particularly affected by a cut-off.\n\nVienna said it would not agree to the proposal because it could jeopardise security of supply.\n\nProposals due next week\n\nThe next step after todays ministerial is for the Commission to come up with formal legislative proposals, presumably on Tuesday (13 September).\n\n\"We will table the proposal probably next Tuesday, depending on progress, and ministers tomorrow will not decide anything either,\" Mamer said.\n\nThe quickest way to get the proposals through would be to use emergency Council Regulations, similar to the demand reduction target for gas, which were adopted in less than a week at the end of July.\n\nThis would only require a qualified majority of EU countries to pass the measures.\n\nHowever, some are questioning whether the Commissions proposed price cap on Russian gas could be seen as a sanction, which would require unanimity. Hungary, for one, opposed the demand reduction target in July and may not want to jeapordise its cheap Russian gas contracts.\n\n[Edited by Frdric Simon]\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

Yellen released the following statement on the G7 Finance Ministers agreement to finalize and implement a cap on the price of Russian oil.\n\n\"Today, the G7 took a critical step forward in achieving our dual goals of putting downward pressure on global energy prices while denying Putin revenue to fund his brutal war in Ukraine. By committing to finalize and implement a price cap, the G7 will significantly reduce Russias main source of funding for its illegal war, while maintaining supplies to global energy markets by keeping Russian oil flowing at lower prices. While weve seen energy prices ease in the United States, energy costs remain a concern for Americans and continue to be elevated globally. This price cap is one of the most powerful tools we have to fight inflation and protect workers and businesses in the United States and globally from future price spikes caused by global disruptions.\n\nTodays action will help deliver a major blow for Russian finances and will both hinder Russias ability to fight its unprovoked war in Ukraine and hasten the deterioration of the Russian economy. We have already begun to see the impact of the price cap through Russias hurried attempts to negotiate bilateral oil trades at massive discounts.\n\nI look forward to working with our G7 allies as well as new coalition partners as we move quickly to finalize the implementation of the price cap in the weeks to come.\"\n\n###",

                "cc_text": "The G7 governments have a problem. The war in Ukraine against Russia is not won. It looks set to be a long grinding conflict, possibly with no end. And yet the world and particularly Europe depends on Russian energy supplies. The G7 has agreed to stop buying Russian oil, as part of its programme of using economics sanctions as a war weapon. But up to now, energy imports from Russia have not been stopped because it would mean a catastrophe for the EU countries, particularly Germany. And Russia is still selling huge volumesglobally albeit at a discount from the world priceto India, China and other energy-thirsty economies.\n\nAt the beginning of June, the European Union agreed to bar its companies from \"insuring and financing the transport, in particular, through maritime routes, of [Russian] oil to third parties\" after the end of 2022 to make it \"difficult for Russia to continue exporting its crude oil and petroleum products to the rest of the world.\" But that is still not being implemented and Greek-owned tankers are delivering Russian oil exports across the globe and until this week, Russian gas was still being imported into Europe. As a result, the Russian trade surplus has rocketed as oil and gas export revenues rise, driven mainly by huge price increases.\n\nIn a mirror image, the Eurozone trade balance Trade balance The trade balance of a country is the difference between merchandize sold (exports) and merchandize bought (imports). The resulting trade balance either shows a deficit or is in credit. has sunk into a severe deficit and the euro has slumped in value below the dollar for the first time in over 20 years.\n\nEuropean governments have been desperately trying to find alternative sources of energy supply and have shopped around the world to buy gas and oil at going market prices. This has led to spiralling natural gas and oil prices. However, at great expense, Europe has been building up its gas storage to get through the coming winter. Gas storage levels are now at 80%of capacity and even higher in Germany.\n\nThis has been done by switching to expensive liquid natural gas (LNG) imports brought in by ships. Europe has reduced its gas imports from Russia (partly by policy but mainly because Russia has cut gas supplies down to 20% in the key pipeline and now this week to zero). To replace that loss, it has bought LNG from Spain and North America.\n\nEven so, it will have to use up all its storage capacity to get through the winter without electricity cuts. And then what?\n\nThats why the G7 leaders have decided on a new sanction against Russia which they hope will speed up Russian capitulation on the war in Ukraine. Led by Janet Yellen, the US Treasury Secretary, they propose to introduce a price cap on all oil imports from Russia. Instead of applying a blanket ban on insuring or financing any Russian oil shipments, credit and insurance will be made available, as long as the price paid for Russian energy is below a certain level.\n\nWhat level is still to be decided for the new year 2023. Currently the Brent crude oil price is about $90-100/barrel. So if the price cap were fixed at, say, $50/b, then Russian export revenues would presumably plummet and so Putin would lose funding for his war, while energy prices would drop sharply. Indeed, on this news gas and oil prices have dropped back, although they are still four times higher (gas) and 80% higher (oil) than before the war started.\n\nWill this price cap weapon work? There are many holes in it. Russia could refuse to export oil at the lower price, though that would not only reduce one of its few sources of external revenue, it also would require shutting down oil wells that arent easily restarted. An extended shutdown of Russian oil wells could do severe and lasting damage to its production capacity. But Russia could continue to export oil to countries that refuse to abide by the G7 price cap, eg China and India. Indeed, before the invasion, India imported almost no Russian oil. By July it was importing close to 1mn b/d of Russian crude (heavily discounted), or about 1 percent of global supply. And then all countries must agree to use G7 insurance facilities and not resort to those outside their restrictions. Many countries may not follow the G7 strictures.\n\nMeanwhile, the huge rises in global energy (and food) prices are creating a cost of living catastrophe. Everywhere in Europe, real wages are crashing.\n\nIts worst of all in Britain. The Bank of England (BoE) forecasts the inflation Inflation The cumulated rise of prices as a whole (e.g. a rise in the price of petroleum, eventually leading to a rise in salaries, then to the rise of other prices, etc.). Inflation implies a fall in the value of money since, as time goes by, larger sums are required to purchase particular items. This is the reason why corporate-driven policies seek to keep inflation down. rate to peak at 13.3% in October and real household disposable income is set to fall by 3.7% across 2022 and 2023, making those two years the worst on record. But it may be even worse than that. Citibank forecasts inflation is on course to rise to 18.6 per cent in January, the highest peak in almost half a century, due to soaring wholesale gas prices. And Goldman Sachs goes further as it expects even larger gas rises, and now expects UK inflation to peak at 22%!\n\nAs always, its the poor that take hardest hit. Over 40% of UK households will not be able to heat their homes properly in January when energy bills rise yet again. Yes, this Britain in 2022. About 28mn people in 12mn homes, or 42 per cent of all households, will not be able to afford to adequately heat and power their properties from January, when a typical yearly energy bill is forecast to exceed 5,300. Even by October, when Britains energy price cap will rise 80 per cent to 3,549 9m households will face fuel poverty. With the current cost-of-living crisis being felt hardest by low-income households, absolute poverty is on track to rise by three million over the next two years), while relative child poverty is projected to reach its highest level (33% in 2026-27) since the peaks of the 1990s.\n\nBut what is this energy price cap that is applied in the UK? Supposedly it is to stop energy companies hiking their bills too much and making super-profits at the expense of households. In the UK, a regulator called Ofgem sets a price cap every six months that supposedly regulates the profitability of the privatized energy retail companies that charge customers for gas and electricity.\n\nBut this price cap has rocketed from under 1000 a year in 2021 to 3549 in October and then is forecast to reach an eye-watering 6600 by summer next year. These sorts of rises are completely impossible for average households and small companies to absorb, let alone the poorest and those with uninsulated homes.\n\nHow can these price rises be explained? Much is made of the profits being made by the retail energy monopolies and it is true that they are making big profits and distributing millions to their shareholders. But when you look at the breakdown of the costs for these retailers it tells a deeper story.\n\nWhat you find is that the energy retail companies are restricted by Ofgem to just a 2% profit Profit The positive gain yielded from a companys activity. Net profit is profit after tax. Distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders. rate on (total, not operating) costs. But those costs include the costs of getting the gas and electricity distributed down the pipes and lines to households. The suppliers of these services are a separate bunch of monopolies (in the UK, the Big Six). The Big Six can charge up to a 40% profit rate in their prices to the retail companies and so take up about 7-10% of the price to the householder. The distribution companies are owned by various hedge funds Hedge funds Unlisted investment funds that exist for purposes of speculation and that seek high returns, make liberal use of derivatives, especially options, and frequently make use of leverage. The main hedge funds are independent of banks, although banks frequently have their own hedge funds. Hedge funds come under the category of shadow banking. and private equity Equity The capital put into an enterprise by the shareholders. Not to be confused with hard capital or unsecured debt. companies who take their cut.\n\nBut the biggest part of the household bill is the price charged by the global energy companies for their gas and oil ie the likes of Shell, BP, Mobil, Exxon etc.\n\nThis is where the real profits bonanza is. The profits bonanza in the second quarter included a record $11.5bn profit for BPs rival Shell, record profits of $17.6bn and $11.6bn respectively for the USs ExxonMobil and Chevron, plus $9.8bn for Frances Total. In the first six months of the year the companies made combined adjusted profits of nearly $100bn.\n\nSo when the head of the UKs Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley says that \"We cant force companies to buy energy for less than the price we all need to work together\", in a way, he is right. If the market rules, then his regulatory powers can do little because he works on the principle that companies must make a profit. But if the goal of Ofgem is to ensure a fair deal for households in conditions of natural monopoly, then it has clearly failed in this mandate. The privatisation of gas and electricity distribution in the UK since the late 1980s and early 1990s has resulted in a handful of very large and very powerful firms enjoying large profit margins with shareholders reaping big dividends, while UK households are subjected to sky-high energy bills.\n\nFor example, the big six distributors have paid out almost 23 billion in dividends, six times their tax bill in the last ten years. But then as one CEO said, \"Businesses are there to make a profit, and dividends are one way of sharing that with shareholders\".\n\nThe powers-that-be are also shocked by the energy price explosion. Indeed, several have put into question the economic principle of market pricing, calling it \"frankly ludicrous\" (Boris Johnson), [1] \"absurd\" (Emmanuel Macron), [2] and concluding that \"this market system does not work anymore\" (Ursula von der Leyen). The EU chief admitted that this was\"exposing the limitations of our current electricity market design\". But whats the answer? Well, \"we need a new market model for electricity that really functions\" (!). \"Alternative market designs that could potentially include the decoupling of gas from the formation of the market price\". So gas prices would be controlled and not subject to the market but how?\n\nI wont go further into the myriad of proposals coming from the UK government, the opposition Labour party and various think-tanks about how to relieve or avoid the catastrophe ahead for millions of households in Europe and particularly the UK. I wont because there is one thing that they all have in common there are no proposals to end the market for energy prices or to bring into common ownership the energy companies, retail, distribution and wholesale (the UK TUC proposes nationalization of retail only). To do so would require a revolutionary transformation of the structure of economies starting with energy.\n\nAnd yet even on a limited scale, public ownership of energy works. In Germany, for instance, two-thirds of all electricity is purchased from municipally owned energy companies and, since 2016, the Munich city council has supplied enough renewable energy for the needs of every household. Denmark has a fully publicly owned transmission grid, and the highest proportion of wind power in the world. A publicly owned energy system can be complemented by smaller-scale developments, like community-owned energy. In 2008, the isle of Eigg was the first community to launch an off-grid electric system powered by wind, water and solar, allowing local people to have a greater stake and say in their energy.\n\nBut these steps are limited and partial. Overall, the market rules and Big Oil runs the show. And now market pricing is being aggravated by the desperate attempts of the G7 leaders to defeat Russia in the war.\n\nAs a result, efforts to control carbon emissions and meet global targets are being reversed as fossil fuel energy production is accelerated and fossil fuel subsidies to help control energy prices are increased. Energy tax subsidies not only enforce the EUs reliance on fossil fuel imports but also work against achieving the climate targets of the European Green Deal.\n\nIn the US, coal-fired power generation was higher in 2021 under President Joe Biden than it was in 2019 under then President Donald Trump, who had positioned himself as the would-be saviour of Americas coal industry. In Europe, coal power rose 18 per cent in 2021, its first increase in almost a decade.\n\nEconomist Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford university, says the shift away from fossil fuels has rarely looked more complicated. \"The energy transition was already in trouble 80 per cent of the worlds energy is still from fossil fuels,\" he said. \"I expect that in the short term, the US will increase oil and gas output and EU coal consumption could increase\".\n\nThere is no escaping from the obvious conclusion. To avoid the energy catastrophe and reverse the huge loss in living standards already under way, we need to take over the fossil fuel companies and phase out their production with increased investment in renewables, to reduce fuel prices for households and small businesses.\n\nBut that means a global plan to steer investments into things society does need, like renewable energy, organic farming, public transportation, public water systems, ecological remediation, public health, quality schools and other currently unmet needs. Such a plan could also equalize development the world over by shifting resources out of useless and harmful production in the North and into developing the South, building basic infrastructure, sanitation systems, public schools, health care. At the same time, a global plan could aim to provide equivalent jobs for workers displaced by the retrenchment or closure of unnecessary or harmful industries.\n\nFat chance of that now. Instead, millions face a cost of living crisis of record proportions. And dont forget the prospect of new global slump in production, investment and employment. According to the IMF IMF\n\nInternational Monetary Fund Along with the World Bank, the IMF was founded on the day the Bretton Woods Agreements were signed. Its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates.\n\nWhen the Bretton Wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971, the main function of the IMF became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital: it acts as policeman when it enforces its Structural Adjustment Policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments.\n\nAs for the World Bank, a weighted voting system operates: depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state. 85% of the votes is required to modify the IMF Charter (which means that the USA with 17,68% % of the votes has a de facto veto on any change).\n\nThe institution is dominated by five countries: the United States (16,74%), Japan (6,23%), Germany (5,81%), France (4,29%) and the UK (4,29%).\n\nThe other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country. The most important one (6,57% of the votes) is led by Belgium. The least important group of countries (1,55% of the votes) is led by Gabon and brings together African countries.\n\nhttp://imf.org , real GDP GDP\n\nGross Domestic Product Gross Domestic Product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added. The measure is notoriously incomplete; for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange. The GDP takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services. Economic growth is defined as the variation of the GDP from one period to another. in the G20 G20 The Group of Twenty (G20 or G-20) is a group made up of nineteen countries and the European Union whose ministers, central-bank directors and heads of state meet regularly. It was created in 1999 after the series of financial crises in the 1990s. Its aim is to encourage international consultation on the principle of broadening dialogue in keeping with the growing economic importance of a certain number of countries. Its members are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, USA, UK and the European Union (represented by the presidents of the Council and of the European Central Bank). countries (or more exactly 18 top economies exc Saudi Arabia) fell in Q2 2022. But the inflation rate continued to rise.\n\nAnd the IMF notes, \"The global outlook has already darkened significantly since April. The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one.\" Jacon Frenkel, head of the Group of 30 consortium of global policy makers summed it up: \"We have the energy crisis, we have the food crisis, we have the supply chain crisis and we have the war, all of which has profound implications for the economic performance of the world.",

                "cc_text": "China and India hold the key to the success, or failure, of a price cap on Russian oil proposed by the G7. Asia's largest oil consumers are expected to buy even more cheap Russian crude if the US-led coalition's attempt to starve President Vladimir Putin of oil earnings to fund its war in Ukraine plays out.\n\nBut the market remains divided over whether the latest efforts to hurt Russia financially will fall flat or even backfire, accelerating a potential global recession.\n\nFar from expecting China and India to join the G7 price cap alliance, the US hopes the price cap will expand the discount for Russian crudes on the global market giving Asian refiners additional leverage to negotiate down prices in supply talks with Russia.\n\nCheapening the value of Russia's oil exports rather than stemming their flow to world markets has become the West's key priority.\n\nRussian crude exports remain close to pre-war levels and the value of its oil has been recovering in recent weeks due to tight markets for physical barrels. At the start of the summer, Europe's remaining buyers of Urals crude enjoyed discounts of up to $40/b vs Dated Brent. Although still well below the pre-war discount for Russia's key export grade to Brent of $2.5/b in January, they have halved to a $20/b discount since early August, data from S&P Global Commodity Insights shows.\n\nSupported by strong Chinese and Indian demand, Eastern Russia's ESPO crude blend has seen its discount to Dubai crude shrink from $25/b in July to around $5/b in early September, according to the IEA.\n\n\"Regardless of which options the countries take, the price cap helps us achieve our objectives by putting downward pressure on the cost of Russian oil exports,\" the US Treasury Department's Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Ben Harris said Sept. 9. \"Ultimately, we believe the price cap would be successful in our goal of substantially hurting Russia's main source of revenue.\"\n\nBalancing act\n\nAs it stands, the cap mechanism requires two key elements to get it off the ground coordinating a ban on providing insurance services needed to ship Russian oil above a certain price and setting that price ceiling below current market values but above the cost of production.\n\nToo low and the price cap could trigger Russian retaliation by shutting in swathes of oil production that will boost global crude prices, further fuel inflation and deepen the world's energy crisis. Too high and Russia will continue to benefit from redirecting its oil away from Europe at current prices.\n\n\"The most critical issue is the level of the price cap,\" said Ehsan Khoman, MUFG's EMEA head of emerging markets research, \"Set it at zero and it's akin to an embargo as Russia will not sell its oil for free but set it at market prices then its novelty is quite trivial.\"\n\nPutin has already said he would halt all oil exports to countries imposing a price cap. That would mean Russia attempting to redirect even more oil exports to its key trading allies China, India and Turkey.\n\nRelated content\n\nNon-G7 nations to benefit without applying Russian oil price cap: US Treasury\n\nPrice cap on Russian oil may lower discounts, widen buyer pool: Vitol's Muller\n\nThe G7 appears to be banking on Russia redirecting more oil flows to Asia rather than retaliating by shutting in production. With Russia's energy exports normally funding more than half of Russia's government budget, the US believes Putin will be loath to simply turning off the spigots and should opt to absorb a bigger discount for his oil.\n\n\"The price cap is greater than marginal costs of production for Russia so there is a clear economic incentive for Russia to continue to produce oil and sell it,\" US Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes Elizabeth Rosenberg said.\n\nCircumvention risk\n\nThe main lever to implement the price cap is the ability to control global shipping insurance, which some detractors note, provides ample opportunity for less scrupulous importers to sidestep the G7 imitative.\n\nBut with more than 95% of the global oil tanker fleet covered by shipping insurers in G7 countries, it's unclear if refiners would risk using potentially inferior Russian alternatives to the global insurance standard.\n\nOthers note that widespread ship-to-ship transfers of Russian oil to evade sanctions could still undermine the scheme in the same way that sea transfers helped support Russian exports near pre-war levels since March.\n\nBut Rosenberg believes that shipping insurance will be a tougher hurdle to overcome.\n\n\"The oil price cap policy will be applied to cargoes of Russian oil and refined products no matter how many times the cargoes have moved from ship to ship, or transshipped from an initial purchaser to another as long as the cargoes are on the water,\" Rosenberg said. It is still possible for countries to work entirely outside of the oil price cap, using services outside the G7 price cap coalition but it might be \"economically difficult\" to do so, she added.\n\nTrade constraints\n\nRussia also faces major infrastructure and logistical costs to divert oil flowing to Europe to other customers. A market where Russia diverts some 3 million b/d of crude and products from Europe to Asia, for example, would stretch tanker availability due to the longer voyages. Tanker voyages from Russia's Baltic ports to Asia take more than twice as long as cargoes loading from the Persian Gulf where most Asian supply originates.\n\nThe ability of refiners in China and India to substitute increasing volumes of Middle East crude with Urals may also limit the amount of oil that Russia can send to the East. Russian crude exports to India and China have already more than doubled from pre-war levels to 2 million b/d and not all plants will want to process higher rates of Russian crude.\n\nAt the same time, China's domestic oil demand is also under threat due to recurring COVID-19-related lockdowns. Platts Analytics predicts Chinese oil demand will contract for the first time in decades this year, by 95,000 b/d or 0.6%.\n\nSome oil supply losses from Russia are seen as likely even if EU reworks its existing sanctions to incorporate the price cap mechanism before year-end. Platts Analytics forecasts Russian disruptions peaking at 1.5 million b/d in Q1 2023 due to the EU import bans which could be \"tempered\" by the price cap.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates that the world can still expect to lose about 1 million b/d of Russian supply versus pre-war levels due to incomplete redirection to alternative non-NATO buyers under a price cap.\n\nDone right, the price cap mechanism could drive down Russia's energy revenues and avoid a recession-triggering surge in global oil prices. If Russia decides to bite the bullet and shut in swathes of production in retaliation the additional pain will be shared globally.",

This part of the document was reported by Bloomberg on 5 September, although the details of the potential impact on the energy sector have not been previously reported.\n\nIf Europe refused Russian gas, it would lead to a potential reduction in gas exports of more than 100 billion cubic metres a year by 2027, almost half of total exports in 2021, according to the document.\n\nAs a result, investment in the gas sector over 8 years to 2030 would fall by the equivalent of around $41 billion.\n\nThe Kremlin said it had nothing to add to Putins comments.\n\nPutins energy cards\n\nSelling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources for Russian foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War Two.\n\nAnd since Boris Yeltsin handed Putin the nuclear codes on the last day of 1999, the former KGB spy has sought to use his energy aces to claw back some of the clout Russia lost when the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991.\n\nLocked into a confrontation with the West over Ukraine, Putin is playing his energy cards again, a lever which Moscow can use against a US-dominated global financial system.\n\nHe says that Russia had gained, not lost, from the conflict because it was embarking on a new path.\n\nPutin, who turns 70 in October, has repeatedly said that if Europe does not want to buy Russian oil and gas, or if it tries to cap prices, then Russia will redirect its vast supplies in a major tilt towards Asian powers such as China and India.\n\nBut to do so, Russia would need to accelerate the construction of its pipelines eastwards, the document said.\n\n\"Power of Siberia 1\" is the only major Russian gas pipeline to China. It is expected to deliver 16 billion cubic metres in 2022, 11% of what Russia usually exports to Europe each year.\n\nAnd \"Power of Siberia 2\" to China, from the Bovanenkovo and Kharasavey gas fields in Yamal, is yet to be completed.\n\nEnergy superpower?\n\nIf Europe can find alternatives to Russian energy, Moscow faces considerable challenges.\n\n\"In the most negative scenario, it is expected that by 2027, European countries will be able to completely abandon Russian oil,\" the document said, with the Druzhba oil pipeline and Baltic ports hit badly.\n\nDruzhba, which means \"friendship\" in Russian, pumped 36 million tons of oil last year, while Baltic ports handled 60-80 million tons of crude oil annually in 2019-2021.\n\n\"The old challenges associated with the rise in the cost of production as a result of the complication of oil extraction and the increase in the share of hard-to-recover reserves will be complemented by the increasing costs of reorienting export flows and increased demand for the tanker fleet,\" it said.\n\nIsolated from Western technology, the Russian energy sector would face hard choices, especially when it comes to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), oil and oil refining.\n\n\"The withdrawal of technological partners from LNG production projects will shift the timing of the commissioning of new capacities,\" the document said.\n\nAs Russia rushes to adjust, there could be a reduction in exports of oil products by almost 55% to 2021 levels, or by 80 million tons, which in turn would lead to a drop in refining by 25-30% and difficulties in ensuring sufficient gasoline production for the domestic market, leading to rising fuel prices, the document said.\n\nAnd while Gazprom has been doing well in recent months, with a record 2.5 trillion roubles in profit in the first six months of 2022, it faces tough longer-term choices.\n\nWith about 15% of global and 68% of Russian gas reserves, the worlds biggest natural gas company by reserves, may have to freeze wells or flare gas, analysts said.\n\nGazprom did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

The minuscule boost was widely interpreted as a rebuff to U.S. President Joe Biden after his visit to Saudi Arabia to ask the OPEC kingpin to pump more to cool prices and help the global economy.\n\n\"The President has taken action including historic release of oil from U.S. and global strategic reserves and working with allies on a price cap on Russian oil to ensure we maintain a global supply of oil, even as we punish Putin for his action,\" said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nOPEC+ said in a statement that Monday's decision to revert back to August levels of production was because the upward adjustment was \"intended only for the month of September.\"\n\nThe next OPEC+ meeting is scheduled for Oct. 5.\n\nOil prices traded sharply higher but were off the day's highs on Monday afternoon. International benchmark Brent crude futures were up 2.5% at $95.54 a barrel at around 1 p.m. ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 2.6% at $89.16 a barrel.\n\nOil prices have fallen around 25% since early June after touching multiyear highs in March. The decline has been fueled by growing concerns that interest rate hikes and Covid-related restrictions in parts of China could slow global economic growth and curtail oil demand.\n\nMonday's announcement from OPEC+ comes amid a bitter and escalating energy dispute between Russia and the West, with many in Europe deeply concerned about the prospect of recession and a winter gas shortage.\n\nMeanwhile, market participants are closely monitoring the prospect of a supply boost from Iranian crude if Tehran can secure a renewed version of the 2015 nuclear deal.",

However, it acknowledges that creating regional pricing zones is more challenging to implement and \"would require significant regulatory and technical complex preparations\".\n\nThierry Bros, a Professor at Sciences Po Paris and contributor to Natural Gas World, derided the price cap idea, saying it will be useless once Russian gas exports to Europe drop to zero.\n\nRegarding the creation of different pricing zones, he believes the idea has little chance of finding support among EU countries other than Germany.\n\n\"The concept of a price cap between green and red zones is for me going back to Soviet times,\" he told EURACTIV. \"This is going to be a major market disruption with little positive outcome,\" he said.\n\nThe first option imposing a price cap on Russian gas only appears to find more traction in Brussels, even though it is likely to escalate tensions with Moscow.\n\nOn Friday, Gazprom announced an indefinite shutdown of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany officially for technical reasons , deepening Europes difficulties in securing fuel for the winter. The move came just hours after G7 countries agreed a price cap on Russian oil.\n\n\"I firmly believe that it is now time for a price cap on Russian pipeline gas to Europe,\" Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, said on Friday (2 September).\n\n\"A gas price cap can be proposed at European level, and there also is a legal foundation at European level to skim profits temporarily as an emergency measure at a time of crisis,\" she told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of German conservative lawmakers in the town of Murnau.\n\nOptions\n\nImposing a price cap on Russian gas is not without risk, however, with Moscow likely to retaliate by completely shutting down exports to Europe, the paper warns.\n\nIt should therefore be understood \"as a quasi-sanction measure against Russia,\" the document adds, saying EU countries should be ready to \"lock-in\" their decision and avoid backing down even \"in the event of Russian threats to completely stop the gas supplies to the EU as a result\".\n\nThe EU can \"anticipate and mitigate the impact of a complete embargo\" on Russian gas by \"stimulating curtailment and demand reduction\" measures, the paper continues, referring to a \"winter preparedness\" plan presented by the European Commission in July, which outlines a possible set of measures.\n\nImplementing those measures \"would make a gas embargo more bearable for the EU, consequently strengthening the EU position in imposing a price cap,\" the paper argues.\n\nBrussels lays out EU gas crisis plan ahead of coming winter The European Commission proposed on Wednesday (20 July) introducing a new target for EU countries to temporarily reduce by 15% their gas consumption, with the possibility of the goal becoming legally binding in case of emergency.\n\nPrice caps on consumer prices\n\nSeveral EU countries have also introduced retail price caps or subsidies to lower consumer energy bills, something the Commission paper does not address in detail.\n\nBut those have fierce detractors. If implemented indiscriminately, they risk triggering \"a never-ending spiral of higher import prices and higher subsidies,\" warns Daniel Gros, an economist at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) in Brussels.\n\n\"Instead of subsidising consumption through a price cap, governments should subsidise gas savings, for example, by paying households for consuming less this winter than last winter,\" he wrote in an opinion piece for EURACTIV.\n\nVon der Leyen seemed to acknowledge this, saying EU governments could skim off some of the windfall profits that electricity suppliers have made from the gas crisis and use the money to support vulnerable citizens and companies.\n\nShe will outline the Commissions ideas for emergency EU measures on 14 September, a senior commission official said on Thursday.\n\nRead the full paper below or click here to download.

They also agreed that OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia could call an extraordinary meeting anytime if volatility persists.\n\nThe decision essentially maintains the status quo as OPEC has been observing wild fluctuations in oil prices.\n\n\"OPEC+ is wary of protracted price volatility generated by weak macro sentiment, thin liquidity and renewed China lockdowns, as well as uncertainty over a potential U.S.Iran deal and efforts to create a Russian oil price cap,\" said Matthew Holland at Energy Aspects.\n\nTop OPEC producer Saudi Arabia last month flagged the possibility of output cuts to address what it sees as exaggerated oil price movements.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude oil LCOc1 has dropped to about $95 a barrel from $120 in June on fears of an economic slowdown and recession in the West.\n\nRussia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday the OPEC+ oil output cut was merely a reflection of expectations of a weaker global economic growth.\n\nOil prices have been also dragged down by a potential supply boost from Iranian crude returning to the market if Tehran is able to revive its 2015 nuclear deal with global powers.\n\n\"The political angle, it seems, is a Saudi message to the U.S. about the revival of the Iranian nuclear agreement ... It is hard to interpret the decision as anything but price supportive,\" said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.\n\nIran is expected to add 1 million bpd to supply, or 1% of global demand, if sanctions are eased, though the prospects for a nuclear deal looked less clear on Friday.\n\nThe White House said on Monday U.S. President Joe Biden was committed to take all steps necessary to shore up energy supplies and lower prices. R\n\n\"The cut suggests that there is a desire to defend oil prices to stay above the level of $90 per barrel,\" said Giovanni Staunovo at UBS.\n\nRaad AlKadiri at Eurasia Group said: \"It is a signal of intent ... The decision to cut reinforces that 'do not take us for granted' message without doing anything drastic.\"\n\nSignals from the physical market, however, suggest supply remains tight and many OPEC states are producing below targets while fresh Western sanctions are threatening Russian exports.\n\nRussia has said it will stop supplying oil to countries that support the idea of capping the price of Russian energy supplies over its military conflict in Ukraine.\n\nRussia's gas deliveries in Europe, meanwhile, have been cut further, which is likely to spark more price spikes.\n\n\"An output cut won't make them any friends at a time when the world is facing a cost-of-living crisis,\" said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam.",

Such actions will backfire on G7 countries much as all previous sanctions have,\" Rasmussen said.\n\nOver the past several months, the sanctions imposed by the collective West on Russia in retaliation for its military operation in Ukraine have sent food and energy prices soaring, triggering record-high inflation in many countries.\n\nRasmussen said the decision continues the \"self-destruction and economic suicide currently underway.\"\n\nImposing a price cap simply may eliminate oil supplies from Russia to the West, while Moscow will be able to easily find new clients in other regions unless G7 plans to impose secondary sanctions on those countries who will follow general market rules, he noted.\n\n\"Such use of secondary sanctions will further compromise the global energy market. Hence, the availability of Russian oil will be reduced to G7 nations thus causing further price increases in the global oil market and aggravating the energy crises even more,\" Rasmussen said.\n\nThe United States will not get benefits from this situation unless it increases its own oil exploration, the expert said.\n\n\"Moreover, with the US being the leading proponent of such insane and totalitarian actions this could lead to further political and economic challenges resulting in a potential fragmentation of European allies,\" he warned.\n\nThe price ceiling will take effect on December 5 for crude oil and on February 5, 2023, for refined products coming from Russia. The European Commission has already said that it would also make efforts to impose a price cap on Russia's oil by December following the G7 decision.\n\nOn September 1, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak condemned the idea of imposing a price cap on Russian oil as absurd, warning that Moscow would not deliver oil and oil products to countries that support the decision.\n\nHT\n\nSource: ANI",

The statement, which notes that all EU nations will have to sign off on any sanctions changes, didnt provide a dollar range for the eventual price cap.\n\n\"The initial price cap will be set at a level based on a range of technical inputs and will be decided by the full coalition in advance of implementation in each jurisdiction,\" the ministers said in the statement. \"The price cap will be publicly communicated in a clear and transparent manner.\"\n\nThe G-7 plan, which is part of broader efforts to punish Russia for its military invasion of Ukraine, would allow buyers of Russian oil under a capped price to continue getting crucial services like financing and insurance for tankers.\n\nOil prices slightly pared gains on the news the G7 was nearing a deal as traders grappled with the probability of such a regime being imposed and any impact that might have.\n\n\"Todays action will help deliver a major blow for Russian finances and will both hinder Russias ability to fight its unprovoked war in Ukraine and hasten the deterioration of the Russian economy,\" US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. \"We have already begun to see the impact of the price cap through Russias hurried attempts to negotiate bilateral oil trades at massive discounts.\"\n\nTo implement a cap, diplomats will have to convince European Union member nations to amend its sixth round of sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraineand that may still prove to be tough. That package, which prohibits the purchase of Russian oil starting Dec. 5, included a ban on the use by third countries of the blocs companies for oil-related insurance and financial services.\n\nBut it remains unclear how effective a price-cap regime would be, particularly since some of Russias biggest buyers havent agreed to join. India is reluctant to formally join a price-cap scheme, since its industry worries it could lose out to other buyers on the chance to buy discounted Russian crude, according to people familiar with the views of Indian firms.\n\nU.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo visited India last month, where he said the coalition for putting a price cap on Russian oil has broadened and a number of countries have joined, while declining to name them.\n\n\"Quite extensive measures are going to have to be taken to ensure that companies dont find ways around price limitations,\" said Richard Watts, the managing director at Geneva commodities trading advisory HR Maritime. \"This was the challenge in Iraqs food-for-oil scheme in the 1990s. The question is how does the G7 police this?\"\n\nIt also wont be easy to get the EUs full backing. Hungary, which has maintained closer relations with Russia, held up agreement on the original sanctions package for weeks as the bloc tried to reach a deal on targeting Russias energy sector. Budapest has signaled that it would oppose any oil price cap, signaling another potentially awkward political fight.\n\nRussia said Friday that it wont sell oil to nations that impose a price cap on its oil. \"We simply wont interact with them on such non-market principles,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call, adding that Russian oil will find alternative markets.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have grappled with how best to sanction Russia after its invasion rattled energy markets and sent crude prices soaring. The G7which also includes Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Japan and Canadapledged earlier this year to curb reliance on Russian energy, including \"by phasing out or banning the import of Russian oil.\"\n\nG-7 leaders announced at a June summit in Elmau, Germany, that they would examine the price cap plan. But German Chancellor Olaf Scholz insists that the price cap can only work properly if its introduced globally and supported by more than just the G-7 countries. The backing of big buyers of Russian oil, such as India and Turkey, is seen as particularly crucial.\n\n\"The price cap fundamentally lacks impact unless the G-7 can persuade the other main buyers (i.e. China, India, Turkey, etc) to sign up,\" Christopher Haines, a global crude analyst at consultant Energy Aspects, said in an emailed response to questions. \"They are all reluctant despite the offer of exemptions from Western financial and shipping insurance sanctions. Meanwhile Russia will be determined to undermine the policy for both political and economic reasons.\"\n\nUS officials have argued that the price cap could work even if many buyers dont officially join the coalition, since they could still use the system for leverage in contract negotiations with Moscow to negotiate lower prices.\n\nAnother key factor will be at what level the price cap is set. U.S. officials have suggested they intend to fix it slightly above Russias marginal cost of production, according to a person familiar with the matter, although the final level would depend in part on the global oil price when it comes into effect.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Thursday said the measure, if adopted, would cut President Vladimir Putins oil revenue overall by \"forcing down the price of Russian oil to help blunt the impact of Putins war at the pump.\"\n\nWith assistance from Josh Wingrove, Archie Hunter, Kwaku Gyasi and Christopher Condon.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",

Ukraine hailed it as a turning point in the 6-month-old war, with thousands of Russian soldiers leaving behind ammunition stockpiles and equipment as they fled.\n\nRussian forces used Izium as the logistics base for one of their main campaigns a months-long assault from the north on the adjacent Donbas region comprised of Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nThe state-run TASS news agency quoted Russias defence ministry as saying it had ordered troops to leave the vicinity and reinforce operations elsewhere in Donetsk.\n\nThe head of Russias administration in Kharkiv told residents to evacuate the province and flee to Russia to \"save lives,\" TASS reported. Witnesses described traffic jams of cars with people leaving Russian-held territory.\n\nIf the reported gains are held, it would be a serious blow for Russia, which Western intelligence services say has suffered huge casualties. It would also be a big boost for Ukraine, which is keen to show Western nations supplying it with weapons it deserves their continued support.\n\nThere is pressure on Kyiv to demonstrate progress before winter sets in, amid threats by Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt all energy shipments to Europe if Brussels goes ahead with a proposal to cap the price of Russian oil exports.\n\nUkraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in Kyiv that Ukrainian forces had demonstrated they were capable of defeating the Russian army with the weapons given to them.\n\n\"And so I reiterate: the more weapons we receive, the faster we will win, and the faster this war will end,\" he said.\n\nIn his nightly video address on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraines armed forces had recovered around 2,000 square kilometres (770 square miles) of territory since its counter-offensive was launched earlier this month.\n\n\"The Russian army is claiming the title of fastest army in the world keep running!\" Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyys chief of staff, wrote on Twitter.\n\nUkrainian officials stopped short of confirming they had recaptured Izium, but Yermak earlier posted a photo of troops on its outskirts and tweeted an emoji of grapes. The citys name means \"raisin.\"\n\nThe Russian withdrawal announcement came hours after Ukrainian troops captured the city of Kupiansk farther north, the sole railway hub supplying Russias entire front line across northeastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials posted photos early on Saturday of their troops raising the countrys blue-and-yellow flag in front of Kupiansks city hall.\n\nThat left thousands of Russian troops abruptly cut off from supplies along a front that has seen some of the most intense battles of the war.\n\nIgor Girkin, a former commander of pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, called the Russian pullback \"a major defeat\" in remarks on Telegram.\n\nMechanised assault\n\nUkraine has for weeks been talking up a big counteroffensive in the south, which also is under way though details are sparse.\n\nRussia still occupies extensive territory in the Donbas and in the south near the Crimean Peninsula it seized in 2014.\n\nDays ago, Kyivs forces burst through the front line in the northeast and have since recaptured dozens of towns and villages in a swift mechanised assault, surging forward dozens of kilometres (miles) a day.\n\nUkraines deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, sounded a cautionary note, urging people not to report prematurely that towns have been \"taken\" just because Ukrainian troops were sighted. Troops entered Balakliia a few days ago, she said, but it was only on Saturday that Ukraine established control in the city.\n\nIn Hrakove, one of dozens of villages recaptured in the Ukrainian advance, Reuters saw burnt-out vehicles bearing the \"Z\" symbol of Russias invasion. Boxes of ammunition were scattered along with rubbish at positions the Russians had abandoned in evident haste.\n\n\"Hello everyone, we are from Russia,\" was spray-painted on a wall. Three bodies lay in white body bags in a yard.\n\nThe regional chief of police, Volodymyr Tymoshenko, said Ukrainian police moved in the previous day, and checked the identities of local residents who had lived under Russian occupation since the invasions second day.\n\n\"The first function is to provide help that they need. The next job is to document the crimes committed by Russian invaders on the territories which they temporarily occupied,\" he said.\n\nFighting is getting closer\n\nA witness in Valuyki, a town in Russias Belgorod region near the border with Ukraine, told Reuters she saw families from Kupiansk eating and sleeping in their cars along roads.\n\n\"I was at the market today and saw a lot of people from Kupiansk. They say half of the city was taken by the Ukrainian army and Russia is retreating the fighting is getting closer,\" the witness said.\n\nBelgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said officials were giving food and medical aid to people queuing at a crossing into Russia. Senator Andrey Turchak, from the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, reported more than 400 vehicles at the frontier.\n\nRussian rocket fire hit Kharkiv city on Saturday evening, killing at least one person and damaging several homes, part of a surge in shelling since Kyivs counter-offensive, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm the battlefield accounts.\n\n\"The advance is enormous. There are sporadic battles, but mostly the occupiers are fleeing,\" Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian television on Saturday.\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

We categorically reject this and insist that the collective West in this case, the EU, Canada, the UK - is to blame for the fact that the situation has reached the point where it is now.\"\n\nThe Kremlin says sanctions are disrupting the ability of Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE), which supplies and services equipment for the pipeline, to help repair the engine oil leak.\n\nWhen asked if Nord Stream would resume pumping if sanctions were eased, Peskov said: \"Definitely\".\n\nEU countries have repeatedly rejected Moscow's line, accusing it of weaponizing energy supplies, and on Monday German government spokesperson said the latest gas price surge was part of Putin's strategy.\n\nThe Kremlin also warned that Russia would retaliate over a G7 proposal to impose a price cap on Russian oil, a step that is unlikely to hurt Russia unless China and India were to follow suit. read more\n\nThe logo of Nord Stream AG is seen at an office building in the town of Vyborg, Leningrad Region, Russia August 22, 2022. REUTERS/Anton Vaganov/ Acquire Licensing Rights\n\n\"There can only be retaliatory measures,\" Peskov said.\n\nGAS WAR\n\nBy using its vast Siberian reserves of gas and oil to needle the West for its support of Ukraine, Russia has raised the stakes of the Ukraine war by unleashing a wave of inflation that could tip Europe's biggest economies into recession.\n\nRussia is the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, the world's top natural gas and wheat exporter. Europe imports about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin blamed Europe's political elites for its consumers' soaring energy bills.\n\n\"It is obvious that Europe is getting worse for people, entrepreneurs, companies, to live and work: less money is being earned, the standard of living is falling,\" Peskov said.\n\n\"And of course, ordinary citizens will have more and more questions about the leadership of their countries.\"\n\nAn estimated 70,000 people protested in Prague on Saturday, calling on the Czech government to do more to control soaring energy prices and voicing opposition to the European Union and NATO.\n\nBut an energy war has costs for an energy superpower too.\n\nSelling oil and gas westwards has been one of Russia's most profitable trades since the Soviet Union built pipelines to Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, often in the face of fierce opposition from the United States.\n\nRe-routing gas from the Urengoy field in northern Siberia to alternative customers such as China is no simple task: the Chinese border is 3,000 km (1864.11 miles) away and a pipeline would take time and money to build.\n\nWriting by Guy Faulconbridge Editing by Tomasz Janowski\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

But Mr Putin asserted that confidence in the dollar, euro and pound was being lost before people's eyes - while Russia was emerging from the war with its sovereignty strengthened.\n\nTass via Reuters\n\nThe Russian leader said Western currencies were falling while Russia was not losing anything\n\nRussia launched its invasion on 24 February and now occupies around a fifth of Ukrainian territory. Six months on, it has been pushed back from areas around Kyiv and the north and now faces a Ukrainian counter-offensive in the south and east.\n\nWestern nations responded to the war with several rounds of sanctions. The European Union has attempted to cut its reliance on Russian gas and oil and Moscow - and on Friday EU energy ministers will try to decide how to protect consumers and businesses from the threat of enormous bills over the winter.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Ursula von der Leyen said Europe had weakened Russia's grip on its gas requirements. Gas storage was already up to 82% and supplies had increased from the US, Norway, Algeria and other countries.\n\nBefore the invasion, Russia accounted for 40% of the EU's imported gas, but today that proportion was now down to only 9%, she said.\n\nAs well as a price cap on Russian gas, EU ministers have been looking at how to separate the cost of gas from the price of electricity, which are linked in Europe's market. The Commission president outlined several other plans:\n\nA mandatory target for reducing electricity use at peak hours\n\nA cap on revenues for companies making unexpected profits from low-cost electricity such as renewable energy\n\nA \"solidarity contribution\" from fossil fuel companies\n\nHelping struggling energy companies cope with the volatile energy market with \"liquidity\" support\n\nThe plans will go before energy ministers on Friday, and one diplomat told the BBC he was sceptical: \"Good luck getting that through council complete and intact.\"\n\nEU member states have already responded to the crisis with a series of packages to help consumers. At the weekend Sweden and Finland announced liquidity guarantees for power companies, while Germany said it would spend 65bn (56.2bn) with help for the vulnerable as well as tax breaks for energy-intensive businesses.\n\nIn Vladivostok, Mr Putin went on to accuse Europe of cheating the developing world out of Ukrainian grain exports in the wake of a UN-led deal to lift Russia's naval blockade.\n\nFor months ships were unable to leave Ukraine's three Black Sea ports but shipments resumed last month. Mr Putin told his audience that only two grain ships had since gone to Africa - which is not the case. He said he wanted to discuss revisiting the deal, in remarks rejected by Ukraine as groundless.\n\nOther ships have left for Yemen and Sudan while several vessels have gone to ports in Egypt.\n\nA UN-chartered ship carrying 23,000 tonnes arrived in Djibouti last week. The grain has now reached Ethiopia in 60 lorries, with the aim of feeding more than one and a half million people in a country blighted by drought and civil war.",

It coincided with the Group of Seven finance ministers announcing a price cap on Russian oil.\n\nThe euro slid to $0.9876 in early European trade, the lowest level since 2002, while sterling -- with the British economy also vulnerable to rising gas prices -- dropped half a percent to a new 2-1/2 year low of $1.1444.\n\n\"Gas flows have been curtailed even more than expected and we have already seen evidence of demand destruction weighing on activity,\" said Michael Cahill, a strategist at Goldman Sachs.\n\n\"We now expect the Euro to fall further below parity ($0.97) and remain around that level for the next six months,\" he added.\n\nECB MEETING\n\nIn what is a huge week for the euro, investors are also preparing for the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday and markets have priced a near 80% chance of a supersized 75 basis point (bp) interest rate hike.\n\nECB officials will be keen to see the euro, which has lost around 8% of its value in the past three months, stabilise. That will feed into the desire to try and tame inflation through tightening policy.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther currencies that tend to perform badly when market confidence is shaken also fell on Monday. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar slid 0.5% and was near a seven-week low at $0.6774.\n\nThe dollar's appeal as the go-to currency this year helped it to rise even against safe-haven currencies. The Japanese yen, , down at 140.35 per dollar, was under pressure near a 24-year low.\n\n\"The first order effect seems to be that the heightened geopolitical risk and consequent adverse global demand shocks will probably be the effects dominating,\" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.\n\n\"The adverse demand shocks in a very unsavoury geopolitical environment are probably going to trigger, and reflect, safe demand for the U.S. dollar ... the European currencies are perhaps going to be the worst hit and on the back foot.\n\nThe offshore yuan fell to a new two-year low, with the dollar gaining 0.4% to 6.9543 per dollar, as worries linger over COVID-19 lockdown measures in the country.\n\nChina's southern tech hub of Shenzhen said it would adopt tiered anti-virus restriction measures beginning on Monday, while Chengdu announced an extension of lockdown curbs, as the country grapples with fresh outbreaks.\n\n(Reporting by Tommy Reggiori Wilkes in London, Rae Wee in Singapore and Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, editing by Ed Osmond)",

The Russian leader described European calls for a price cap on Russian gas as \"stupid\" and said they would lead to higher global prices and economic problems in Europe. Last week, G7 countries agreed on a plan to put a ceiling on Russian oil prices in an attempt to stem the flow of funds into the Kremlins war coffers. Russia would walk away from its supply contracts if the west went ahead with its plans, Putin said. The Russian president said: Will there be any political decisions that contradict the contracts? Yes, we wont fulfill them. We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests. He added: We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil we will not supply anything. Russia \"would only have one thing left to do\", Putin said. As in the famous Russian fairytale, we would sentence the wolfs tail to be frozen. He said Germany and western countries themselves were to blame for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline not being operational and that Ukraine and Poland decided on their own to switch off other gas routes into Europe. He added: Nord Steam 1 is practically closed now.\n\nUpdated at 07.24 EDT\n\n7 Sept 2022 13.51 EDT Andrew Sparrow James Cleverly has reaffirmed the UKs \"steadfast support\" for Ukraine in his first call as foreign secretary. The Foreign Office said he spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart on Wednesday. In a statement shared on social media, Cleverly said: I just spoke to Dmytro Kuleba in my first call as foreign secretary. I reaffirmed the UKs steadfast support for Ukraine as they resist Putins barbaric invasion. What happens in Ukraine matters to us all and I will do everything possible to assist their fight for freedom.\n\n7 Sept 2022 13.49 EDT The leader of Russias governing party has proposed that a referendum should be held in occupied regions of Ukraine on 4 November on whether to become part of Russia. Andrei Turchak, head of Vladimir Putins United Russia party, said it would be \"correct and symbolic\" to hold votes on that date, a Russian public holiday which is celebrated as the Day of National Unity. Andrey Turchak, head of Putins ruling United Russia party, proposed to hold \"referenda\" on joining Russia in the Donbas and the \"liberated territories\" on 4 November, when Russia marks its Unity Day Pjotr Sauer (@PjotrSauer) September 7, 2022 Pro-Russian officials in occupied parts of Ukraine had previously suggested that a referendum on joining Russia would be held on 11 September. But on Monday, Russia-appointed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine said they are \"pausing\" a planned referendum because of attacks by Ukrainian forces. Writing on his partys website today, Turchak said that in any case, voting would \"definitely\" take place this year.\n\n7 Sept 2022 13.27 EDT Ukraine could seize Kherson by October, says former French general Ukrainian troops could be in a position to seize the entire right bank of the Dnieper River, including Kherson city, by October, according to a former French general. Ukrainian forces have methodically prepared their counterattack in the southern Kherson region, launching offensives on \"almost the entire southern frontline\", Gen Dominique Trinquand, former head of the French military mission to the UN, said in an interview with France 24. The Ukrainian counteroffensive appears to be \"progressing well\", he said, adding: The Russians seem surprised by the methods used. The destruction of ammunition depots and logistical hubs, particularly the railroads, have considerably destabilised them. Today, if the forces stationed west of the Dnieper River no longer receive shells, they will no longer be able to defend themselves. If they no longer receive food, it will be dramatic for some units. He also said: I think that before the winter, the Ukrainians could take over the whole right bank of the Dnieper, including the city of Kherson. If Ukraine succeeded in retaking this region, it would be a \"major coup\" and would be \"very damaging\" for Vladimir Putin, he added.\n\n7 Sept 2022 13.16 EDT Russian natural gas deliveries to the EU have dropped by 48% so far this year, according to the Russian gas giant Gazprom. Russia is in talks about a major infrastructure project to deliver gas to China via Mongolia, Vladimir Putin said earlier today. Gazprom has for years explored the possibility of supplying gas to China via Mongolia through a gas pipeline, the Power of Siberia 2. The proposed pipeline could carry 50bn cubic metres of natural gas a year, Gazprom has said, which is slightly less than the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that links Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. In a televised meeting with Mongolias prime minister, Luvsannamsrai Oyun-Erdene, Putin said: We are in discussions about the possible implementation of a major infrastructure project, I mean the supply of Russian gas to China via Mongolia.\n\nUpdated at 13.26 EDT\n\n7 Sept 2022 12.37 EDT The Kyiv Independents defence reporter, Illia Ponomarenko, has said \"something incredible\" is happening in the north-east Kharkiv region.

Since launching its counteroffensive last week, Ukrainian forces have made gains in the south with ambitious ground assaults after sustained attacks on command posts, ammunition stores, and fuel reserves far behind the frontlines, according to geolocation of video and satellite imagery. The US has seen Ukraine achieve some success in attacking Russian supply lines, with the intention of cutting off and isolating Russian troops currently deployed west of the Dnipro River, according to a senior US official. According to Ukrainian officials, the goal is to take at least all territory north or west of the Dnipro River, including not only the city of Kherson but also Nova Kakhovka. Nova Kakhovka houses an important hydroelectric plant as well as a canal that supplies Crimea with much of its water. At the same time, Ukraine has stepped up attacks in the east of the country in order to prevent Russia from shifting forces to the south to attempt to repel the Ukrainian counteroffensive there, according to US officials.

A local official told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the city of Nikopol on the opposite bank if the Dnieper river from Zaporizhzhia was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery. The report has not been independently verified. Regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said: There are fires, blackouts and other things at the [plant] that force us to prepare the local population for the consequences of the nuclear danger. In recent days, residents have been given iodine pills to help protect them from a radiation leak. The head of the UNs International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, warned the UN Security Council on Tuesday that \"something very, very catastrophic could take place\" at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA urged Russia and Ukraine to establish a \"nuclear safety and security protection zone\" around the plant. It is feared that fighting could lead to a disaster on the scale of Chernobyl.

Creating incentives for households to reduce their energy consumption will be crucial for getting Europe through the winter without rationing.\n\nBRUSSELS/VALLETTA Over the last few months, gas and electricity prices in Europe surged by nearly 100% to unprecedented levels, then fell by a third, and have now soared again since Russia announced that operation of Nord Stream 1, its gas pipeline to Germany, would remain suspended indefinitely. Many European leaders have reacted to the wild swings in Europes energy exchanges by blaming markets. But shooting the messenger is never the right approach.\n\nFor European policymakers, energy markets extreme volatility proves that these markets are no longer rational. In fact, natural gas is becoming a scarce good, and energy prices are simply responding accordingly. Russias suspension of Nord Stream I was not unexpected, given that European gas storage levels are increasing rapidly, and Russian President Vladimir Putin knows that he will lose his geopolitical leverage if Europe is prepared for winter without Russian gas.\n\nThe scale of the problem is immense. Before it invaded Ukraine, Russia met about 30% of Europes gas needs. Since February, European countries have been forced to compensate for this loss through energy savings and imports from alternative sources.\n\nOn the savings front, Europes record so far has been a mixed bag. The high price of gas has already led industry to cut back and use alternative fuels or reduce production, with German companies using 20% less gas in June compared to last year.\n\nBut the biggest gas users during the winter months will be households and as the weather gets colder, it will be difficult to convince people to cut back on heating their homes. European governments are already imploring consumers to turn down the thermostats and take fewer hot showers. But such appeals are likely to have little impact, and tightening rules for public buildings is expected to produce similarly small savings.\n\nEnsuring that households recognize gas scarcity will be crucial for getting Europe through the winter without having to resort to rationing. This will not be easy. On average, household gas prices have doubled since August 2021, but many consumers have not noticed this fully yet, because they use much less gas during the summer months and pay fixed monthly amounts that will be revised upward only later. Yet rising energy prices are already fueling massive protests across the continent.\n\nBLACK FRIDAY SALE: Save $50 on all new PS subscriptions BLACK FRIDAY SALE: Save $50 on all new PS subscriptions Subscribe now to gain greater access to Project Syndicate including every commentary and our entire On Point suite of subscriber-exclusive content starting at just $34.99. Subscribe Now\n\nIn the face of growing political pressure, several EU member states have introduced subsidies to reduce consumer prices. France has capped gas and electricity prices, and Italy has lowered the value-added tax rate for natural gas. As a result, household gas prices declined by 15% in Italy and remained stable in France, even as they rose by roughly 20% in Germany.\n\nThe fiscal cost of energy subsidies will be enormous, amounting to dozens of billions of euros in the larger EU countries. But thats not the worst of it. These price subsidies will cause demand for gas to fall less than it otherwise would: Consumers who pay less for gas will be less inclined to turn down the heating or take fewer and shorter hot showers. Europe will have to import more gas than it would have done if consumers had been forced, through higher energy prices, to recognize scarcity.\n\nMore to the point, where do European leaders think they will obtain the additional gas? Most gas producers are already working at peak capacity and will be unable to increase their output in the next few months. The only potential source of additional supply is liquefied natural gas diverted from Asia. But higher import demand from Europe will put even more pressure on global LNG prices, thus increasing Europes import bill.\n\nThe complicating factor is that European countries are not the only ones trying to protect consumers from high gas prices. Several major Asian importers, such as Japan and South Korea, also cap household prices. This might be one of the reasons why Asian gas demand has fallen only slightly so far, and why spot gas prices were high even before Russias war in Ukraine.\n\nAsian price caps result in higher import prices for Europe, which then lead European policymakers to increase the subsidies to keep consumer prices down, potentially setting in motion a vicious cycle of increasingly higher spot prices and larger subsidies. And prices may rise anyway, owing to the enormous impact that EU-wide subsidies would have on global prices.\n\nThere is a better way. Instead of subsidizing consumption through price caps, European governments should subsidize gas savings. For example, they could pay households to reduce their consumption this winter. This would also involve fiscal expenditure, but recent analysis suggests that such subsidies would mostly pay for themselves through lower import prices.\n\nAlternatively, policymakers could encourage energy savings by offering households a limited price cap. Under this scheme, subsidies would cover a basic amount per capita, with households paying the market price for consumption above this level.\n\nEither way, European policymakers would need to explain to their electorates that gas has become very scarce, that shielding them completely from higher prices is impossible, and that attempting to do so would be highly counterproductive. Instead, European leaders could use limited financial resources to create incentives for households to save and make it easier for Europe to end its reliance on Russian gas.",

Currently there is no benchmark for LNG trade in Europe, whereas in Asia the Japan Korea Marker is widely used.\n\nLNG in Europe was typically valued against the gas price at the Dutch TTF gas hub, but recently pricing agencies have started to turn to alternative benchmarks since volatile TTF prices do not reflect LNG market developments.\n\nPrices of LNG at different gas hubs, from the UK to Spain, have varied widely due to capacity constraints at some terminals.\n\nVon der Leyen outlined the EU's emergency plans to lower soaring gas and power prices, which have increased bills for households and hammered Europe's energy-intensive industries.\n\nThe EU wants to cap the revenue of non-gas fuelled generators and channel their \"unexpected profits\" into measures that support households and companies, von der Leyen said. read more\n\nEuropean power prices are typically set by gas plants, and this revenue cap would aim to reduce the cost of electricity generated by wind farms, nuclear plants and coal generators that have lower running costs as they are not exposed to surging gas prices.\n\nOil and gas companies that have reported big profit increases would also be required to make a \"solidarity contribution\", von der Leyen said, without giving further details.\n\nOther measures Brussels will put forward include a requirement for countries to cut electricity use during peak hours, and liquidity help for firms facing major collateral requirements.\n\nEU countries' energy ministers will discuss the proposals at an emergency meeting on Friday.\n\nReporting by Kate Abnett, Marwa Rashad, Marine Strauss, Gabriela Baczynska; editing by Jason Neely and Jane Merriman\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "Six months after the beginning of the Russian invasion, the \"Devils Dance\" of Western sanctions and Russian oil exports and revenues has barely begun. The main contest still lies ahead.\n\nNo aspect of the Western sanctions on Russia has been more controversial than their impact on Russian oil. It is widely asserted by the Western media (and of course by the Russians themselves) that the oil sanctions have failed. On the contrary, they are said to have contributed to the spike in global oil prices since the beginning of the Russian invasion in late February, and thus have increased Russian oil revenues rather than the opposite.\n\nBut is that in fact the case, and if so, why? Is it likely to remain so? Thanks for reading The Devil's Dance! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nFirst, a little bit of background: Russia is currently the second largest oil producer in the world, after the US and just ahead of Saudi Arabia. Approximately 70% of Russian oil production is exported, but oil is also widely used throughout the domestic economy, both as a motor fuel and as a feedstock for chemicals. Oil is thus essential to the Russian economy, and especially to the governments budget, half of which comes from oil revenues, foreign and domestic.\n\nConsequently Western sanctions have focused above all on driving down Russian oil production, exports and revenues. This is new. The sanctions adopted in the wake of Russias occupation of Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014-15 aimed only at constraining the long-term development of Russian oil production. They banned investment, services and imports for only three categories: Arctic, offshore and \"unconventional\" or shale oil. Their main consequence was to halt joint exploration projects with foreign oil majors; but their impact on actual production was insignificant, since virtually no output in those three categories had yet begun. An actual embargo on Russian oil exports was rejected, on the grounds that it would constitute an act of war.\n\nTHE NEW SANCTIONS SINCE THE INVASION\n\nThat has now changed radically. The sanctions against Russian oil now cover the entire range of Russian oil operations, from upstream exploration and production to refining and exports. The explicit aim is to constrict Russian oil revenues in any way possible, and thus to impede the funding of the war effort against Ukraine. It amounts to total economic warfare.\n\nThe new oil sanctions have three faces restrictions on shipping, on trade in relevant equipment and technology, and on finance. The first aims to prevent Russian oil from being transported and sold. The second bans the participation of Western companies in Russian exploration, development and refining, as well as the supply of oil-related technology. The third targets oil investment, by barring foreigners from investing in or supplying sanctioned Russian oil companies.\n\nWill these measures constrain Russian oil production, exports and revenues? The answer depends very much on the period one is looking at. The underlying logic behind the sanctions is that as time passes, they hit different parts of the industry, and in different ways. (I should add that this is my interpretation, not necessarily the intent of the designers.) In a first phase (essentially the years 2022-23), the impact falls mainly on the export outlets, i.e., the terminals and the tankers. In a second phase (the next three to five years), the sanctions begin the hit the upstream, that is, the actual producing fields. Finally, in Phase Three (starting about five years out), the sanctions hit the outer frontier, that is, exploration and production in new fields in new regions. Over time in theory, at any rate the chokehold on Russian oil, from one phase to the next, steadily tightens. But is it working?\n\nTHE FIRST THREE MONTHS: CONFUSION FOLLOWED BY ADAPTATION\n\nThe first month following the Russian invasion was marked by confusion on all sides. Satellite tracking revealed that the number of tankers near Russian ports had dropped, as tanker operators kept their distance, fearing reputational or legal damage. Consequently Russian exports of both crude and refined products declined. Yet at the same time upstream production remained unchanged, suggesting that oil was piling up unsold at the refineries and the export terminals. There were reports that refineries could not move their output, and refinery throughput abruptly declined. Excess crude, not finding a buyer, may have been stored at the export terminals, where there was initially excess capacity, or in tankers on the high seas.\n\nThe following two months brought the first signs of adaptation. Exports rebounded in April and May, suggesting that traders and shippers were discretely beginning to take Russian oil again. Millions of barrels of Russian crude were reported to be floating on the high seas, part of an increasingly \"dark fleet,\" with no reported destinations and transponders turned off.\n\nBut from direct observations it became apparent that a major shift was taking place. Faced with increasing resistance by buyers in northern Europe (previously its preferred destination), Russian seaborne crude began moving away from northern Europe toward Asia, chiefly China and India. Russia offered its crude at bargain terms, with discounts of up to $30 a barrel below the international \"Brent\" benchmark. India, in particular, proved an eager customer. By late April half of all of Russias maritime crude exports had shifted from Europe to Asia.\n\nThis shift to Asia was a second-best for Russia, since the longer travel times to India meant significantly higher shipping costs and higher insurance premiums, and also required more tankers. But the stark alternative would have been to cut back exports and accept production cuts in the fields.\n\nTHE COMING OIL EMBARGO AND PRICE CAP: WILL THEY WORK?\n\nThroughout these early months, global oil prices had been rising strongly, mainly because of trends in the world economy but partly also because of the uncertainties created by the Russian invasion. Despite some decline in export volumes, Russias oil revenues increased sharply. This produced mounting calls for sterner action. In early June, after tense debates among the member-nations, the EU declared on a ban on maritime imports of Russian oil to the EU, to go into effect on December 1 for crude oil and on February 1 for refined products. The embargo is likely to be coupled with a \"price cap\" on Russian oil, to go into effect at the same time.\n\nThe question is, will these work? The crucial challenge will be enforcement. There are three main problems. The first is the nature of the global oil trade. The world of oil tankers and traders is complex and opaque. Tankers fly many nations flags, but these typically tell us little about who actually owns them. On the eve of the invasion, it was estimated that perhaps half of all oil tankers handling Russian oil belong to Greek owners, many of them based in Cyprus, with the rest scattered among Russian companies, and some Chinese, Scandinavian and Singaporean companies[1]. Some of these are chartered by oil majors under long-term contracts, but most are also leased to oil traders, who include a growing number of smaller, independent traders and shippers. Tracking who is shipping what to whom is difficult at best and it is made more difficult by the rapid spread of new technology, which enables tankers to transmit fake their locations essentially by reporting \"digital mirages.\" Enforcing an embargo in this world is, at best, like herding cats.\n\nThe second problem is the difficulty of finding a weapon that can induce buyers and shippers to co-operate with the embargo and the price cap. The obvious candidate is the maritime insurance industry. On paper, this is a potent weapon; after all, without insurance no port will clear a cargo and no ship will sail. Conveniently, the insurance industry is concentrated in London; Lloyds of London handles most of the worlds shipping insurance. But a ban on insurance is surrounded with uncertainties: Will Londons insurers actually co-operate, and in what ways? Are there alternative insurance centres the Russians could turn to? The Russians themselves have talked about providing reinsurance, although so far there is little sign of it. In London, insurers are uneasy about the role being assigned to them, pointing out that they are \"not normally close to the price at which the oil is traded.\" Given these unknowns, it is not surprising that the insurance ban has lost favour in recent weeks, and there are reports that the UK government has cooled towards the idea.\n\nBut in that case, how will the European/UK embargo on maritime traffic be enforced? The third problem is lack of co-operation. India and China are unlikely to co-operate with a price cap. But the greater problem may turn out to be disunity within the European Union itself. To begin with, adopting a price cap will require a unanimous decision of the European Council, and Greek shipowners have urged the Greek government to withhold its agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Russias crude exports to Asia, after peaking in late April, have actually been fading steadily, while exports to Europe began moving from northern Europe to the Mediterranean. Whereas on the eve of the invasion crude exports to northern Europe outweighed those to the Mediterranean 3 to 1, by late August the ratio had flipped to the opposite.\n\nIf this trend continues, it suggests that the main battleground over the implementation of the coming EU embargo and the adoption of a price cap will be over crude deliveries to the Mediterranean, almost all of which go to Turkey and, increasingly, to Italy. These could be the most problematic parts of the coming EU embargo to enforce.\n\nIn sum, there are three uncertainties ahead: first, the enforcement of the coming EU oil embargo; second, the deterrence effect of any secondary sanctions against shipping companies (mainly bans on insurance); and third, a possible slowdown in Asian oil demand for oil, chiefly as a result of the declining performance of the Chinese economy. The \"thermometer\" that brings these three together is the discount on the price of Urals crude, which acts as a measure of risk vs. reward in the Russian export trade. It is perhaps symptomatic of the markets present assessment that there has been a slight declining trend in the discount, suggesting that both Russian exporters and Western shippers are betting that enforcement will be slack and that demand for Russian oil will remain strong.\n\nConclusion: the impact of the oil sanctions after six months of war\n\nSix months after the beginning of the Russian invasion, the \"Devils Dance\" of Western sanctions and Russian oil exports and revenues has barely begun. The main contest, mainly over the coming EU oil embargo and the price cap, still lies ahead.\n\nBut the real question ahead is the longer-term impact of the sanctions on upstream production and on the overall prospects for the future of Russian oil. There is no sign, so far, that the oil sanctions have had any significant impact on Russian oil production in the first six months of the war. But what about farther out? That will be the subject of my next Substack.\n\nThane Gustafson is the author and co-author of eight books on Russian affairs, including most recently Wheel of Fortune: the Battle for Oil and Power in Russia (2012), The Bridge: Natural Gas in a Redivided Europe (2020), and Klimat: Russia in the Age of Climate Change (2021), all with Harvard University Press.",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nWASHINGTON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven countries is working to cap the price of Russian oil in an attempt to limit Moscow's ability to fund its invasion of Ukraine, a plan analysts say could work in the long term but might boost oil prices in coming months.\n\nOfficials in G7 countries, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, say the unprecedented measure, set to begin Dec. 5, will cut the price Russia receives for oil without reducing its petroleum exports to world consumers.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin could push back, causing stress in oil markets even as the plan comes together.\n\nBelow are questions about the price cap and challenges it faces.\n\nWHO'S IN THE PRICE CAP COALITION?\n\nThe G7 wealthy nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- and the EU are hammering out details of the plan. The G7 wants to enlist other countries, including India and China, which have been snapping up heavily-discounted oil from Russia since its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has managed to maintain its revenues through those increased crude sales to India and China.\n\nBut even if India and China don't join, a cap could help force down prices for Asia and other consumers. U.S. Treasury Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Ben Harris said on Sept. 9 that if China negotiates a separate 30%-40% discount on Russian oil because of the price cap \"we consider that a win.\"\n\nThe consensus on the price cap level will be reached with the aid of a \"rotating lead coordinator,\" the U.S. Treasury Department said in guidance issued on Friday suggesting that countries in the coalition will have a temporary leadership role as the plan proceeds.\n\nWHAT'S THE LEVEL OF THE PRICE CAP?\n\nIt will likely be weeks before the price of Russian crude oil and two oil products will be decided, Harris said.\n\nWashington-based ClearView Energy Partners has said officials have been talking about a $40-$60 per barrel range for crude. The upper end of that range is consistent with historical prices for Russian crude, while the lower end is closer to Russia's marginal production cost, analysts say. read more\n\nCoalition members with long economic and military relations with Russia could push for a higher cap, while a limit too low could take market share away from Saudi Arabia and other oil producers. \"The level will be determined by both quantitative and qualitative reasons,\" said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group.\n\nRussian crude is priced at a discount to the international Brent benchmark and the G7 wants to keep that spread wide, to keep down Russian oil revenue.\n\nHowever, achieving a wide spread could mean higher prices for Western consumers as Russia is the world's second largest crude exporter, after Saudi Arabia.\n\nWHAT DOES THE G7 EXPECT FROM MARITIME SERVICES?\n\nThe plan agreed by the G7 calls for participating countries to deny Western-dominated services including insurance, finance, brokering and navigation to oil cargoes priced above the cap. read more\n\nTo secure those services, petroleum buyers would make \"attestations\" to providers saying they bought Russian petroleum at or below the cap.\n\nMaritime services providers will not be held liable for false pricing information provided by buyers and sellers of Russian petroleum, the U.S. Treasury said. read more\n\nG7 officials believe the plan will work because the London-based International Group of Protection & Indemnity Clubs provides marine liability cover for about 95% of the global oil shipping fleet.\n\nTraders point to parallel fleets that can handle Russian oil using Russian and other non-Western insurance that could be used to sidestep enforcement efforts. read more\n\nIt remains uncertain how many ports around the world will accept Russian-insured ships.\n\nCraig Kennedy, an associate at Harvard University's Davis Center for Eurasian and Russian Studies, said the G7 has long term leverage because Moscow is constrained by a small tanker fleet versus the vast scale of exports it needs to get out. If Russia doesn't want to sell at the cap, it may have to shut in production, which could impose long-term costs on its oilfields.\n\nHOW COULD RUSSIA FIGHT BACK?\n\nPutin has said Russia will withhold exports to countries that enforce the cap, and fears about the threat could cause petroleum markets to rise before December.\n\nHigher prices could also be risky for U.S. President Joe Biden ahead of midterm elections in November when his fellow Democrats hope to keep control of Congress.\n\nSome analysts worry Moscow could respond by taking actions beyond Russia's borders before the cap takes effect.\n\n\"My biggest concern is I think Putin is going to make it very, very painful on the way to Dec. 5,\" Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told a Brookings Institution event on Sept. 9. \"They also have assets in other producing countries, whether it be Libya, whether it be Iraq, and they have an ability to cause some problems in other producer states.\"\n\nHOW WILL THE CAP BE ENFORCED?\n\nThe U.S. Treasury warned service companies to be vigilant about red flags indicating potential evasion or fraud by Russian oil buyers. Those could include evidence of deceptive shipping practices, refusal to provide requested price information, or excessively high services costs. read more\n\nDeputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said on Friday that those who falsify documentation or otherwise hide the true origin or price of Russian oil would face consequences under the domestic law of jurisdictions implementing the price cap.\n\nReporting by Timothy Gardner; Additional reporting by David Lawder and London energy team; Editing by Daniel Wallis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The cap will be set at a level based on a range of technical inputs.\n\n\"We will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" the G7 said.\n\nRussia said it would stop selling oil to countries that imposed price caps.\n\n\"Companies that impose a price cap will not be among the recipients of Russian oil,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nThe G7 (Group of Seven) consists of the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. The group is an organisation of the world's seven largest \"advanced\" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system.\n\nAt their virtual meeting, the finance ministers said the oil price cap plan was \"specifically designed\" to reduce Russian revenues and its ability to \"fund its war of aggression\". They also said they wanted to minimise the damaging economic fallout of the conflict, \"especially on low and middle-income countries\".\n\nThe introduction of a price cap on Russian oil means countries that sign up to the policy will only be permitted to purchase Russian oil and petroleum products transported via sea that are sold at or below the price cap.\n\nIn the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine the price of oil soared and has remained at high levels, meaning Russia has increase its revenues from the fossil fuel despite its export volumes falling.\n\nThe EU plans to impose an embargo on Russian crude oil from 5 December. It will apply to crude shipped by tanker and most piped supplies.\n\nChina and India - major trading partners for Russia - may not follow G7 policy on Russian oil, analysts say. They have not joined the Western sanctions targeting Russia.\n\nUK Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the G7 were \"united against this barbaric aggression\", adding the price cap would \"curtail Putin's capacity to fund his war\".\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said a cap would also help fight inflation, which is on the rise in many of the world's economies.\n\nThe price cap helps achieve \"our dual goals of putting downward pressure on global energy prices while denying Putin revenue to fund his brutal war in Ukraine\", she said.\n\nThe G7 agreement to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil is certainly symbolic. How effective it is in practice will depend on the level of the cap and how it is enforced.\n\nEnergy prices have soared since Russia invaded Ukraine - and the revenues from oil sales have been helping to finance Vladimir Putin's aggression.\n\nSo cut off that financial lifeline, and waging war becomes much more difficult.\n\nIn fact, oil from Russia has been a lot cheaper than crude from other sources for months, due to a combination of official sanctions and a reluctance by some to trade in it.\n\nBut refiners in places like India and China have still been happy to buy it, and Russia's coffers have been filling up as a result.\n\nSo the price cap needs to be a lot lower than the level Russian oil is already trading at - and the enforcement mechanism needs to be absolutely watertight.",

They said, however, that key details, including the per-barrel level of the cap would be determined later \"based on a range of technical inputs\" to be agreed by the coalition of countries implementing it.\n\n\"Today we confirm our joint political intention to finalise and implement a comprehensive prohibition of services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally,\" the ministers said.\n\nThe provision of Western-dominated maritime transportation services, including insurance and finance, would be allowed only if the Russian oil cargoes are purchased at or below the price level \"determined by the broad coalition of countries adhering to and implementing the price cap.\"\n\nOleg Ustenko, a senior economic adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed the development, and said he expected the price range to be between $40 and $60.\n\n\"This is fantastic. It's exactly what we needed\" to reduce the revenues that Russia was collecting, he told Reuters. Brent crude futures rose 66 cents to $93.02 a barrel on Friday.\n\nZelenskiy himself, in a video address, said a cap should also be imposed on Russian natural gas exports.\n\nA senior U.S. Treasury official said the coalition would set a dollar price limit for Russian crude and two others for petroleum products -- not discounts to global market prices. The cap would be revisited as needed.\n\nThe G7 ministers said they would work to finalize the details in time to launch by Dec. 5, when new European Union sanctions initiate a ban on Russian oil imports.\n\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner, the current G7 finance chair, said the price cap on Russian oil exports was designed to reduce President Vladimir Putin's revenues.\n\n\"At the same time, we want to curb rising global energy prices. This will minimize inflation globally,\" he said.\n\nOIL CUTOFF THREAT\n\nA view shows the crude oil terminal Kozmino on the shore of Nakhodka Bay near the port city of Nakhodka, Russia August 12, 2022.

China and India also would seek to buy oil at the capped price, she added.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire injected a dose of reality, telling his G7 counterparts that more work was needed to work out technical details, persuade a critical mass of importers to join the plan and preserve European unity on the subject, his office said in a statement.\n\n\"We got positive signals from other countries, but no firm commitments yet,\" a senior G7 source said of efforts to recruit other countries. \"We wanted to send a signal of unity towards Russia and also countries like China.\"\n\nThe G7 announcement had little effect on benchmark crude prices, which rose in anticipation of an OPEC+ discussion of output cuts on Monday amid weaker demand read more\n\nEnforcing the cap would rely heavily on denying London-brokered shipping insurance, which covers about 95% of the world's tanker fleet, and finance to cargoes priced above the cap. But some analysts say alternatives could be found to circumvent it. read more\n\nThe G7 ministers said they would seek to limit circumvention through \"a record-keeping and attestation model covering all relevant types of contracts\" that aims for consistent enforcement across jurisdictions.\n\nDespite Russia's falling oil export volumes, its June export revenue increased by $700 million from May due to prices pushed higher by its war in Ukraine, the International Energy Agency said last month.\n\nPRICING CONCERNS\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has raised concerns the EU embargo could set off a scramble for alternative supplies, spiking global crude prices to as much as $140 a barrel, and it has been promoting the price cap as a way to keep Russian crude flowing.\n\nRussian oil prices have risen in anticipation of the EU embargo, with Urals crude trading at an $18-to-$25 per barrel discount to benchmark Brent crude, down from a $30-to-$40 discount earlier this year. read more\n\nAdditional reporting by Jan Strupczewski, Matthias Williams, Steve Scherer, William James, Leigh Thomas, Timothy Gardner, Daphne Psaledakis, Andrea Shalal, David Ljunggren and Rami Ayyub; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan, Chizu Nomiyama, Jonathan Oatis and Andrea Ricci\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Because all energy sources must help to overcome this crisis,\" she said on Wednesday (7 September), ahead of an extraordinary meeting of EU energy ministers to address the energy crisis.\n\nEU chief lays out five measures to tackle energy crisis Brussels outlined on Wednesday (7 September) five proposals to tackle the high energy prices gripping Europe, including a mandatory target for reducing electricity use, capping the revenues of energy firms, and recycling the money raised to help vulnerable households.\n\n\"The solidarity contributions are justified by the fact that such companies make unpredictable surplus profits,\" the draft said. \"Those profits do not correspond to any regular profit that these entities would or could have expected to obtain in normal circumstances,\" it adds.\n\nBP and Shell had no immediate comment. TotalEnergies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA rapid recovery in demand following the pandemic and a surge in oil and gas prices driven by Russias invasion of Ukraine have boosted profits for energy companies this year.\n\nIn the second quarter, Europes biggest oil companies TotalEnergies and Shell posted a quarterly profit of $9.8 billion and a record-high $11.5 billion, respectively.\n\nThe EU measure would apply to a companys surplus profits from 2022 at a level to be specified above the average taxable profits in the three fiscal years since January 2019, the draft said, adding that they would be assured of enough profit margin for future investments.\n\nSome countries, including Italy, have already introduced a windfall profit tax on excess profits made by electricity firms during the crisis. The solidarity contribution from oil and gas companies, would complement this to ensure fairness among energy companies, EU officials explained.\n\nThe draft said Brussels would put in place a minimum rate for all EU countries, but governments could choose to go higher.\n\nThe measure would be passed by a reinforced majority of member states, meaning it would not require unanimous approval from the EUs 27 member countries.\n\nThe Commission would also propose clawing back revenue from non-gas fuelled power plants that gain from selling electricity at sky-high costs, but which do not have to pay huge bills for fuel, to help consumers cope with surging power bills, the draft said.\n\nIn addition, the draft outlined targets for EU countries to reduce electricity demand as well as a life-raft for power firms facing a liquidity crunch.\n\nLEAK: EU plans 'revenue cap' on power firms, mandatory electricity savings at peak hours A draft EU law for the first time introduces obligatory demand reduction targets for electricity consumption, and places \"a revenue limit\" on power companies making windfall profits from the energy crisis, according to a leaked proposal seen by EURACTIV.\n\nNational price caps sprouting across Europe\n\nMeanwhile, across Europe companies and governments scrambled for ways to tackle the crisis.\n\nIn France, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said consumers would be protected by new caps on energy prices when current ones run out this winter although there would be some increases as it would be \"completely irresponsible to put the burdensolely on the state budget\".\n\nIn neighbouring Spain, Iberdrola said it would guarantee gas and power supply for five months to customers deemed vulnerable by the Red Cross, after which all outstanding bills must be paid.\n\nItalys main business lobby group Confindustria said it was in talks with the government about how any potential gas rationing would take place.\n\nWith the EU seeking to diversify its energy supply Finlands Gasgrid said it aimed to begin importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) via a planned floating terminal in January.\n\nSeparately, the EUs securities watchdog said it was \"actively considering\" potential measures to ease strains in energy markets where some participants face difficulties in finding enough cash to cover positions.\n\nToo little gas\n\nAs the European Commission drafts the new series of EU measures, Norway warned against gas price caps.\n\n\"A maximum price would not solve the fundamental problem, which is that there is too little gas in Europe,\" Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said after a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nNorway, which is a close ally of the EU, has become the blocs largest supplier of gas after Russia cut back exports in the wake of the Ukraine war, giving it record income from its petroleum industry as prices soared.\n\nEU ministers expressed reservations last week about a price cap targeting only Russian gas, which accounted for around 40% of the blocs gas before its invasion of Ukraine. That share has plummeted to 9%, as Moscow cut supplies, blaming technical issues caused by sanctions.\n\nNatural gas flows from Russia to Europe along key routes were steady on Monday, while the Nord Stream 1 pipeline remained shut.\n\nRussia has said it would cut all supplies if a cap on its gas was introduced.\n\nEU countries call on Brussels to cap gas prices, but leave out details EU energy ministers on Friday (9 September) called on the European Commission to cap gas prices amid growing urgency to tackle skyrocketing bills hitting consumers and businesses.\n\n[Edited by Frdric Simon]\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

It later fell back and was last down 0.2% at 109.74.\n\nECB MEETING\n\nIn what is a huge week for the euro, investors are also preparing for Thursday's European Central Bank (ECB) meeting and markets have priced a near 80% chance of a supersized 75 basis point (bp) interest rate hike .\n\nECB officials will be keen to see the euro, which has lost around 8% of its value in the past three months, stabilise. That will feed into the desire to try to tame inflation through tightening policy.\n\n\"Should the ECB push back so prematurely on market pricing, it will likely draw the curtains for the euro's burial,\" said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe.\n\n\"While this would come as welcome news to the German manufacturing sector, which has seen new export orders continue to shrink, it would only fan the current energy related inflation pressures, making the ECB's goal of price stability even harder to reach.\"\n\nOther currencies that tend to perform badly when market confidence is shaken also fell on Monday.

REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nOct 11 (Reuters) - Europe faces massive increases in energy bills driven by rocketing gas prices as the Ukraine conflict and European sanctions on Russia heighten concerns over gas supplies.\n\nHere are some of the policies Britain, Norway and European Union member states have announced to help shield consumers (in alphabetical order):\n\nBRITAIN\n\nBritain has capped the price of average household energy bills at 2,500 pounds ($2,770) a year for two years from October. Without the measure, average home energy bills were tipped to reach over 3,500 pounds a year in October with forecasts of much higher bills to come. read more\n\nThe freeze in the price per unit suppliers can charge for gas and electricity comes on top of a 15-billion-pound support package to help households set out in May through which every household will receive a 400-pound credit to their energy bills from October.\n\nMore than eight million low-income households receiving state benefits are also being given a further one-off 650-pounds, with additional help for pensioners and disabled people.\n\nBULGARIA\n\nBulgaria introduced a discount of 0.25 levs ($0.12) per litre of petrol, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and methane from July until the end of the year for households, and scrapped excise duties on natural gas, electricity and methane.\n\nThe Balkan country, a net electricity exporter, has also kept regulated prices for electricity for households at bay, allowing only an average 3.4% annual increase as of July.\n\nCROATIA\n\nCroatia has capped households' electricity prices from Oct. 1 until March 1 at 59 euros ($57.41) per megawatt hour (MWh) and 88 euros/MWh depending on how much electricity they use over a six-month period.\n\nCZECH REPUBLIC\n\nThe Czech government has agreed to cap electricity and gas prices next year to shield households from soaring prices.\n\nPrices for households would be capped at 6 crowns ($0.24) per kilowatt hour (KWh) of electricity and 3 crowns for gas.\n\nDENMARK\n\nIn June, lawmakers agreed a cash handout to the elderly and other measures totalling 3.1 billion Danish crowns ($406 million) to cushion the impact of soaring inflation and high energy prices, including a cut to a power price levy. read more\n\nLawmakers had previously agreed on subsidies worth 2 billion Danish crowns to be paid to some 419,000 households hard hit by rising energy bills.\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\n\nEuropean Union countries are largely responsible for national energy policies, and EU rules allow them to take emergency measures to protect consumers from higher costs.\n\nThe EU in July asked the 27 member states to reduce gas demand voluntarily by 15% this winter, with mandatory cuts possible. read more\n\nThe European Commission is also discussing a gas price cap but has yet to agree any details. read more\n\nFINLAND\n\nFinland's government in September said it planned to offer up to 10 billion euros of liquidity guarantees to the energy sector to help prevent a financial crisis. read more\n\nFRANCE\n\nFrance has committed to capping an increase in regulated electricity costs at 4%. To help do this the government has ordered utility EDF (EDF.PA), which is 80% state-owned, to sell more cheap nuclear power to rivals. read more\n\nNew measures announced since the Ukraine crisis - such as helping companies with the cost of higher gas and power bills - bring the total cost of the government package to between 25 billion and 26 billion euros ($27 billion), Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.\n\nGERMANY\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz in September set out a 200 billion euro ($194 billion) \"defensive shield\", including a gas price brake and a cut in sales tax for the fuel, to protect companies and households from the impact of soaring energy prices.\n\nUnder the plans, to run until spring 2024, the government will introduce an emergency price brake on gas.\n\nA temporary electricity price brake will subsidise basic consumption for consumers and small and medium-sized companies. Sales tax on gas will fall to 7% from 19%.\n\nGREECE\n\nGreece has devoted over 9 billion euros to power subsidies and other measures since last September to help households, businesses and farmers pay their electricity and gas bills. read more\n\nFor households with monthly electricity consumption of up to 500 KWh - the majority of Greek homes - the subsidy will reach 436 euros per MWh, absorbing 90% of the rise in bills.\n\nFor those consuming 501 to 1,001 KWh per month, and those consuming over 1,001 KWh, the subsidy will absorb 70-80% of the increase.\n\nHUNGARY\n\nHungary has capped retail fuel prices at 480 forints ($1.09) per litre since November, well below current market prices. The measure led to such an increase in demand that the government was forced to curb eligibility for the scheme.\n\nSharp rises in gas and electricity prices have also forced the government to curtail a years-long cap on retail utility bills, setting the limit at national average consumption levels, with market prices applying above that.\n\nITALY\n\nItaly approved an aid package worth some 14 billion euros ($14 billion) in September to shield firms and families from surging energy costs.\n\nThe measures came on top of some 52 billion euros already budgeted since January to soften the energy crisis in Italy.\n\nAmong a raft of other measures, the scheme envisages a one-off 150-euro handout for 22 million workers and pensioners with an annual income below 20,000 euros. A cut in excise taxes on fuel at the pump will stay in place until November instead of Oct. 17.\n\nNETHERLANDS\n\nThe Dutch government earlier this month said it expected to spend about 23.5 billion euros on a price cap on energy contracts to shield consumers from surging prices.\n\nDuring the whole of 2023, prices will be capped at 0.40 euros per KWh of electricity and 1.45 euros per cubic metre of gas for a maximum of 2,900 KWh and 1,200 cubic metres respectively.\n\nNORWAY\n\nNorway has been subsidising household electricity bills since December and now covers 80% of the portion of power bills above a certain rate. This will be increased to 90% from September, with the scheme to remain in place until at least March 2023.\n\nPOLAND\n\nMeasures aimed at curbing Polish energy prices will cost over 30 billion zlotys ($6 billion) Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in September.\n\nIn 2023, Poland will freeze power prices for households using up to 2000 KWh a year, while a 10% cut in electricity use will be rewarded with a 10% price cut. The government will spend 5-6 billion zlotys to support energy intensive companies.\n\nROMANIA\n\nRomania's coalition government has implemented a scheme capping gas and electricity bills for households and other users up to certain monthly consumption levels, and compensating energy suppliers for the difference. The scheme is due to be in place until March 2023.\n\nSPAIN\n\nSpain has begun to temporarily subsidise fossil fuel plants' power costs in a bid to bring down high prices in the short term.

Ammar Awad/Reuters\n\nRussian shelling killed four Ukrainian civilians in Donetsk Province over the weekend, offering a grim reminder of the continuous battle in the countrys east even as the wars focus has shifted to the south.\n\nThe governor for Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Sunday that two people had been killed a day earlier in the village of Velyka Novosilka, which is about 60 miles west of the regional capital. Shelling also killed one person in the city of Siversk, which is north of Donetsk, and another in the village of Vodiane, Mr. Kyrylenko said. Two people were wounded.\n\nMr. Kyrylenko added in a post on the Telegram messaging app that 797 civilians have died and more than 20,000 have been wounded in the Donetsk region since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.\n\nBut Ukraines new attempt to regain ground in the southern province of Kherson, which was lost to Moscow at the start of the war, has shifted the dynamics in the east.\n\nAfter failing to capture Ukraines capital early in the war, Russian forces switched focus to try to seize control of the eastern Donbas region, which is made up of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces. They had captured nearly all of Luhansk by early July of this year, but their efforts since to take control of neighboring Donetsk have stalled.\n\nThat is in part because of a weekslong pause by Moscow in its offensive to rotate and refresh troops, but also because Ukraine has been preparing defensive positions in Donetsk since 2014 when rebels loyal to Russia seized government buildings there and in Luhansk, beginning a long trench war with Ukrainian forces that are difficult to dislodge. Ukrainian attacks on Russian ammunition depots and other supply points behind the front lines, using longer-range artillery supplied by Western countries, have also slowed Russias advances in Donetsk.\n\nNow, an uptick in fighting in Kherson has changed the calculus for both sides in Donetsk.\n\n\"As Ukraine tries to make advances in Kherson and the Russian military fights and tries to defend that territory, the rest of the Russian forces attempt to make incremental advances on Donbas,\" Michael Kofman, director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for a New American Security, said on the War on the Rocks podcast.\n\nThere are signs that Moscow might reinforce its troops in the east to renew its stalled campaign. Ukrainian military intelligence has said in recent days that the Russian armys newest grouping the 3rd Army Corps will likely be deployed to Donbas.\n\nIt would be the first major new formation of troops to be dispatched by the Kremlin since it launched a campaign in July to bring in new recruits though military analysts have questioned the groupings combat readiness.\n\n\"Images of the 3rd Army Corps elements have shown the volunteers to be physically unfit and old,\" a recent analysis by the Institute for the Study of War said.\n\nAnalysts say that fighting in eastern Ukraine will almost certainly stretch into next year. A likely hiatus in offensive operations in the winter will give both sides an opportunity to train new forces, and so it will be critical for Ukraine to force Russia to commit new troops just to hold its current positions, the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank that specializes in security issues, said in a report.\n\nThe United States government estimated in July that 15,000 Russians had been killed since February and said that Ukraine had also suffered significant losses. On Sunday, Britains ministry of defense said in an intelligence update that Russian troops were continuing to suffer from low morale.\n\n\"With the prospect of a bitter winter spent outdoors, there is ample opportunity to ensure that Russias forces remain cold, wet, hungry, miserable and therefore vulnerable to shock and a collapse in morale,\" the report said.",

                "cc_text": "Hong Kong/London CNN Business\n\nThe Wests biggest economies on Friday agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil in an attempt to reduce Moscows ability to fund its war in Ukraine without further stoking global inflation.\n\nFinance ministers from the G7 group of countries the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom said they would ban the provision of \"services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally\" above the price cap. That could block insurance cover or finance for oil shipments.\n\nThe maximum price would be set by \"a broad coalition\" of countries, they said in a joint statement. It would take effect alongside the European Unions next batch of sanctions, which include a ban on seaborne imports of Russian oil starting in early December.\n\nRussia had already threatened to retaliate by banning oil exports to countries that implement a price cap.\n\n\"We will simply not supply oil and petroleum products to such companies or states that impose restrictions, as we will not work non-competitively,\" Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told reporters Thursday, according to state news agency TASS.\n\nThe Biden administration has been pushing for governments to introduce a price cap for months. The West has already sanctioned many Russian energy exports, but Moscow has continued to earn billions of dollars a month by diverting oil to countries such as China and India.\n\n\"The price cap is specifically designed to reduce Russian revenues and Russias ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russia s war on global energy prices, particularly for low and middle-income countries,\" the G7 finance ministers said.\n\nBut the measure still needs work and will be extremely complex to manage. The price at which Russian oil will be capped still needs to be hashed out. It would also need wider international support to be effective.\n\n\"What China and India do is going to need to be a national decision for them,\" a senior US Treasury Department official said on a call with reporters Friday.\n\nBut if the cap forces Russia to strike cheaper deals with trading partners by putting a ceiling on the price at which they can sell their products, it will still achieve its goals, the official added.\n\nNovak has called the proposals to impose restrictions \"completely absurd\" and said they could destroy the global oil market, TASS reported.\n\n\"Such attempts will only destabilize the oil industry, the oil market,\" he said.\n\nRussia could offer alternative insurance for its oil shipments. But the US Treasury official noted they would be more expensive, raising incentives for buyers to opt in to the price cap system.\n\nFlows of crude oil and other oil products to the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Japan and South Korea have dropped by nearly 2.2 million barrels per day since the start of the war in Ukraine, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nBut two-thirds of this decline has been rerouted to other markets, helping pad Moscows coffers. Export revenues in July were about $19 billion, the IEA said.\n\nRussias control of large swaths of global energy supplies remains a major challenge six months since its invasion of Ukraine. This week, Russia temporarily halted natural gas deliveries to the region through a vital pipeline and cut off all supplies to a French utility, exacerbating problems that have sent European inflation to a record high of 9%.\n\nOn Friday, shortly after the G7 announcement, Russian state energy giant Gazprom said it would not resume deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Saturday as planned. The company cited an oil leak, and didnt give a timeline of when the shimpments might resume.\n\nChris Liakos, Anna Cooban and Manveena Suri contributed to this report.",

Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nThe decision, made in yet another brief meeting Sept. 5 with no extended debate, will mark the alliance's first reduction in output targets in 22 months and return quotas to August levels, when OPEC's 13 members aimed to pump 26.689 million b/d, while Russia and eight other partners committed to 15.414 million b/d, for a combined ceiling of 42.103 million b/d.\n\nIn practice, however, with the bulk of OPEC+ countries already struggling to reach their quotas, not much supply will be lost.\n\nMinisters are scheduled to convene again Oct. 5 to decide on November production levels, though in a statement, they said they held the option to meet \"anytime to address market developments, if necessary.\"\n\nFront-month Brent futures prices jumped to nearly $97/b in the wake of the announcement, though they later fell back to $95.78 at 1700 GMT, continuing a slide from around $123/b in June.\n\nThe cut \"sends a bullish signal about a willingness to reduce output to support higher price objectives,\" Platts Analytics' Nareeka Ahir said in a note.\n\nIt comes after Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Aug. 22 decried a \"disconnect\" between the futures and physical oil markets and declared that the OPEC+ coalition could cut output, in a bid to shore up how paper prices reflected supply/demand fundamentals. His remarks were quickly echoed by other OPEC+ ministers.\n\n\"Current volatility and thin liquidity send erroneous signals to markets at times when clarity is most needed,\" an advisory OPEC+ technical committee said in a report Sept. 1. \"This is detrimental because, without sufficient liquidity, markets can't reflect the realities of the physical fundamentals in a meaningful way and can give a false sense of security at times when spare capacity is severely limited and the risk of severe disruptions remains high.\"\n\nPhysical vs futures\n\nThe modest cut also serves as a rejection to US President Joe Biden and other leaders of major consuming countries, who have lobbied the OPEC+ alliance for more crude supplies to loosen a tight market. Biden visited Saudi Arabia and met with Gulf leaders in July.\n\nThe decrease in quotas will occur as an International Energy Agency-coordinated release of crude from strategic petroleum reserves of some 1.5 million b/d is scheduled to end in October.\n\nThe EU's ban on seaborne imports of Russian crude is also set to start in December, while G7 countries said Sept. 2 they will \"urgently\" finalize and implement a price cap on Russian oil exports.\n\nPlatts Analytics forecasts Russian crude and condensate production will fall by 1.2 million b/d between July and January 2023, to 1.5 million b/d below pre-conflict volumes.\n\nThose looming factors, plus the prospects of higher oil consumption for power generation this winter as gas supplies are stretched, have kept physical crude prices elevated over their futures counterparts.\n\nFor example, Platts assessed November cash Dubai versus same-month Dubai futures at a premium of $5.96/b at the Sept. 5 close, up 8 cents/b on the day.\n\nBut the bullish indicators have been tempered by the prospect of a global recession, spurred in large part by high energy prices.\n\nRenewed lockdown measures in several Chinese cities have also stoked fears of a slowdown in oil demand, while on the supply side, a revived Iran nuclear deal remains in limbo.\n\nProduction gaps\n\nSaudi Arabia, the largest OPEC+ producer, now that Russia is hampered by western sanctions, is set to pump 11 million b/d in September, a level that it has only sustained for a month two times in its history. Saudi officials have said the kingdom has the capacity to hit 12.5 million b/d of production, but many analysts say maintaining output at such high levels for an extended period would risk damaging its fields and infrastructure.\n\nAs such, a slight decrease in production would help maintain the health of its oil system, while keeping some spare capacity in reserve for future unexpected global supply outages.\n\nBesides Saudi Arabia, the UAE is the only other member with significant spare capacity, with upside of some 800,000 b/d or so from current output levels.\n\nEvery other OPEC+ country is either at or near its maximum production or has suffered major losses due to sanctions, lack of investment or technical problems.\n\nThe 18 OPEC+ members with quotas produced 2.8 million b/d below their targets in July, according to the latest Platts survey of the group's output by S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\nRussia's key OPEC+ negotiator and Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that the decision was taken due to the current market situation, citing the group's technical committee downgrade of global GDP growth to 3.1% from 3.5%.\n\nHe added that OPEC+ will continue to monitor the market situation further, including G7 discussions on a Russian price cap\n\n\"We will look at how the situation on the market develops. There are a lot of uncertainties, including over-production in countries that are not part of the agreement, statements by individual G7 leaders and consideration of establishing a price ceiling for the purchase of Russian oil,\" Novak said in comments broadcast on the Russia 24 TV channel.\n\nOPEC+ quotas\n\nOPEC Jul-22 Aug-22 Sep-22 Oct-22 Algeria 1.039 1.055 1.057 1.055 Angola 1.502 1.525 1.529 1.525 Congo 0.320 0.325 0.325 0.325 Eq.

Now that the war has passed the half-year mark, we asked the question againand found several surprises, along with themes already visible the first time around. The liberal West has held together astonishingly well, with NATO reinvigorated by the addition of two new members and the European Union discovering a new role waging economic war. The conflicts lessons reach far beyond Europe, impacting strategic competition with China as well. The war also points to some problems for Washingtons strategists. First and foremost: Most countries outside the West have refused to choose sides. The conflict has also accelerated a painful process of decoupling between the superpowersespecially in technologywhich likely puts the final nails in the coffins of unfettered globalization and open markets, key planks of the post-Cold War order. That, too, will require new thinking on many policy fronts. Below, seven experts weigh in on these and other lessons for future U.S. strategy. Stefan Theil, deputy editor\n\nIts Back to the Future for U.S. Grand Strategy\n\nBy Angela Stent, the author of Putins World: Russia Against the West and With the Rest and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\n\nJavelin anti-tank missiles next to U.S. flags.\n\nRussias unprovoked invasion of Ukraine ended the first phase of the post-Cold War era. It now appears that the United States grand strategy is headed back to the future. The war has underlined Washingtons indispensable leadership role as Europes security guarantor and brought home the reality for its NATO allies that they can only protect themselves under the U.S. umbrella. The European Union has, for all its plans and ambitions, failed to achieve its own strategic autonomy. Other institutionsthe United Nations and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europehave also failed to respond adequately to Russias invasion and the security threat Moscow poses for Europe. While the United States has provided the lions share of weapons for Ukraine and enabled it to push back the Russian advance, other NATO members are also supporting Ukraine with arms, training, and intelligence.\n\nAfter NATOs difficult exit from Afghanistan, the bloc has rediscovered its original mission: containing an expansionist Russia. One key difference this time is that NATO will coordinate more closely with Asian partners following the blocs designation of China as an adversary. The United States, through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the AUKUS partnership, and bilateral alliances in Asia, will lead a collective WestNorth America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and Singaporein seeking to contain both Russia and China simultaneously.\n\nIt will, however, become increasingly difficult to maintain Western unity in the face of growing hardship caused by the wars economic fallout, including Western sanctions and Russias weaponization of energy and food supplies. Washington will have to lead in helping its allies find alternatives to Russian oil and gas at the same time as it pursues a domestic agenda of phasing out fossil fuels.\n\nWashington grand strategic challenge is to ensure that a post-post-Cold War world will still have rules, especially those designed to avoid large-scale armed conflict.\n\nBut the United States will also confront a new reality. While the collective West has condemned and sanctioned Russia and backed Ukraine, almost the entire global south has refused to choose sides. India is a U.S. partner in the Quad but has neither criticized nor sanctioned Russiaand has increased its imports of Russian oil since the war began. China has neither backed nor condemned the Russian invasion but has supported Russias claims that its attack was provoked by threats to its security from NATO. Many other countries in the global south view Russia as a large authoritarian country with which they can do business and accuse the United States of hypocrisy, given Washingtons own past wars in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The United States will have to navigate this large nonaligned group of countries, much as it did during the Cold War: by seeking to persuade them that Russias invasion, by violating the U.N. Charter and international law, represents a threat to other nations sovereignty and territorial integrity as well.\n\nRussia and China have both called for a new post-Western order in which the United States can no longer set the agenda. Beijing seeks a global order where China can set the rules with the United States, but where there will still be rules. Russia, judging by its actions in Ukraine and its nightly television propaganda barrages, is promoting something else entirely: world disorder with no rules. The United States grand strategic challenge is to ensure that a post-post-Cold War world will indeed maintain rulesincluding, most importantly, those designed to avoid large-scale armed conflict.\n\nReturn to Full List\n\nFinally Wean Europe Off Washington\n\nBy Stephen M. Walt, a columnist at Foreign Policy and professor of international relations at Harvard University\n\nFinland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin (left) and Finland's President Sauli Niinist give a press conference to announce that Finland will apply for NATO membership at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland on May 15.\n\nWhen Foreign Policy first asked about the Ukraine wars impact on U.S. strategy five months ago, I argued that Russias illegal invasion of Ukraine was an ideal opportunity to start the process of weaning the United States European allies off their excessive dependence on U.S. protection. If anything, the case for a new division of labor has grown stronger since then.\n\nThe war has shown that hard power still matters in the 21st century, exposed Europes military shortcomings, subtly underscored the limits of the U.S. commitment, and revealed Russias enduring military limitations. Rebuilding Europes defenses will take time and money, but having Europe take greater responsibility for its own defense will allow the United States to shift more effort and attention to Asia to meet the many challenges posed by a more powerful and assertive China.\n\nUnfortunately, the Biden administration is ignoring these implications and reinforcing European dependence on Uncle Sam. If this course continues, the United States will remain overstretched, and its capacity to balance China effectively will suffer.\n\nWhat has happened over the past five months to bolster the case for weaning Europe off Washington?\n\nThe case for a new division of labor between the United States and Europe has only grown stronger since the start of the war.\n\nFirst, Russias military performance has not improved significantly, and its armed forces continue to suffer substantial losses. Even if Moscows greater latent power allows it to eke out some sort of Pyrrhic victory in Ukraine, its ability to threaten the rest of Europe in the future will be minimal. Russia has lost a sizable portion of its most sophisticated weaponry and best-trained military manpower. Western sanctions have damaged its economy significantly. Export restrictions will make it much harder for Russias defense industry to acquire the advanced semiconductors and other technologies that cutting-edge weaponry requires. Over time, European efforts to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas will deprive Moscow of revenues and further hamper its ability to rebuild its military forces once the fighting in Ukraine is over.\n\nSecond, Sweden and Finland have been welcomed into NATO. Unlike some of the blocs other new members, both countries have potent military forces, and their entry greatly complicates Russian defense planning by turning the Baltic Sea into a virtual NATO lake. This tilts the balance of power in Europe even more decisively in NATOs favor.\n\nThird, events in Asiasuch as the extensive Chinese military exercises that followed U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosis recent visit to Taiwanhave underscored the central role of U.S. power in preserving a favorable balance of power in Asia. If preventing the emergence of a rival hegemon in a vital strategic region remains a cardinal principle of U.S. grand strategy, then pivoting to Asia is essential, regardless of what happens in Ukraine.\n\nUnfortunately, the Biden administration may now be repeating the same errors that encouraged Washingtons European partners to neglect their own defense capabilities in the past. The United States has assumed primary responsibility for arming, training, subsidizing, and advising Ukraine. In February, the administration announced the open-ended deployment of 20,000 additional U.S. troops to Europe, with other new forces added in June. Unsurprisingly, European resolve to do more is waning, and long-engrained habits of free-riding are reemerging. The impending European recession will only exacerbate these tendencies, casting doubt on the bold pledges that Germany and other European states made a few months ago.\n\nIf this trend is not reversed, Washington will find itself doing more than is needed in Europe but not enough in Asia. For U.S. grand strategy, that would be a fundamental error.\n\nReturn to Full List\n\nBidens Pivot to Asia Was Right\n\nBy C. Raja Mohan, a columnist at Foreign Policy and a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute\n\nPeople visit the harbor where Taiwanese navy warships are anchored in Keelung, Taiwan, on Aug. 7. Taiwan remained tense after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited as part of a tour of Asia aimed at reassuring allies in the region. In response, China began conducting live-fire drills in waters close to those claimed by Taiwan.\n\nSix months after Russias invasion of Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Bidens prewar focus on the China challenge has turned out to be the right bet. Despite the unprecedented military crisis in Europe, the Biden administration has refused to take its eyes off Asia. Although the Russian invasion of Ukraine highlighted the dangers of Russian ambitions in Europe, Biden never discarded his conviction that Chinese expansionism in Asia poses the greater threat to the United States.\n\nThe poor performance of Moscows armed forces in Ukraine has demonstrated the limitations of Russian military power. Moscows inability to break Ukraines internal coherence, European unity, or trans-Atlantic solidarity underlines the Kremlins major strategic weaknesses in its confrontation with the West.\n\nIf the Ukraine conflict turns protracted, it is certainly possible that some or all of these factors could change and produce some gains for Russia. But a prolonged stalemate in Ukraine would also create new internal challenges for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Whatever the outcome, Russia can only come out a diminished power. If the task of simultaneously confronting both Russia and China was seen as an impossible one, Russian vulnerabilities should make it a less daunting one.\n\nThat brings us to the connection between the European and Asian theaters and the \"partnership without limits\" between Moscow and Beijing, which the two revisionist powers announced in early February. China has not been of much help to Russia in countering the West. But a Russia that inevitably comes out weaker from the Ukraine war could be even more dependent on China. Russia will also be under greater compulsion to support Chinese adventurism in Asia. This, in turn, will make it harder to counter Chinas power in Asia.\n\nLong-term stability in Europe and Asia will depend on Washingtons ability to build local balances of power and promote regional orders.\n\nThe escalating tensions over Taiwan in the wake of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosis visit to Taipei in early August are merely a reminder that the prospects for a U.S.-Chinese confrontation are growing in Asia. Unlike in Ukraine, where the West has refrained from any direct intervention, the United States will likely be drawn into a direct conflict with China over Taiwan. Any Asian sense of U.S. reluctance to resist Chinese hegemony will push more countries in the region to bandwagon with Beijing. Fortunately, the Biden administration continues to raise its game in Asia.\n\nEmpowering friends and allies in Europe and Asia to take greater responsibility for securing their own regions has been a major theme of Bidens policy. In Europe, it remains to be seen if all of the United States alliesespecially Germany and Franceare really committed to translating their commitments into actions. In Asia, Americas allies and partners such as Japan, South Korea, Australia, and India appear far more willing to take on a larger role in their own security and the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific. The Biden administration has devoted considerable diplomatic energies to preventing the growth of neutralism in the rest of Asia. But it is a work in progress.\n\nIt is no surprise that there are deep divisions in both Europe and Asia on how to deal with Russia and China. Preventing Moscow and Beijing from exploiting these divisions will remain a major political challenge for the United States as it tries to stabilize the two regions. The United States remains indispensable in balancing Russia in Europe and China in Asia. But long-term stability in Europe and Asia will depend on Washingtons ability to build local balances of power and promote regional orders.\n\nReturn to Full List\n\nA New Grand Bargain With Europe\n\nBy Liana Fix, the director of the international affairs program at the Krber Foundation\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (right) and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen make statements following their talks in Kyiv on June 11.\n\nSix months after Russias brutal invasion of Ukraine, two preliminary lessons can be drawn on how the war will affect the U.S. strategic outlook on Europe.\n\nThe first and obvious one is NATOs comeback from what French President Emmanuel Macron called \"brain death\" to the most important organization on the European continent. The war has reaffirmed the blocs centralityas well as the United States primacyfor European security.\n\nThis is unsurprising: A war launched by an adversary in its neighborhood gives a defense alliance every reason to reaffirm its raison dtre. What was surprising was the scale of NATOs revival, including two new members invited within a few months of the start of Russias war. Support for NATO has shot up among European publics, as have positive attitudes toward the U.S. role in Europe.\n\nMore remarkable than NATOs resurgence, however, is that the European Union has risen to the occasion. Instead of becoming marginalized at a time of war, the EU has become NATOs powerful cousin in the economic realm. Within days of the invasion, the EU transformed itself from an organization dedicated to peacetime economic cooperation to one willing and able to conduct economic warfare.\n\nIn part, this reflects the nature of this particular war: Because NATO and its partners are not fighting directly, their instruments are limited to military support for Ukraine and economic measures. The Wests economic warfare is therefore almost as important as its weapons deliveries and intelligence support. And economic measures are firmly the EUs terrain.\n\nThis points to a grand strategic bargain that joins the EUs economic power with the United States military might.\n\nThat said, economic warfare is a new business for the EU, which has more experience negotiating free trade agreements than organizing the entire blocs decoupling from a major trading partner. Instead of bringing economies closer togetherits usual roleBrussels has had to reverse the process and cut ties between Russia and the EU in many areas.\n\nEurope should, of course, do more. Its embargo on Russian oilmuch easier to do than replacing the Kremlins gaswill come into effect only in December. Meanwhile, EU countries continue to transfer huge amounts of money for Russian energy. But in the medium term, the Western sanctions regime will make it impossible for Russia to sustain a modern economy and will probably constrain its ability to conduct war.\n\nWhat does this mean for U.S. grand strategy? The United States should look beyond NATO when assessing Europes strategic importance.\n\nUntil Europeans can assume more responsibility for their own securitywhich is still a while off, if it ever happens at allthe economic realm is where they can be very powerful. Washington will need partners in the looming conflicts of the future, where China will be an economic as much as a security challenge. Since February, the EU has proved that it can be a reliable partner even at great cost to its own economy. This points to a grand strategic bargain that joins the EUs economic power with the United States military mightand will require Washington to stay more engaged in Europe than it had planned.\n\nOf course, China is in a whole other economic league from Russia, and Europeans will need convincing reasons to put their economic ties to China in jeopardy. Nonetheless, no one would have expected such a strong European response to Russia, and that response has very likely been noticed by the Chinese leadership. Moscows war has taught us that the same rules apply in economic warfare as in military warfare: No plan of operations can provide any certainty beyond the first encounter.\n\nReturn to Full List\n\nAn Emerging Atlantic-Pacific Partnership\n\nBy Robin Niblett, a distinguished fellow at Chatham House\n\nFighters take position off the South China Sea.\n\nIn the face of heroic Ukrainian resistance and essential international support for Kyiv, Russian leader Vladimir Putins brutal invasion of Ukraine is running out of steam. In contrast, the Biden administration has taken this opportunity to regain the United States strategic position as the linchpin of the worlds liberal democracies.\n\nHelped by Beijings decision to align itself with Moscow, Washington has stitched together a new Atlantic-Pacific partnership. This partnership links the United States commitments to European security against persistent Russian aggression with its commitments to its Asian allies against Chinas growing military assertiveness.\n\nThe presence of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea at the Madrid NATO summit in June showed that these countries understand that U.S. commitment to their security also requires their support for U.S. interests in Europe. And the first-ever reference to China as an explicit security challenge in the alliances summit communiqudespite the ongoing war in Europewas a signal that Europeans know they must take future threats from China seriously if they want the United States to remain a reliable ally in Europe.\n\nThe Biden team now needs to make this new trans-hemispheric partnership real and not a fleeting mirage. It should challenge European allies, some of which have issued ambitious Indo-Pacific strategies, to join regular freedom-of-navigation operations and military exercises in and around the South China Sea. The allies must also now work together to preserve freedom of navigation in the Taiwan Strait, following Beijings opportunistic use of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosis visit to Taiwan in early August to change the military status quo around the island.\n\nEuropeans know they must take future threats from China seriously if they want the United States to remain a reliable ally in Europe.\n\nIn addition, the G-7 should invite its close Pacific partners beyond Japan to be regular participants in the groups strategic dialogues, whether on sanctions policy, technology investment, or critical supply chains. Together, they would have the economic critical mass to agree on trade and investment standards that align with their values. If successful, other democracies could be invited to join this community.\n\nHowever, the United States needs to ensure that this moment does not presage a return to the divided world of the 20th century. While nurturing a new Atlantic-Pacific partnership is the priority, the other element of U.S. grand strategy should be to draw countries in Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere into a next tier of economic and strategic relationships that counterbalance Chinese and Russian efforts to do the same.\n\nIn the competition between Russia and China on the one hand and the Atlantic-Pacific partnership on the other, the 140 or so countries now composing a reprise of the Cold War eras nonaligned community have an agency they never possessed during the Cold War. This time, a \"with us or against us\" approach by the United States and its allies would be counterproductive. Instead, the material benefits that other countries gain from interaction with members of the new Atlantic-Pacific partnership should be calibrated to their commitment to pursuing shared interests and the efforts they undertake to improve domestic governance and protection of their citizens rights.\n\nThis strategy will require the Biden administration to develop a more inclusive approach to global leadership that its predecessors ever did. For their part, the United States allies must cross their fingers and hope that the next U.S. presidential election does not undo the achievements of the past six months.\n\nReturn to Full List\n\nFuture U.S. Success Requires a Ukrainian Victory\n\nBy Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the chairman of Rasmussen Global, a former NATO secretary general, and a former Danish prime minister\n\nUkrainian military vehicles move past Independence square in central Kyiv, Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRussias war in Ukraine has put territorial defense in Europe back at the top of the agenda. Watching a nuclear-armed state launch a full-scale invasion of a neighboring country finally seems to have concentrated minds in European capitals. Military budgets are being raised, Finland and Sweden are about to join NATO, and nations across the free world are coming to Ukraines aid. This has important ramifications for the United States strategic ambitions. As the divide between the worlds democracies and autocracies hardens, the world is entering a renewed period of competition and confrontation. The war has shown that Washington remains the ultimate guarantor of security in Europe. It has also demonstrated the need for the democratic world to unite in the face of increasingly aggressive autocracies.\n\nThe war has demonstrated the need for the democratic world to unite in the face of increasingly aggressive autocracies.\n\nThe United States main strategic focus remains the pivot to Asia and increased competition with China. However, that will be far more difficult if Washington is tied up with a long-running conflict in Europe. The best way to avoid this trap is by giving the Ukrainians everything they need to win this war. The West must then ensure that Russia never attacks it again. That is the aim of the working group I was asked to co-chair by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky alongside his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, on security guarantees for Ukraine. The groups work is still ongoing, but one point is already clear: The best deterrence against further Russian aggression is a militarily strong Ukraine. The United States and its allies therefore need to provide Ukraine with all it needs to defend its independence for the long term. If the West fails to do this, Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop in Ukraine.\n\nDictators everywhere are watching the conflict closely. So far, the United States has responded forcefully and led a powerful and unified response by the Western world. With a painful winter approaching, this unity will be tested. The West must redouble its efforts to ensure Ukraine wins both the war and the subsequent peace. If it fails in this, autocrats everywhere will be the ones cheering.\n\nReturn to Full List\n\nEconomic Warfare Must Be Tempered to Win Allies\n\nBy Edward Alden, a columnist at Foreign Policy, a visiting professor at Western Washington University, and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations\n\nProtesters demonstrate against rising energy prices outside Ofgem's headquarters in Canary Wharf on Aug. 26 in London, England.\n\nFor many decades, economic influence was central to the United States grand strategybut only as the soft edge of U.S. power. Successive administrations largely followed the economic orthodoxy of free trade, foreign investment, and open markets, believing a global system governed by such rules would serve U.S. national interests while enriching much of the world.\n\nBut with Russias invasion of Ukraine, the United States has thrown this rulebook out the window. Led by the Biden administration, the West has imposed harsh economic sanctions against Russia that are likely to remain in place for years. With an eye toward national security, Congress has embraced a full-blown industrial policy, passing the CHIPS and Science Act to bolster the countrys manufacturing capabilities in semiconductors and other critical sectors. The policys explicit goal is to reduce dependence on imports from China and other potentially hostile powers. Beijing, in turn, has doubled down on its own efforts to achieve greater self-sufficiency, not least to ward off any future sanctions in the event of, say, a war over Taiwan. Russia, too, has joined the economic struggle: It hopes to weaken Europes support for Ukraine by choking off gas supplies, even at huge cost to Russias own economic growth.\n\nThese actions would suggest a future of economic conflict among the great powers, with the United States and its allies hoping their technological leadership will provide the decisive edge. But there is one problem with this strategy: The rest of the world wants no part of economic warfare. Already, most countries outside the Western bloc have refused to choose sides over Ukraine or join the sanctions regime. India might be inching toward alignment with the West in the Indo-Pacific, but it has gorged on discounted Russian oil. Saudi Arabia has continued to embrace Russia as part of the OPEC+ oil producers cartel, rejecting U.S. calls to expel Moscow from the club. Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America are largely focused on their own economic aspirationsand managing food shortages and inflation exacerbated by the war. Indonesia has refused Western calls to expel Russia from the G-20 summit it is hosting in November, and both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping say they will attend. \"The rivalry of the big countries is indeed worrying,\" Indonesian President Joko Widodo told Bloomberg News. \"What we want for this region is to be stable, peaceful, so that we can build economic growth.\"\n\nFor U.S. strategy to succeed, Washington will have to temper its economic actions against great-power rivals in order to curry favor among the less committed.\n\nFor U.S. strategy to succeed, then, Washington will have to temper its economic actions against great-power rivals in order to curry favor among the less committed. U.S. President Joe Bidens cap-in-hand visit to Saudi Arabia in July to plead for greater oil production and his administrations reluctance to criticize India over its Russian oil purchases are just two examples of this delicate balance. Biden has also shown no signs he will boycott the G-20 summit to protest Putins presence, even though U.S. Treasury officials walked out of a preparatory meeting earlier this year.\n\nUnlike during the Cold War, when only the West had the wealth and institutions to offer significant economic carrots, the United States now faces fierce competition. China and even Russia have much to offer. China has the full suite of a large market hungry for commodities and other inputs, ample cash for foreign investments and loans, and low-cost manufactured exports. Russia mostly has cheap resources but some, such as oil and fertilizer, are vital for many developing countries. The United States and its allies will need to show they can apply their new focus on economic statecraft to the immediate challenges these countries facefor example, by offering food aid and debt forgiveness as needed and keeping Western markets open to trade. The economic pillar of a new U.S. grand strategy will only succeed if it offers tangible gains for the not-so-great powers.\n\nReturn to Full List",

We will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\n\nWe continue to condemn the brutal, unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine by Russia and aided by Belarus. Russias war of aggression is causing global economic disruptions and is threatening the security of the global supply of energy and food. The economic costs of the war and consequent price increases are felt disproportionately by vulnerable groups across all economies and particularly by those countries already facing food insecurities and fiscal challenges.\n\nWe underscore our shared commitment to our determined and coordinated sanctions imposed in response to Russias war of aggression, which are already having a considerable impact on the Russian economy. The cumulative impact of these measures on Russia will amplify over time and starkly deteriorate its economic potential. We remain committed to fully implementing and enforcing our sanctions and remain vigilant against sanctions evasion, circumvention and backfilling.\n\nAt their summit in Elmau, G7 Leaders reaffirmed a shared commitment to preventing Russia from profiting from its war of aggression, to supporting stability in global energy markets and to minimising negative economic spillovers, especially on low- and middle-income countries. To deliver on this commitment, today we confirm our joint political intention to finalise and implement a comprehensive prohibition of services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally the provision of such services would only be allowed if the oil and petroleum products are purchased at or below a price (\"the price cap\") determined by the broad coalition of countries adhering to and implementing the price cap.\n\nThe price cap is specifically designed to reduce Russian revenues and Russias ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russias war on global energy prices, particularly for low and middle-income countries, by only permitting service providers to continue to do business related to Russian seaborne oil and petroleum products sold at or below the price cap. This measure would thus build on and amplify the reach of existing sanctions, notably the EUs sixth package of sanctions, ensuring coherence through a strong global framework.[1] We welcome the decision of the European Union to explore with international partners ways to curb rising energy prices, including the feasibility of introducing temporary import price caps.\n\nIn line with our extensive and ongoing engagement with a diverse group of countries and key stakeholders, we invite all countries to provide input on the price caps design and to implement this important measure. We seek to establish a broad coalition in order to maximise effectiveness and urge all countries that still seek to import Russian oil and petroleum products to commit to doing so only at prices at or below the price cap. We reaffirm our own measures to phase out Russian oil and products from our domestic markets and underscore that the price cap measure aims to relieve pressure on global oil prices and support oil-importing countries globally by enabling continued access to Russian oil at or below the price cap for countries that continue such imports. The measure has the potential to be particularly beneficial to countries, notably vulnerable low- and middle-income countries, suffering from high energy and food prices, aggravated by Russias war of aggression. We will also develop targeted mitigation mechanisms alongside our restrictive measures to ensure that the most vulnerable and impacted countries maintain access to energy markets including from Russia.\n\nWe commit to urgently work on the finalisation and implementation of this measure in our own jurisdictions through our respective domestic and legal processes and with our partners. We acknowledge that, for the EU, unanimity among the 27 EU Member States is required. We aim to align implementation with the timeline of related measures within the EUs sixth sanctions package.\n\nThe initial price cap will be set at a level based on a range of technical inputs and will be decided by the full coalition in advance of implementation in each jurisdiction. The price cap will be publicly communicated in a clear and transparent manner. The price caps effectiveness and impact will be closely monitored and the price level revisited as necessary.\n\nWe envisage that practical implementation of the price cap will be based on a recordkeeping and attestation model covering all relevant types of contracts. We aim to ensure consistent implementation across jurisdictions. In implementation, we would aim to limit possibilities for circumventing the price cap regime, while at the same time minimising the administrative burden for market participants. With a view to final design and implementation, we will continue to engage with a diverse group of countries and stakeholders to enhance clarity and compliance and enable trade to continue to flow at or below the envisaged price cap. We envisage that the coalition establishes a cooperation framework across jurisdictions to ensure compliance and enable monitoring and supervision. Once operational, the coalition may consider further action to ensure the effectiveness of the price cap. The price cap measure will be reviewed and reconsidered when appropriate.\n\nIn line with G7 Leaders commitments at Elmau, we continue to encourage oil-producing countries to increase their production to decrease volatility in energy markets, and in this context welcome OPECs recent decisions to increase output amid tight supply conditions. We call on them to continue action in this regard. We will increase coordination with partners committed to bolstering efficiency, stability and transparency in energy markets.\n\nChancellor welcomes the G7 Finance Ministers statement on Russias war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer, Nadhim Zahawi said:\n\nSince Putins brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine the UK and our allies have imposed hugely damaging sanctions on the Kremlin war machine, pushing the Russian economy into a deep recession and putting the majority of Russias $640billion foreign exchange reserves beyond use. Following a productive meeting with Secretary Janet Yellen in Washington, and together with our G7 partners, we have agreed to go further. This has been a personal priority for me as Chancellor. We will curtail Putins capacity to fund his war from oil exports by banning services, such as insurance and the provision of finance, to vessels carrying Russian oil above an agreed price cap. We are united against this barbaric aggression and will do all we can to support Ukraine as they fight for sovereignty, democracy and freedom.\n\n[1] The EUs sixth sanctions package was adopted on 3 June 2022.

Russia blames those sanctions for causing the gas supply problems, which it puts down to pipeline faults.\n\nAs tensions rose, Putin said contracts could be ripped up in the event of price caps and warned the West it risked being frozen like a wolf's tail in a famous Russian fairy tale. read more\n\nThe EU however plans to press ahead with a price cap on Russian gas and also a ceiling on the price paid for electricity from generators that do not run on gas. read more\n\nEU energy ministers are due to hold an emergency meeting on Friday.\n\n\"We will propose a price cap on Russian gas... We must cut Russia's revenues which Putin uses to finance this atrocious war in Ukraine,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters.\n\nThe Netherlands, which has consistently opposed a gas price cap, would support one that targets Russian gas, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, a Czech minister said earlier it should be taken off the agenda for Friday's meeting. The Czechs are helping to guide discussions as holders of the EU's rotating presidency.\n\nNO SUPPLIES\n\nPutin had anticipated the move and said Russia would hit back.\n\n\"We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests,\" Putin said at an economic forum in Vladivostok.\n\n\"We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil - we will not supply anything,\" Putin said. He also questioned a United Nations-brokered deal to export grain from Ukraine.\n\nEurope usually imports about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia.\n\nEurelectric, a body representing the European electricity industry, also criticised plans for an EU cap of 200 euros per megawatt hour on the price of electricity from generators that do not run on gas.\n\n\"The root cause of the problem is a shortage of gas supply and our addiction to imported fossil fuels. Governments should seek to tackle this rather than resorting to distortive, ad-hoc interventions in the electricity market,\" said Kristian Ruby, Secretary General of Eurelectric.\n\nHowever, European utilities stocks rallied on the news with analysts viewing the level of the cap as a better than expected outcome for the industry.\n\nThe energy crisis facing Europe has grown more acute after Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) fully suspended gas supplied through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany after it said it found an engine oil leak during maintenance work last week.\n\nThe Russian president said Germany and Western sanctions affecting the supply of parts were to blame for the pipeline not being operational.\n\nThe impact of the surge in prices is forcing companies to curtail production and governments to spend billions on support to cushion consumers from the impact.\n\nNew British Prime Minister Liz Truss is expected to unveil her plans on Thursday, with the bill from a price freeze forecast to rise towards 100 billion pounds. read more\n\nReporting by Reuters Writing by Keith Weir, Editing by William Maclean and Carmel Crimmins\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/Alexandros Avramidis Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nSummary\n\nCompanies High prices expected to continue this year and next\n\nRising wholesale energy costs passed on to consumers\n\nSept 2 - A global surge in wholesale power and gas prices means households across Europe face much higher energy bills this year and beyond, with the region's most vulnerable exposed to fuel poverty, consumer groups say.\n\nWHY THE HIGH PRICES?\n\nEnergy companies pay a wholesale price to buy the gas and electricity they sell to consumers. As in any market, this can go up or down, driven by supply and demand.\n\nTypically, prices rise in response to higher demand for heating and lighting in winter, and fall in summer.\n\nPrices started to rise above historically normal levels last September and have soared further following supply disruption linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24.\n\nJust before the war started, the German government halted the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would have doubled the amount of Russian gas shipped to Europe.\n\nIn July, Russia cut volumes pumped through Nord Stream 1 to 20% of capacity, citing maintenance issues, in what the German government said was a pretext used by Moscow to hit back against Western sanctions.\n\nOn Friday, Russia has scrapped a Saturday deadline to resume flows via Nord Stream 1 to Germany, deepening Europe's difficulties in securing winter fuel, after saying it had found faults in the pipeline during maintenance.\n\nNord Stream 1, which runs under the Baltic Sea, had been due to resume operating after a three-day halt for maintenance.\n\nFrench nuclear outages and a heatwave across Europe this summer have also boosted demand.\n\nBenchmark European gas prices at the Dutch TTF hub have risen by nearly 350% year on year, while German and French front-year power contracts have leapt by 540% and 790% respectively.\n\nHOW LONG COULD THIS LAST?\n\nMany gas market analysts expect prices to remain elevated for the next two years or more.\n\nGlobal competition for gas and coal this winter is expected to prevent prices from falling. Any more disruption to Russian gas supply, such as a full stoppage through Nord Stream 1, would support prices.\n\nAlthough European countries are on track to refill gas storage sites to a minimum level of 80% by Oct. 1, an extra cold winter could deplete those reserves quickly.\n\nWHY RETAIL PRICE RISES?\n\nMany energy suppliers pass on higher wholesale costs to consumers through their retail tariffs. In Britain, for example, on a dual fuel bill (electricity and gas), the wholesale cost can account for 40% of the total.\n\nSuppliers can buy energy on the wholesale market on the day of delivery, a day ahead and up to months or seasons in advance, as they try to predict when prices will be lower and how much to purchase to cover their customer needs.\n\nIf suppliers do not buy enough energy, they might have to buy more at a price that could be higher, depending on market movements.\n\nGOVERNMENT ACTION\n\nThe European Union in July asked its member states to reduce gas demand voluntarily by 15% this winter with the possible introduction of mandatory cuts.\n\nSeveral European governments had already taken measures to drive consumption down before the announcement, such as laws on air conditioning and heating levels in public and commercial buildings.\n\nGermany has moved to the second stage of a three-tier emergency gas plan. The third stage envisages supply being curtailed to industry.\n\nIt will also introduce a gas levy to distribute the high costs of replacing Russian gas among all end-consumers from October but this could see German energy bills rise by another 480 euros ($489.46) a year.\n\nGovernments have also announced measures such as subsidies, removing environmental levies or VAT from bills and price caps.\n\nBritain, which relies heavily on gas for heating, introduced a price cap on the most widely-used energy tariffs in 2019 that sets a maximum charge per unit of energy and limits suppliers' profits to 1.9%.\n\nHowever, the cap is estimated to rise to over 4,200 pounds($5,075.28) a year in January, up 230% on the year before.\n\nWHAT CAN CONSUMERS DO?\n\nHouseholds account for 30%-40% of Europe's gas demand. Some 80% of household gas demand is from heating while the rest is from hot water and cooking.\n\nUsually demand is higher in the winter gas season, which runs from October to March.\n\nAccording to Bernstein analysts, certain measures by households could reduce household gas demand by a third.\n\nTurning a thermostat down by 1 degree to 19 degrees Celsius from 20C could reduce household gas demand by around 7%. Lowering the temperature by another one degree could reduce household gas demand by a further 7%.\n\nWearing a thick jumper at home during the winter season could deliver another 4% saving in household demand.\n\nDelaying putting on the heating to November from October and/or stopping heating by February rather than March could save 3%-6%. Turning radiators off in unused rooms, replacing shower heads with water efficient ones and only using boilers twice a day could save a further 7% of demand.\n\nIn Britain, the \"Don't Pay UK\" campaign is calling for a reduction in energy bills to an affordable level and urges people to cancel their direct debit energy payments from October.\n\n($1 = 0.9807 euros)\n\n($1 = 0.8275 pounds)\n\nReporting by Nina Chestney; Editing by Barbara Lewis and Alexander Smith\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Pool photo by Sergei Bobelyv\n\nAs his forces struggle in Ukraine and his economy strains under sanctions, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia struck a defiant tone on Wednesday, arguing that the West had failed in its \"economic, financial and technological aggression\" against Russia and that his country had only gained from the global furor over his invasion.\n\n\"We have not lost anything and will not lose anything,\" Mr. Putin said at an economic conference in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok.\n\nMr. Putins statement was dismissive of the human losses Russia has faced in the grueling campaign since he launched an invasion in February. His own Defense Ministry has acknowledged hundreds of deaths, although that total has not been updated in months. Western estimates are far higher: The United States estimated last month that 80,000 Russian soldiers had been killed or wounded in the war.\n\nMr. Putin also said that he would meet next week with an increasingly important ally, President Xi Jinping of China, as the Russian leader tries to expand economic ties with Asia to counteract the effects of Western penalties. And he insisted that the invasion, now in its seventh month, had raised Moscows international stature and that a crackdown on dissent was cleansing Russia of \"harmful\" elements, including journalists who have left the country since the conflict began.\n\n\"Of course, a certain polarization is taking place both in the world and within the country but I believe that this will only be beneficial,\" Mr. Putin said. \"Because everything that is unnecessary, harmful and everything that prevents us from moving forward will be rejected.\"\n\nHe also reasserted his interpretation of the war in Ukraine as the culmination of efforts to subvert an unjust world order led by the United States, saying that Western countries were \"striving to maintain a former world order that is beneficial only to them.\"\n\nMr. Putins remarks came as his forces face an increasingly difficult situation at the front lines in Ukraine, where they have been unable to capture a major town for more than two months. Ukraine is mounting a counteroffensive that its officials contend is showing initial signs of success.\n\n\"All of our actions aim to help people who live in Donbas,\" Mr. Putin said, referring to the region of eastern Ukraine that his forces have sought to conquer, vowing to fulfill this \"duty to the end.\"\n\nThe Russian president sought to radiate confidence that the Wests efforts to isolate Moscow were doomed to fail. Participating in an onstage panel with the leader of Myanmar and the prime minister of Mongolia, and with the third-highest-ranking member of the Chinese Communist Party, he indicated that Russia could shift its trade flows toward Asia.\n\n\"No matter how much someone wants to isolate Russia, it is impossible to do,\" Mr. Putin said. \"You just need to look at the map.\"\n\nMr. Putin said that Russias currency and financial markets had been stabilized, inflation had been tamed and unemployment had been kept to \"record lows.\" Yet his rosy pronouncements have been tempered by his own economic policymakers, who say that it will take years for Russias economy to rebound to prewar levels and that its growth will be hampered as long as Western sanctions are in place. Many analysts also predict further shocks as European countries press ahead with plans to sharply reduce purchases of Russian oil by the end of the year.\n\nMr. Putin used part of his speech to question a rare example of cooperation between Russia and Ukraine: a U.N.-brokered deal to allow the export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea.\n\nHe accused Western countries of \"cheating\" by diverting ships away from the worlds poorest countries, offering no evidence for that claim. Mr. Putin said that he would consult with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about amending the terms of the deal to limit the flow of grain to Western states.\n\nU.S. officials called Mr. Putins comments misleading, saying that huge amounts of grain were reaching needy countries outside of Europe. Last week, a World Food Program ship carrying 23,300 metric tons of Ukrainian grain arrived in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, and a second ship carrying 37,000 metric tons departed for Yemen.\n\nOne senior U.S. official said Mr. Putins remarks could be read as the Russian leaders latest effort to drive a wedge between Western countries and developing nations in the global south, potentially to create more pressure for an end to the fighting on terms favorable to Moscow.\n\nMichael Crowley contributed reporting.",

Europe usually imports about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia.\n\nSince the war began, European Union customers have pledged to reduce their reliance on Russian energy while Russia has cut or shut down supplies on three of its biggest westward gas pipelines while oil supplies have been redirected eastwards.\n\nRussia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) has for years been studying the possibility for a major new gas pipeline - the Power of Siberia 2 - to travel through Mongolia taking Russian gas to China.\n\nThe proposed pipeline could carry 50 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas a year, Gazprom says - slightly less than the Nord Stream 1, the currently shutdown pipeline which links Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe existing Power of Siberia pipeline, which runs from Russia to China, was launched at the end of 2019 with an annual capacity of 61 bcm per year.\n\nReporting by Reuters; editing by Guy Faulconbridge\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Read more\n\nBERLIN Finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial powers on Friday pledged to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil in a bid to limit the Kremlins revenues and ability to fund its war in Ukraine, while also curtailing the wars impact on energy prices and inflation.\n\nThe ministers said they would impose the cap by barring insurance or shipping companies from helping Russia sell oil at prices above the set limit.\n\nThe decision follows discussions at the groups summit earlier this year and aims at solving one of the vexing problems with sanctions against Russia: Global oil prices have risen on fears of restricted supply, which has only fattened the Kremlins take.\n\nMeanwhile, skyrocketing energy prices have fed inflation that is squeezing consumers in rich and poor countries alike and threatens to push Europe into recession.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement issued by Germany, which chairs the G-7 this year, the ministers said they \"confirm our joint political intention to finalize and implement a comprehensive prohibition of services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally.\"\n\nProviding those services \"would only be allowed if the oil and petroleum products are purchased at or below a price (the price cap) determined by the broad coalition of countries adhering to and implementing the price cap,\" they added.\n\nThe statement did not give any proposed figure for a potential price cap and also did not specify when the G-7 aims to finalize the plan. It said that \"we invite all countries to provide input on the price caps design and to implement this important measure,\" calling for a \"broad coalition in order to maximize effectiveness.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at a Friday briefing that in the upcoming weeks the administration will announce the price cap level, coalition partners and guidance for market participants.\n\nThe G-7 is made up of the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan.\n\nWhen they met in June in Germany, G-7 leaders agreed to explore a price cap but said the idea needed further discussion, a testimony to the complexity of implementing it.\n\nThe measure pushed by U.S. President Joe Biden could work because the service providers are mostly located in the European Union or the U.K. and thus within reach of sanctions. To be effective, however, it would have to involve as many importing countries as possible, in particular India where refiners have been snapping up cheap Russian oil shunned by Western traders.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak has said Russia will refuse to sell oil to countries or companies that observe the cap.\n\nThe U.S. has already blocked Russian oil imports, which were small in any case. The European Union has decided to impose a ban on the 90% of Russian oil that comes by sea, but that does not take effect until the end of the year.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the G-7 had taken \"a critical step forward\" and that \"todays action will help deliver a major blow (to) Russian finances and will both hinder Russias ability to fight its unprovoked war in Ukraine and hasten the deterioration of the Russian economy.\"\n\n\"We have already begun to see the impact of the price cap through Russias hurried attempts to negotiate bilateral oil trades at massive discounts,\" Yellen said in a statement.\n\nA senior U.S. Treasury official, insisting on anonymity to discuss the strategic thinking, said the caps would create a new baseline price for countries such as China and India that are not part of the coalition that purchase oil from Russia. Lower prices paid to Russia by these nations would accomplish the coalitions goal, said the official, who added that Russia is aggressively trying to lock in long-term contracts now to limit the loss of potential oil revenues.\n\nFridays G-7 statement said the group encourages other oil-producing countries to increase production in order to decrease volatility in energy markets.",

It did not give a new time frame.\n\nHowever, Siemens Energy, which normally services Nord Stream 1 turbines, said such a leak should not stop the pipeline from operating. It also said the Portovaya compressor station, where the leak was discovered, has other turbines for Nord Stream to keep operating.\n\n\"Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure within the scope of maintenance work,\" the company said.\n\nMoscow has blamed sanctions, imposed by the West after Russia invaded Ukraine, for hampering routine operations and maintenance of Nord Stream 1. Brussels says this is a pretext and Russia is using gas as an economic weapon to retaliate.\n\n\"This is part of Russias psychological war against us,\" tweeted Michael Roth, chair of the German parliamentary foreign affairs committee.\n\nSiemens Energy said it is not currently contracted to carry out maintenance work on the line, but is on standby.\n\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said earlier the EU should impose a price cap on Russian pipeline gas to foil what she said were President Vladimir Putins attempts to manipulate the market.\n\nRussia has denied previous allegations of using gas as an economic weapon or manipulating the gas market.\n\nThe United States and Europe were collaborating to ensure enough energy supplies were available, a spokesperson for the White Houses National Security Council said on Friday.\n\n\"It is unfortunately not surprising that Russia continues to use energy as a weapon against European consumers,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nWholesale gas prices have rocketed 400% since August 2021, hurting European industry and households as demand recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic and because of the Ukraine crisis.\n\n\"We see that the electricity market does not work anymore because it is massively disrupted due to Putins manipulations,\" Von der Leyen said, adding that a gas price cap on Russian pipeline supplies could be proposed at the European level.\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow would turn off supplies to Europe if Brussels imposed such a cap.\n\n\"There will simply be no Russian gas in Europe,\" he wrote on the Telegram app in response to Von der Leyen.\n\nRussia says it will stop selling oil to countries that set price caps The Kremlin said on Friday (2 September) that Russia would stop selling oil to countries that impose price caps on Russias energy resources caps that Moscow said would lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market.\n\nReduced deliveries via Nord Stream, alongside lower gas flows via Ukraine, another major route, have already left European states struggling to refill storage tanks for winter and prompted many to trigger emergency plans that could lead to energy rationing and stoking concerns about recession.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesman Eric Mamer wrote on Twitter that Gazprom had acted under \"fallacious pretences\" to shut down Nord Stream 1. \"Its also proof of Russias cynicism, as it prefers to flare gas instead of honouring contracts.\"\n\nGroup of Seven finance ministers agreed on Friday to put a price cap on Russian oil exports. Moscow said it would halt oil sales to countries imposing the cap, adding that the move would destabilize oil markets. Russia is the worlds biggest exporter of crude and fuel combined.\n\nRussian oil price cap wins G7 support, but level still to be determined G7 finance ministers on Friday (2 September) agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil to slash Moscows revenues while keeping crude flowing and avoiding price spikes, but specifics were not defined.\n\nBetter prepared\n\nGermanys network regulator said the country was more ready to cope with a disruption to Russian supplies, but households and companies had to cut energy consumption.\n\n\"Its good that Germany is now better prepared, but now its down to each and everyone,\" Klaus Mueller, president of the Bundesnetzagentur, said on Twitter.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested earlier on Friday there could be more disruptions to deliveries via Nord Stream 1.\n\n\"Its not the fault of Gazprom that the resources are missing. Therefore, the reliability of the entire system is at risk,\" he said when asked if more outages could be expected.\n\nGazprom Chief Executive Alexei Miller said on Wednesday that sanctions meant Siemens could not carry out regular maintenance.\n\nEU governments have been preparing for the possibility that Russia stops deliveries completely, after Gazprom first reduced flows in June and then again in July.\n\nThis weeks maintenance was announced at short notice.\n\nGermany, which is particularly reliant on Russian supplies, has been racing to fill its storage tanks before winter. That storage is now nearly 85% full, but Berlin says reaching a 95% target by 1 November will be tough unless companies and households use less fuel.\n\nThe EU has exceeded its 80% target for storage to be full by 1 October, ready for when heating usage picks up, but that may not sustain Europe through the winter if Russia keeps the taps closed.\n\nSome energy-intensive European companies, such as fertiliser and aluminium producers, have already cut output due to sky-high power prices, while some domestic consumers have reined in usage to save on escalating energy bills.\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

This restoration is also significant considering the plant's contribution to Ukraine's annual electricity production and the fact that it had been relying on a reserve line for power supply after losing its last main power line (3, 5).",

Nuclear power plants like Zaporizhzhia require constant water pumping through their cores for safe operation, which needs electricity usually supplied by high-voltage lines (2). The restoration of the transmission line was vital as Zaporizhzhia accounts for nearly half of the electricity generated by Ukraine's nuclear power plants and one-fifth of the country's annual electricity production (3). Despite losing its link to the last remaining main power line, the plant still managed to supply power to Ukraine's grid through a reserve line (5).",
                "more_detailed": "The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, the largest nuclear complex in Europe, had its last operating reactor shut down after the restoration of a transmission line linking the plant to Ukraine's power system (1). The plant, which accounts for nearly half of the total electricity generated by Ukraine's nuclear power plants and one-fifth of the country's annual electricity production, was \"completely shut down\" after the plant's number 6 power unit was disconnected from the grid, and arrangements for its cooling and transfer to a cold state were initiated (1,3). This restoration was crucial as the facility had been operating in an \"island mode,\" generating electricity and using its own energy to power cooling systems, which are essential for the safe functioning of nuclear power plants (1,2).\n\nThe plants' power was previously supplied by four high-voltage lines, which connected the nuclear complex to Ukraine's electricity grid. However, these lines were systematically cut due to the ongoing conflict, with the last 750kV line severed in early September, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (2). Despite the disconnection from its last external power line, the ZNPP managed to supply electricity to the grid through a reserve line (3). The IAEA announced the restoration of the second reserve power transmission line, which is a critical component for the plant's safety and operational systems (4). Without the restoration of the transmission line, the ZNPP would have had to rely on its generators, which can only run for a limited time in an emergency, signaling a potential threat of a nuclear meltdown if the generators had failed (10)."

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that the last external power line to the plant has been cut, though the plant continues to supply electricity through a reserve line (2). The head of the U.N. atomic watchdog has called for an immediate safety zone around the plant to prevent a nuclear disaster, with the plant currently under Russian control but being operated by Ukrainian staff (3). The shelling around the plant has been condemned by international authorities, with the IAEA refraining from assigning blame but insisting the shelling must cease immediately (4).",
                "more_detailed": "The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest, has been under the control of Russian forces since the early days of the conflict, but is still operated by Ukrainian staff (3,6,10). Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of dangerous shelling around the plant, which has led to significant damage to its critical infrastructure and has raised fears of a potential nuclear disaster (1,2,4,5,7,8,10). The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that the plant has been disconnected from its last external power line and is now relying on a reserve line to supply power to Ukraine's grid (2,7). Furthermore, a backup power line that would supply the plant in case of an emergency has also been damaged (6).\n\nIn response to the ongoing crisis, the head of the U.N. atomic watchdog, the IAEA, called for the immediate establishment of a safety zone around the plant to prevent a nuclear accident (3). The IAEA also maintains a permanent presence at the plant, with its Director General having personally visited the site to assess the situation (6,8). Despite the calls for a halt in the shelling, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu accused Ukraine of continuing to shell the plant, thereby increasing the risk of a nuclear catastrophe (5). The IAEA, however, has not attributed the shelling to either Russia or Ukraine, insisting that it must stop immediately (4). These developments have led to accusations that Russia's threats violate the 1973 bilateral Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War (9)."

The shelling has led to a complete power blackout with no running water, power or sewage in the city. Without confidence in the restoration of offsite power, the operator is considering shutting down the only remaining operating reactor meaning the whole plant would be fully reliant on emergency diesel generators, he explained. Grossi again called for the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. Ukraine and Russia have repeatedly traded accusations for who is responsible for the shelling.

Experts say its reactors are designed to protect against natural disasters and incidents such as aircraft crashes, but leaders around the world have appealed for it to be spared in the fighting because of the huge risk of a catastrophe.\n\nPlant operator Energoatom said in a statement that Russian forces have kept up \"intensive shelling\" of the area around Zaporizhzhia in recent days despite the warnings.\n\nThe IAEA, which still has two experts at the plant after a perilous inspection last week that required six inspectors to travel through the fighting, said last Saturday that the plant had lost its last main line to the grid, but was still sending power to the grid through a reserve line.\n\nThe developments at Zaporizhzhia came on the eve of a report to the U.N. Security Council by the IAEA inspectors about what they found on their visit.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have traded accusations about endangering the plant, which the Kremlins forces have held since early March. The plants Ukrainian staff continue to operate it.\n\nThe Russian military had earlier Monday accused Ukrainian forces of staging \"provocations\" at the plant, which lies within a Russian-installed administrative area.\n\nRussias Defense Ministry claimed that Kyivs forces on Sunday targeted the territory of the plant with a drone, which it said Russian troops were able to shoot down.\n\nThe ministry said Ukrainian troops also shelled the adjacent city of Enerhodar twice overnight.\n\nUkrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on Facebook on Monday that fighting around the power station made it impossible to repair damaged power lines, putting the world \"once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster.\"\n\nUkraines presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, applauded the IAEAs decision to leave some experts at the plant.\n\n\"There are Russian troops now who dont understand whats happening, dont assess the risks correctly,\" Podolyak said.\n\n\"There is a number of our workers there, who need some kind of protection, people from the international community standing by their side and telling (Russian troops): Dont touch these people, let them work,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior Kremlin official blamed Western sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine for stoppages in Moscows supply of natural gas to Europe.\n\nIn some of the bluntest comments yet on the standoff between Moscow and Western Europe over energy supplies, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said problems with pumping the gas occurred \"because of the sanctions.\"\n\n\"Other reasons that would cause problems with the pumping dont exist,\" Peskov claimed.\n\nThe sanctions on Moscow and Russian companies have created problems with equipment maintenance, he said, though that claim has been refuted by Western governments and engineers.\n\nRussian energy company Gazprom announced Friday that a suspension of gas supplies heading westwards through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline would be extended indefinitely because oil leaks in turbines need fixing.\n\nThat move brought a surge in European natural gas prices and walloped global stock markets.\n\nHigh energy prices and possible shortages this winter in Western Europe have set alarm bells ringing among governments, notably those in the European Union.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Monday called for a 10% cut in his countrys energy use in coming weeks and months to avoid the risk of rationing and cuts this winter.\n\nPeskov laid the blame for the disruption firmly at the door of the sanctions, which he claimed have prevented machinery from working properly, even though experts say that isnt true.\n\nGerman officials have rejected those explanations, saying they are merely a political power play. Germanys Siemens Energy, which manufactured turbines the Nord Stream 1 pipeline uses, said turbine leaks can be fixed while gas continues to flow through the pipeline.\n\nElsewhere, the fighting raged on for a seventh month, with Ukraines presidential office saying Monday at least four civilians were killed and seven others were wounded by new Russian shelling across several regions of Ukraine.\n\nIn the eastern city of Sloviansk, personnel at the Ukrainian Red Cross Society swept up debris Monday from a second rocket attack on its premises in a week.\n\nNobody was hurt in either attack, said Taras Logginov, head of the agencys rapid response unit. He blamed Russia forces and accused them of war crimes for the attacks.\n\nIn a row of apartment buildings across the road, the few residents who havent evacuated sawed sheets of plywood to board up their shattered windows.\n\nHenadii Sydorenko sat on the porch of his apartment building for a break. He said hes not sure whether to stay or leave, torn between his responsibility of taking care of three apartments whose owners have already evacuated and the increasing fear because of the now frequent shelling of Sloviansk.\n\n\"Its frightening,\" the 57-year-old said of the shelling. \"Im losing my mind, little by little.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyivs forces had liberated three settlements two in the south and one in the east, in the Donetsk region. He didnt provide names of the settlements in his comments on Sunday night.\n\nAmid increased Ukrainian strikes on the occupied Kherson region, Russian-installed authorities there said early Monday that for security reasons they were putting on hold their plans for a local referendum on whether the region should formally become part of Russia.\n\nBut by the afternoon, officials had a change of heart and said the ballot would go ahead as planned, though no date has been set.",

All times EDT.\n\n10:27 p.m.: American B-52 bombers flew low over Stockholm's parliament and palace on Friday as Sweden ramps up exercises with the United States in view of the Scandinavian country's application to join NATO.\n\nWhile the U.S. bombers have taken part in exercises in Sweden before, it was the first time they have flown over the capital, a military spokesperson, Therese Fagerstedt, told Agence France-Presse.\n\nSweden and Finland applied to join the Atlantic alliance in May following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The US and other Western powers have since intensified military exercises and shows of military might across the region.\n\n9:05 p.m.: G-20 energy talks in Bali ended Friday with the world's leading economies pledging to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy, Agrence France-Presse reported, but there was no binding agreement as officials struggle to overcome discord over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe non-binding \"Bali Compact\", which lists principles for achieving net zero emissions, was agreed by all members, Indonesian energy minister Arifin Tasrif said.\n\nDetails were not released but the minister said the plan seeks to strengthen national energy planning and implementation to improve energy security, efficiency and boost investment and financing.\n\n8 p.m.: Russian ex-president Dmitry Medvedev said Russia would turn off gas supply to Europe if Brussels pushes ahead with a price cap on Russian gas.\n\nResponding to comments by European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen about putting a ceiling on the price Europe pays for Russian gas, Medvedev wrote on the Telegram messaging app: \"There will simply be no Russian gas in Europe.\"\n\n7:10 p.m.: Swedish home appliance giant Electrolux and French industrial gas company Air Liquide both announced plans to withdraw from Russia on Friday, the latest foreign firms to leave since Moscow invaded Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nElectrolux suspended its operations in Russia after the invasion. The Swedish group does not have a production site in Russia, but before the war the country accounted for 1.6% of its global turnover.\n\nMeanwhile Air Liquide, which employs nearly 720 people in Russia, said it plans to withdraw from Russia by handing over its activities in the country to local managers.\n\nIt said its turnover in Russia represents less than 1% percent of the group's total, which exceeded $23 billion in 2021.\n\n6:05 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden will request $11.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress to provide lethal aid and budget support to Ukraine, and $22.4 billion for COVID-19 relief ahead of a potential fall case surge, the White House said on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe emergency funding request will also include $2 billion to address the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine on U.S. energy supplies, Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), wrote in blog post.\n\nThe $47.1 billion request comes ahead of the conclusion of the 2022 fiscal year on Sept 30. Congress has not yet passed a 2023 funding bill, and Young said lawmakers would likely need to pass a stopgap funding measure allowing them more time to negotiate a more comprehensive fiscal package.\n\nThe White House's requests for the stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution (CR), will also include $3.9 billion in funding to fight against an outbreak of the monkeypox virus and $6.5 billion for natural disaster relief, Young wrote.\n\n5:12 p.m.: Europes energy crisis loomed larger Friday after Russian energy giant Gazprom said it couldnt resume the supply of natural gas through a key pipeline to Germany for now, citing what it said was a need for urgent maintenance work to repair key components, just hours before it was due to restart deliveries, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Russian state-run energy company had shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Wednesday for what it said would be three days of maintenance.\n\nIt said in a social media post Friday evening that it had identified \"malfunctions\" of a turbine and added that the pipeline would not work unless those were eliminated.\n\nIt was the latest development in a saga in which Gazprom has advanced technical problems as the reason for reducing gas flows through Nord Stream 1 explanations that German officials have rejected as a cover for a political power play following Russias invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEuropean utilities have scrambled to find additional supply during the summer months to get ready for the winters heating demands, buying expensive liquefied gas that comes by ship, while additional supplies have come by pipeline from Norway and Azerbaijan.\n\nFears of a winter shortage have eased somewhat as storage has progressed, but a complete cutoff could present Europe with serious difficulties, analysts say. The European Union needs to step up efforts to reduce gas consumption, said energy policy expert Simone Tagliapietra at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels.\n\n4:18 p.m.: The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday that he and his team saw everything they asked to see at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, were not surprised by anything, and he will issue a report early next week on his findings, VOAs United Nations correspondent Margaret Besheer reported.\n\n\"My concern would be the physical integrity would be the power supply and of course the staff,\" Rafael Mariano Grossi told reporters at the airport in Vienna moments after landing.\n\nHe said it is very important for the IAEA to have a physical presence at the facility.\n\n\"What we are doing there is stabilizing, looking at safety, the security, at the safeguard aspects of the plant, in the conviction that if we get this right, this will have some bearing, [some] influence in what happens overall,\" he said.\n\nA team of 13 experts accompanied Grossi, and he said six have remained at Zaporizhzhia. Of those six, two will remain until hostilities cease, which he said will make a huge difference.\n\n2:45 p.m.: Ukraine's military said it had carried out strikes against Russian positions in the region around the southern town of Enerhodar on Friday, near a nuclear power plant where U.N. experts are working, Reuters reported.\n\nThe revelation by the armed forces' general staff was unusual, since the military rarely gives details of specific targets. A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency is gathering data at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, on the edge of Russian-occupied Enerhodar.\n\n\"It has been confirmed that in the region around the towns of Kherson and Enerhodar, precise strikes by our armed forces destroyed three enemy artillery systems as well as a warehouse with ammunition and up to a company of soldiers,\" the general staff said in a Facebook post.\n\nIt did not give more details about the strikes. Kherson is about 300 km (185 miles) south-west of Enerhodar.\n\nRussia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shelling the nuclear power plant. Kyiv rejects the charge, saying pro-Moscow forces are responsible for attacking the facility.\n\n2 p.m.: U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi holds a news conference on Friday around 2:00 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) upon his return from Ukraine, where he led a mission to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the watchdog said.\n\nThe news conference is being held at Vienna airport after Grossi landed there, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement.\n\n1:25 p.m.: The International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant could still be important despite the difficulties met due to Russian presence at the site, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\n\"We did everything to ensure that (the) IAEA would get access to the Zaporizhzhia plant and I believe that this mission may still have a role to play,\" Zelenskyy said in a video streamed at The European House, Ambrosetti Forum meeting in northern Italy.\n\nUkraine's state nuclear company earlier on Friday said that the IAEA mission had not been allowed to enter the plant's crisis center, where Ukraine says Russian troops are stationed, and would struggle to make an impartial assessment of the situation.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we haven't heard the main thing from the IAEA which is the call for Russia to demilitarize the station,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I hope the mission will comply with what we've agreed and that it will serve the interests of the entire international community.\"\n\n12:50 p.m.: After his son, a Russian soldier, was killed in Ukraine, Rinat Sadykov volunteered to join the Russian forces. Back at his home in Siberia, he discusses the loss of his son and his disappointment with the state of the Russian military in eastern Ukraine. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n12:20 p.m.: Fourteen Ukrainian service personnel have been returned to Ukraine in a new prisoner exchange, Ukraine's POW co-ordination center said on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe center did not specify who was released in return.\n\nOne of the released Ukrainian POWs was an officer, and another a medic, the coordination center said.\n\n11:40 a.m.: Finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial powers on Friday pledged to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil in a bid to limit the Kremlins revenues and ability to fund its war in Ukraine, while also curtailing the wars impact on energy prices and inflation, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe ministers said they would impose the cap by barring insurance or shipping companies from helping Russia sell oil at prices above the set limit.\n\nThe decision follows discussions at the groups summit earlier this year and aims at solving one of the vexing problems with sanctions against Russia: Global oil prices have risen on fears of restricted supply, which has only fattened the Kremlins take.\n\nMeanwhile, skyrocketing energy prices have fed inflation that is squeezing consumers in rich and poor countries alike and threatens to push Europe into recession.\n\n11:05 a.m.: A 31-year-old woman from eastern Ukraine has been detained on accusations of sending the locations of her soldier husband's unit and other army assets to Russian military intelligence, Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) said on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe unnamed woman from Dnipropetrovsk region passed on information about the locations of military buildings and equipment along frontline positions in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, the SBU wrote on Telegram.\n\nThe woman would question her husband about the location of his unit and other Ukrainian formations on the frontline, the agency said.\n\n\"She would pass the information she received through messenger applications to Russian military intelligence, where it was used for artillery and air strikes,\" its statement said. \"She took this step despite the fact that she is married to a serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and that they have a son together,\" the agency said.\n\n10:25 a.m.:\n\n9:15 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to stay away from the funeral on Saturday of Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, sends a deliberate message that underlines his differing view of the world, one of Russia's most prominent journalists has said, according to Reuters.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Pozner, a veteran journalist who interviewed Gorbachev many times and who knows Russia's political elite well, Putin's decision not to attend the funeral was a calculated one.\n\n\"I think its a kind of a statement,\" Pozner, 88, told Reuters in an interview. \"And I dont think that Mr. Putin is a particular fan of Mr. Gorbachev. Thats his right, he doesnt have to be. I think they saw the world very differently.\"\n\nPutin called the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, over which Gorbachev unwittingly presided, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century which he would reverse if given a chance. Gorbachev was devastated too by the collapse of the USSR which he had hoped to reform and preserve.\n\nPutin's decision to launch what he called \"a special military operation\" in Ukraine appears aimed at reversing, at least in part, the collapse which Gorbachev failed to prevent.\n\n8:30 a.m.: President Joe Biden will meet with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa this month, as the administration looks to draw African nations closer to the U.S. at a time when South Africa and many of its neighbors have staked out neutral ground on Russias invasion of Ukraine, The Associated Press reported Friday.\n\nAnnouncement of the September 16 visit comes on the heels of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkens visit to South Africa last month, in which he said the Biden administration sees Africas 54 nations as \"equal partners\" in tackling global problems.\n\nBut the administration has been disappointed that South Africa and much of the continent have declined to follow the U.S. in condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSouth Africa abstained in a United Nations vote to condemn Russias action, and Ramaphosa has avoided any criticism of Russia and instead has called for a mediated peace.\n\n8:10 a.m.:\n\n7:55 a.m.: The United Nations food agency's world price index fell for a fifth month in a row in August, further from all-time highs hit earlier this year, as a resumption of grain exports from Ukrainian ports contributed to improved supply prospects, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Friday that its price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 138.0 points last month versus a revised 140.7 for July.\n\nThe July figure was previously put at 140.9.\n\nThe index has fallen from a record of 159.7 in March, hit after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The August reading was, however, 7.9% higher than a year earlier.\n\nFAO's cereal price index fell 1.4% month-on-month in August, with the re-opening of Ukrainian Black Sea ports under a diplomatic deal as well as favorable wheat harvest prospects in North America and Russia weighing on prices, the agency said.\n\nIn separate cereal supply and demand estimates, FAO lowered its forecast for global cereal production in 2022 to 2.774 billion metric tons from a previous projection of 2.792 billion in early July.\n\n7:15 a.m.: A cargo ship carrying tons of grain from Ukraine was stranded in Istanbuls Bosporus and had to be rescued early Friday, The Associated Press reported.\n\nTurkeys Directorate General of Coastal Safety tweeted that the 173-meter cargo ship was stuck off the coast of the scenic Bebek neighborhood late Thursday because of a rudder malfunction. The busy strait was closed to traffic for the rescue by coastal safety boats. The Panama-flagged Lady Zehma was towed and the strait re-opened.\n\nThe cargo ship had departed the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk under the deal brokered by the United Nations that allows the safe shipment of Ukrainian grain. Its the first reported incident of malfunction since grain shipments restarted last month.\n\nOn August 29, the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul which monitors the ships under the grain deal and is composed of Turkish, Russian, Ukrainian and U.N. officials authorized the movement of Lady Zehma with 3,000 metric tons of corn to Ravenna, Italy. The ship is currently anchored in the Marmara Sea off the coast of Istanbul.\n\n6:50 a.m.: Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over each others' actions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Friday as a team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog tried to check the safety of the facility and avert a potential disaster, Reuters reported.\n\nUkraine's state nuclear company said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission had not been allowed to enter the plant's crisis center, where Ukraine says Russian troops are stationed, and would struggle to make an impartial assessment. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Ukraine was continuing to shell the plant, raising the risk of a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nThe site, 10 km (6 miles) from Ukrainian positions across the Dnipro river, was captured by Russian forces soon after they invaded Ukraine in late February and has become the focus of concern.\n\nIt has come under repeated shelling over the past month, with Kyiv and Moscow trading blame for the firing. The plant is still run by Ukrainian staff and Russia has rejected calls for it to withdraw its troops.\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Grossi and his team spent several hours at Europe's largest nuclear power plant on Thursday and intended to return on Friday across the frontlines to assess damage. Speaking after the initial visit, Grossi said the physical integrity of the plant had been violated several times and he was worried by the situation there. Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said it would be would be difficult for the IAEA team to make an impartial assessment due to Russian interference.\n\n6:25 a.m.: Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has reportedly recruited almost 1,000 inmates from two penal colonies in the southwestern Rostov region, promising them early release if they fight in Moscow's war against Ukraine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nPrigozhin is a businessman who is believed to be the leader of Russia's Wagner private paramilitary group.\n\nThe Vot Tak online television channel quoted inmates at a penal colony in the city of Bataisk on September 1 as saying that Prigozhin arrived at the penitentiary in recent days by personal helicopter along with his associate Dmitry Utkin. He then met with all of the inmates at the colony's central square.\n\nAccording to the inmates, the administration of the IK-15 penal colony ordered all guards to switch off their personal video cameras while Prigozhin and Utkin talked to the inmates.\n\nThey said Prigozhin promised those who joined Russian armed forces in Ukraine will get early release in six months, adding that during the military operations in Ukraine, the inmates \"can do anything they want with the Ukrainians.\"\n\n5:45 a.m.: Two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will stay at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on a permanent basis, Russia's ambassador to international institutions in Vienna told the RIA Novosti news agency on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nAn IAEA mission is currently at the plant, Europe's largest nuclear facility which has been under the control of Russian forces since March.\n\n5:40 a.m.:\n\n5:34 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said Heavy fighting continues in southern Ukraine, including shelling in Enerhodar district, near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.\n\n4:28 a.m.: The latest Ukraine assessment from the Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said Russian forces conducted ground attacks northwest of Slovyansk, south and northeast of Bakhmut, and northwest and southwest of Donetsk City.\n\nThe Russian 3rd Army Corps is continuing to form for deployment to Donbas, the update said, and Russian milbloggers reiterated claims that Ukrainian forces are fighting along four axes of advance in Western Kherson Oblast.\n\n3:32 a.m.: The Joint Operational Coordination Centre has approved eight vessels carrying a total of 158,075 metric tons of grain and other food products to leave Ukraine on Friday.\n\nThey are: the Nord Virgo, from Yuhzny/Pivdennyi to Huangpu, China, carrying 62,340 metric tons of corn; the Stella GS, from Odesa to Haifa, Israel, carrying 30,300 metric tons of corn; the Katsuyama, from Chornomorsk to Haldia, India, carrying 21,000 metric tons of sunflower oil; the Mavka, from Chornomorsk to Constanta, Romania, carrying 12,500 metric tons of sunflower oil; the Fulmar S, from Yuhzny/Pivdennyi to Varna, Bulgaria, carrying 9,835 metric tons of sunflower meal; the Spring, from Chornomorsk to Iskandarun, Turkey, carrying 8,500 metric tons of wheat; the Canga Star, from Chornomorsk to Brest, France, carrying 7,000 metric tons of rapeseed, and the Mubariz Ibrahimov, from Odesa to Tekirdag, Turkey, carrying 6,600 metric tons of sunflower oil.\n\n2:40 a.m.: Finland on Thursday slashed the number of visas issued to Russian citizens to a tenth of the regular amount in a move seen as a show of solidarity with Ukraine.\n\nFinland, which shares the longest border with Russia of all European Union member countries, announced the decision in August amid growing pressure from politicians and ordinary citizens to restrict the movement of Russian tourists through the Nordic country as Moscow continues its war in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nStarting Thursday, Finland will only permit Russians to apply for tourist visas once a week and in just four Russian cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Murmansk and Petrozavodsk close to the Finnish border.\n\nFinnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he was particularly worried about a kind of Russian \"tourist route\" through Helsinki airport, which has been used by thousands of Russians before Moscows Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine.\n\nOn top of its visa decision, the Finnish Foreign Ministry said the government is currently exploring the possibility of helping Russian human rights defenders, civil society members and journalists critical to the Kremlin by establishing a new kind of humanitarian visa enabling them to access the Nordic country.\n\n1:30 a.m.: U.S. law enforcement agents on Thursday searched New York properties linked to Viktor Vekselberg, a sanctioned billionaire Russian oligarch, NBC New York reported, as Washington seeks to use sanctions and property seizures to pressure Moscow to stop its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA Reuters witness observed FBI and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents haul boxes and safes out of an apartment building on Park Avenue in Manhattan, where NBC said a property linked to Vekselberg was located.\n\nAgents also searched a Vekselberg-linked property in Southampton, New York, NBC said.\n\nVekselberg could not be reached for comment.

The three others were lost earlier during the conflict.\n\nHowever, the IAEA experts now present at Europes largest nuclear power plant located in the middle of a war zone also learnt that the 330/750 kV reserve line linking the facility to a nearby thermal power plant was delivering the electricity the ZNPP generates to the external grid. The same reserve line can also provide back-up power to the ZNPP if needed.\n\nIn addition, plant management informed the IAEA team that one of the ZNPPs two operating units was disconnected in the afternoon today due to grid restrictions. The same unit 5 was disconnected also on 1 September the day of Director General Grossis arrival at the site due to an internal electrical failure but it was reconnected the following day.\n\nOne reactor is still operating and producing electricity both for cooling and other essential safety functions at the site and for households, factories and others through the grid. The ZNPP is held by Russian forces since early March, but its Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate the plant.\n\n\"Our team on the ground received direct, fast and reliable information about the latest significant development affecting the plants external power situation, as well as the operational status of the reactors. We already have a better understanding of the functionality of the reserve power line in connecting the facility to the grid. This is crucial information in assessing the overall situation there,\" Director General Grossi said.\n\n\"The great value of finally having the IAEA permanently present at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant is already abundantly clear. It is a game changer,\" he said, adding that the IAEA remained in close contact with its Ukrainian counterparts and continued to receive valuable updates about the situation from them.\n\nFriday evenings disconnection of the 750 kV power line which happened temporarily also on 25 August followed renewed shelling in the area, Ukraine separately informed the IAEA.\n\nA secure off-site power supply from the grid and back-up power supply systems are essential for ensuring nuclear safety. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict. At a press conference on Friday evening after returning to Vienna, he expressed his concern about the off-site power supply situation at the ZNPP by marking this pillar half red, half yellow in a traffic light-style infographic about the plants safety status.\n\nFurther underlining the fragile nuclear safety and security situation, there had been continued shelling of the site from 29 August up to the day before the Director General and his team arrived at the ZNPP. There was damage to the facilitys solid radioactive waste storage, the ventilation pipe of special building 1, and the ZNPP training building.\n\nAt the ZNPP, the ISAMZ experts will carry out detailed and continuous work to assess the physical damage to the plants facilities, determine the functionality of the main and back-up safety and security systems and evaluate the staffs working conditions, in addition to performing urgent safeguards activities on the site.\n\n\"The difference between having the IAEA at the site and not having us there is like day and night. I remain gravely concerned about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant this hasnt changed but the continued presence of the IAEA will be of paramount importance in helping to stabilise the situation. Im immensely proud of the critically important and courageous work the IAEA team is now able to perform at the ZNPP,\" Director General Grossi said.\n\nThe Director General will early next week issue a report about the safety, security and safeguards situation in Ukraine including the findings from his mission to the ZNPP.",

While he was not yet in the city himself, he said that he was in contact with the police and that emergency services were working to clear it of possible hazards before residents could return.\n\nRussias Ministry of Defense which a day earlier had said that it was moving to reinforce its defensive positions in the region confirmed on Saturday that it had pulled its forces out of Izium, six months after its forces laid siege to and then seized the city. In a statement, it presented the retreat as a preplanned move, intended to strengthen its efforts in the east where its army has been bogged down for weeks.\n\nMaintaining control of towns and cities has at times proven tenuous over the course of the war, and it was not immediately clear how secure Ukraines control over Izium was and what efforts Russia might take to try to win it back.\n\nBut the loss of Izium a strategically important railway hub that Russian forces seized in the spring after a bloody weekslong battle could mark a turning point in the war, dwarfed only by Russias humiliating defeat around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in the spring.\n\nThe first signs that Russian forces would retreat rather than fight emerged late on Friday.\n\n\"Yesterday evening, Russians put a white flag nearby the railway station,\" Yevhen, a Ukrainian officer who participated in the liberation of Izium, said in a telephone interview. \"There was street fighting all over the night.\" He asked to be identified by only his first name out of concerns for his security.\n\nMuch about the Ukrainian offensive in the Kharkiv region, where Izium is, was shrouded in uncertainty amid a lack of official confirmation, and military analysts cautioned that it was a fast-moving situation that could change by the hour.\n\nBut the lightning offensive in the countrys northeast has reshaped what had become a grinding war of attrition. In a matter of days, Russian front lines have buckled, Moscows troops have fled and one village after another has come once more beneath Ukraines yellow and blue banner like the town of Kupiansk just north of Izium, which sits on key supply routes to the eastern front line.\n\nUkraines Security Service posted a photo on Telegram showing members of the special forces in Kupiansk.\n\n\"We move further!\" the post read, according to the Ukrinform news agency.\n\nAs Ukrainian officials celebrated the turn of events, however cautiously, some prominent pro-Kremlin military bloggers expressed anger and frustration at the rapid developments.\n\nA Russian military blogger, who goes by the name Rusich, has 278,000 followers on Telegram and claimed to be in the city on Friday, wrote that the surrender of Izium was a \"small setback\" and urged his followers not to \"despair.\"\n\nWith the Russians out of towns and cities they had battered in order to seize, the cost of their monthslong occupation was just starting to come into focus. Ukrainian officials said they had dispatched investigators to newly liberated towns to begin compiling evidence of Russian war crimes.\n\nIn his overnight address, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said the military had recaptured more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"Actions to check and secure the territory continue,\" he said. \"We are gradually taking control of new settlements.\"\n\nThe eastern offensive, which began earlier this week, has cleared Russian forces from more than 2,500 square kilometers of land in the Kharkiv region as of Friday, according to an estimate by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank.\n\n\"There is still a lot that we dont know about the offensive, but it is clear this was well planned and executed by Ukrainian forces,\" said Rob Lee, a military analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \"It looks like a very effective combined arms operation with tanks, mechanized infantry, Special Operations forces, air defenses, artillery and other systems.\"\n\nUkrainian and Western officials cautioned that the offensive operations were in their early days, that the situation was fluid and that any gains were far from secure. Some military analysts warned that the Ukrainians rapid advance could leave them stretched thin and vulnerable to counterattack.\n\nIn addition to the counteroffensive in the northeast, Ukraine has been making a push in the south to recapture territory in the Kherson region.\n\nMr. Marchenko, the mayor of Izium, said that about 12,000 residents had remained in the city and desperately needed humanitarian supplies.\n\nHe said he hoped that residents who had fled could start returning in three or four days but that devastation awaited them.\n\n\"Theres no single residential building that wasnt damaged,\" the mayor said.\n\n\"Heating is the biggest problem,\" he added. \"I doubt whether we would be able to restore the heating system before winter.\"\n\nOleksii Reznikoff, Ukraines defense minister, did not comment on specific gains but at a conference in Kyiv on Saturday he said the Russian troops were on the run.\n\n\"Russian troops will run, and they will, believe me, because today we are destroying their logistics chains, warehouses, and so on,\" he said. \"And the question will arise: And where should they go? It will be like an avalanche.\"\n\nOne line of defense will shake and it will fall, he said, and then another and another.\n\nIvan Nechepurenko and Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting.",

That would set into motion a chain of events that could intensify the current nuclear crisis. Here's how.\n\nNuclear plants need electricity\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is the largest in Europe, capable of producing thousands of megawatts of electricity. But the plant also needs power from the same electricity grid it feeds.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe power is used to run the various parts of the plant, including its safety and cooling systems. Specifically, nuclear power plants require water to be pumped constantly through their cores in order to function safely, and the pumps need electricity.\n\nAt Zaporizhzhia, the power is normally supplied by four high-voltage lines, which connect the nuclear complex to Ukraine's electricity grid, but the conflict has seen those lines systematically cut. The last 750kV line was severed on September 3, according to the IAEA.\n\nA backup line was disconnected two days later due to a fire on the site. In a press conference shortly after returning from Zaporizhzhia, Grossi told reporters that he believed the power lines were being deliberately targeted:\n\n\"It is clear that those who have these military aims know very well... to hit where it hurts so that the plant becomes very, very problematic,\" he said.\n\nZaporizhzhia has been making its own power, but that's a limited solution\n\nSince losing its last connection to the grid on Sept. 5, the nuclear plant has been powering itself in so-called \"islanding operation mode.\" Under this setup, the Unit 6 reactor has been producing low levels of electricity that are running the rest of the facility.\n\nThe reactors at Zaporizhzhia are designed to operate in this mode during startup, according to a nuclear engineer who worked directly with the reactors when the plant began operations in the 1980s, but who was not authorized to speak publicly by his current employer.\n\n\"It's not good, it cannot be done for a long time,\" he says. The problem is less to do with the reactor itself than the turbine, generators and other systemsall of which are designed to run at significantly higher power levels than islanding operation mode provides.\n\nAdding to the problem, Grossi said in his statement, is the increasing strain on the plant's Ukrainian operators. Many of the plant's current staff of just under 1,000 live in the nearby town of Enerhodar. Its water, sewage and electrical supplies have all been disrupted in recent days by the same fighting that's damaged the lines around the plant.\n\n\"The shelling is putting in danger operators and their families, making it difficult to adequately staff the plant,\" Grossi says.\n\nShutting down the last reactor will trigger emergency generators\n\nWith conditions deteriorating, it seems more likely that Ukrainian authorities will decide to power down the last reactor. But in the short term, that could exacerbate the crisis.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nThat's because nuclear reactors are more like charcoal grills than gas stoves. Even after they're shut off, they remain hot for a long period of time. Water must still circulate in the cores to prevent a meltdown.\n\nWith its reactors shut down, Zaporizhzhia will switch to backup emergency diesel generators to keep the reactors cool. The emergency generators themselves are a tried-and-true method for cooling a nuclear reactor. In fact, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires U.S. plants to switch to emergency diesel generators immediately, bypassing the \"islanding operation mode\" used in Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"We don't want to go on the diesel generators, but it's a situation you can abide by for awhile,\" says Steven Nesbit, a nuclear engineer and member of the American Nuclear Society's rapid response taskforce, which is tracking the current crisis. For example, after losing power during Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant in Florida operated for days on emergency diesel power.\n\nIf the generators run out of fuel, a meltdown could occur\n\nAccording to the IAEA, the Zaporizhzhia plant has more than a dozen emergency generators standing by. Normally, the plant holds a 10-day reserve of diesel fuel, the agency says, and currently has approximately 2,250 tonnes of fuel available.\n\nIf that fuel is depleted, or the generators are damaged in further fighting, it could trigger a meltdown.\n\nBut Nesbit says that doesn't necessarily mean there would be a Chernobyl-like catastrophe. The meltdown at Chernobyl was due to a unique mix of design flaws and operator error that would be essentially impossible to replicate at Zaporizhzhia.\n\nAnd unlike the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, some of the reactors at Zaporizhzhia have already been shut down for a while, allowing the nuclear fuel to cool somewhat, Nesbit says.\n\nEven in the worst case scenario, the reactors at Zaporizhzhia are a modern design surrounded by a heavy \"containment\" building, Nesbit says. \"It's reinforced concrete, typically about three to four feet of that; it's designed to withstand very high internal pressures.\"\n\nThat could allow it to hold in any radioactive material.\n\nBut the world's nuclear agency doesn't want to test any of this. And for that reason, Grossi is calling on all sides to implement a safety zone immediately.\n\n\"There is no time to waste,\" he says.",

                "cc_text": "The long-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive near Kharkiv may be underway.\n\nRussian Telegram channels are lighting up with reports of Ukrainian attacks near the city of Balakliia in Kharkiv Oblast.\n\nSerhiy Leshchenko, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff, said he expected Kyiv to announce \"great news\" about its counter-offensive in the eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday evening, Reuters reported. He did not give further details.\n\nThe Kharkiv Oblast, in northeast Ukraine, \"is on the far end of the front line from the southern Kherson region, which Ukraine last week announced as the focus of a push to retake territory.\"\n\n\"Tonight there is going to be great news from President Zelenskiy on (the) counteroffensive operation in Kharkiv region,\" Leshchenko said on Twitter.\n\nControl of Balakliia could facilitate a Ukrainian attempt to encircle or partially encircle the Russian-held city of Izyum, said Kyiv-based military analyst Oleh Zhdanov, according to Reuters.\n\nZelensky advisor Mykhailo Podolyak hinted of things to come.\n\nIn a Tweet Monday, Sam Ramani noted that Zelensky reported that Ukraine took out a Russian warehouse containing S-300 missiles used to strike Kharkiv.\n\n\"Zelensky says that Ukraine destroyed a warehouse where Russia kept S-300 missiles to strike Kharkiv. Another win for Ukraine's MLRS systems.\"\n\nTaras Berezovets, who claims to be a Ukrainian special forces soldier, posted a hopeful Tweet Tuesday about a Ukrainian counteroffensive near Kharkiv.\n\n\"So, Ukrainian counteroffensive near Kharkiv has begun. Keep our fingers crossed.\"\n\nWhen asked Tuesday about Ukraines attacks in the Kharkiv region, Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagons top spokesman, said he didn't have any updates to provide. But he told reporters that Ukrainian forces in the Kherson region have \"continued to make some forward movement\" and that \"we are aware that they have retaken some villages.\"\n\nHe declined to offer further details at his briefing, deferring questions to Ukraines military.\n\nAnd when asked why the Pentagon has been reluctant to call recent Ukrainian attacks a counter-offensive, Ryder said that too was up to the Ukrainians.\n\n\"This is a Ukrainian military operation,\" he said. \"We'll leave it to the Ukrainians to characterize or define their operations in terms of where they are in their campaign. And so again, it's not appropriate for me, as a Department of Defense spokesperson, to characterize it for them.\"\n\nBut at least one outside observer was less shy about describing the attacks.\n\n\"Estonia's cyber-command chief Kaupo Rosin predicts that Ukraine can expel Russia out of the Dnipro River right bank in 2 months,\" Sam Ramani said in a tweet. \"Rosin predicts the liberation of Donbas and Crimea could take months or years.\"\n\nIf this offensive turns out to be as it seems, it would mean Ukraine has opened up two major offensives, one in the northeast and one in the south, aimed at unseating Russian gains.\n\nBefore heading into more of the latest news and updates from Ukraine, The War Zone readers can get caught up with our previous rolling coverage here.\n\nThe Latest\n\nUkraine also appears to have made progress on its southern offensive.\n\nIn its latest assessment, the U.K. Defense Ministry map does not address a specific counter-offensive near Kharkiv, but it shows Ukrainian attacks on the Russian-held Kherson Oblast and continued fighting near Kharkiv.\n\nThe latest U.K. Defense Ministry map shows Ukrainian attacks near Kherson as well as north of Kharkiv. (U.K. Defense Ministry map).\n\nIn addition, the latest information provided by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and AEI's Critical Threats Project shows Ukraine claimed counter-offensives near Kherson as well as near Kharkiv in the east.\n\nThe Ukrainian counter-offensive \"is tangibly degrading Russian logistics and administrative capabilities in occupied southern Ukraine,\" according to the latest ISW assessment. \"As ISW has previously reported, Ukrainian officials explicitly confirmed that Ukrainian troops seek to attrit Russian logistical capabilities in the south through precision strikes on manpower and equipment concentrations, command centers, and logistics nodes.\"\n\nInstitute for the Study of War and AEI's Critical Threats Project\n\nFor instance, Kirill Stremousov, head of the Kherson Oblast occupation regime, told Russian media outlet TASS that his administration has paused annexation referendum plans in Kherson Oblast due to \"security\" concerns, according to ISW.\n\n\"The Ukrainian Resistance Center similarly reported that Russian occupation authorities are abandoning plans for referenda due to the ongoing counter-offensive,\" the ISW report says. \"Shortly after TASS published his comment, Stremousov posted on Telegram denying he called for a pause because his administration had never set an official date for the referendum. Both of Stremousovs statements indicate a high level of disorganization within occupation regimes that is likely being exacerbated by the effects of the counter-offensive. Ukrainian forces intend to slowly chip away at both Russian tactical and operational level capabilities in Kherson Oblast, and in doing so will likely have significant impacts on the administrative and bureaucratic capabilities of occupation officials.\"\n\nA Russian airbase at the Kherson International Airport also apparently came under Ukrainian attack.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has also struck Russian pontoon bridges in Kherson Oblast.\n\n\"According to the Southern Operational Command, Ukrainian forces attack two floating bridges near Darivka and Hola Prystan,\" according to a tweet from the Kyiv Independent news organization. \"All Russian pontoon bridges in the region are in firing range, the military says.\"\n\nThe @NLWartracker Twitter handle goes a step further, saying the pontoon bridge attacks, as well as those on a nearby Russian warehouse, were carried out by the Ukrainian Air Force.\n\n\"Dar'iivka, #Kherson pontoon bridge GO BOOM. After attack reportedly by fighter aircraft, The pontoon bridge is no more as can be seen on these recent sat. images, also a warehouse area on the S side has been hit and can be seen burning.\"\n\nThere is no proof that we know of at this time that these targets were hit by aircraft. In the recent past, HIMARS has been used to hit similar sites. Although, with the help of U.S.-supplied anti-radiation missiles, this could be changing, with the Ukrainian Air Force taking on a more significant role on and beyond the front lines.\n\nThese reported Ukrainian attacks come as more evidence is surfacing of Russias inability to sustain the full-scale invasion it launched Feb. 24.\n\nOn Monday, The New York Times reported that Russia is buying millions of artillery shells and rockets from North Korea.\n\nThe purchases are \"a sign that global sanctions have severely restricted its supply chains and forced Moscow to turn to pariah states for military supplies.\"\n\nThe disclosure \"comes days after Russia received initial shipments of Iranian-made drones, some of which American officials said Russia had issues operating. U.S. government officials said Russias decision to turn to Iran, and now North Korea, was a sign that sanctions and export controls imposed by the United States and Europe were hurting Moscows ability to obtain supplies for its army.\"\n\nThe report prompted Jack Watling of @Rusi.org to rethink his previous position on the state of Russian artillery shell supplies.\n\nWhen asked about Russia turning to North Korea, Ryder said its another sign that Russia is having logistical problems.\n\n\"We do have indications that Russia has approached North Korea to request ammunition,\" he told reporters Tuesday. \"I'm not able to provide any more detail than that at this point in time. But it is indicative of the situation that Russia finds itself in, in terms of its logistics and sustainment capabilities as it relates to Ukraine. We assess that things are not going well on that front for Russia. So the fact that they're reaching out to North Korea is a sign that they're having some challenges on the sustainment front.\"\n\nThe Conflict Arms Research (CAR) watchdog group recently released a report of its latest assessment of how Russia is using foreign components in its weapons systems.\n\n\"A CAR field investigation team returned to Ukraine from 12 to 16 July 2022 to document additional items and systems that Ukrainian authorities recovered from Russian forces starting in February 2022.\"\n\nThese included the components of a Ka-52 helicopter, multiple cruise missiles, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and communications and navigation equipment, all of which were manufactured in Russia.\n\n\"To date, CAR has identified a total of 144 non-Russian manufacturers of more than 650 unique component models in Russian materiel used in the war on Ukraine. Many of these items were manufactured after 2014, when the war in eastern Ukraine first began and the European Union and United States imposed an initial set of sanctions on the Russian Federation. Some items were produced as recently as 2021.\"\n\nThus, the Russian Federations \"ability to develop advanced weapon systems such as cruise missiles is thus highly reliant on very specific non-Russian technology.\"\n\nWe covered the issue of foreign components in Russian weapons systems back in May.\n\nAnd, thanks to a shortage of bearings, Russia is having trouble shipping supplies by rail, noted former Swedish Army officer Anders Tengstrm.\n\n\"Russian railways are grinding to a halt - why? Because they can't replace worn out bearings on their train carriers. Why can't they do that? Because Swedish SKF closed their factory in Tver (RU) and the output produced was for the RU railways.\"\n\nThe supply issue is so critical that Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin \"signed a decree on the creation in the Russian Federation of two armored repair plants of the Ministry of Defense,\" the pro-Ukrainian Ukraine Now Telegram reported Tuesday. \"The deadline for putting the facilities into operation is emergency, just four months.\"\n\nAnd if a lack of supplies werent bad enough, Russian soldiers are being targeted over a lack ofaffection, according to Anton Barbashin, the editorial director of Riddle Russia, an online journal of Russian affairs.\n\nUkrainian hackers, using \"fake accounts of attractive women,\" asked Russian soldiers to send their pictures. Ukrainian troops then used those pictures to geolocate the Russian troop locations and strike them with artillery fire, Barbashin noted.\n\nWhile Russia is experiencing supply issues, so too is Ukraine, at least from its erstwhile German allies.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has blocked the sale of German weapons to Ukraine, according to the Kyiv Independent, citing the German newspaper Die Welt.\n\n\"Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) is ready to supply Ukraine with 100 Leopard 2A7 tanks and provide training sessions for soldiers worth 1.55 billion euros. Yet, according to Die Welt, Chancellor Scholz did not react to the offer.\"\n\nBut other nations are less reticent about providing Ukraine with arms.\n\n\"According to VK Russian social network, Ukrainian sources report that the 26th Artillery Brigade and the 120th Reconnaissance Battalion of the Ukrainian army took delivery of Poseidon H10 and larger Poseidon H6 UAVs, the ArmyRecognition.com website reported.\n\nThe drones, manufactured by the Cypriot company Swarmly Ltd., were purchased by the charitable foundation of Serhiy Prytula\" for 700,000 Euros.\n\nThe Poseidon H10 drone made by Swarmly Ltd. (Swarmly Ltd. photo)\n\nThe Poseidon H6 drone, made by Swarmly Ltd. (Swarmly Ltd. photo)\n\nMeanwhile, crowdfunding efforts are underway for Turkish drones and a Czech T-72 main battle tank.\n\nThanks to one crowdfunding effort, three Bayraktar TB2 drones arrived in Ukraine, according to the Ukraine Now Telegram channel. The money was collected as part of the People's Bayraktar project, however, the manufacturer decided to transfer the drones to Ukraine for free.\n\nSo instead, the money was used to purchase a year's access to the database of satellite images of the ICEYA constellation.\n\nAnd according to the Oryx weapons tracking site, the Embassy of Ukraine in the Czech Republic \"has launched a crowdfunding campaign for a T-72 Scarab\" main battle tank. \"The Czech MoD has guaranteed its delivery to Ukraine if enough funds are collected.\"\n\nMore proof has been proffered that Ukraine is using munitions from an unlikely source - Iran.\n\nIn a Twitter thread posted Tuesday, the Ukraine Weapons Tracker handle offers more details on what it says is the use by Ukrainian artillery troops of Iranian OF-462 122mm projectiles.\n\nThroughout the war, both sides have been innovative in turning civilian vehicles into weapons of war.\n\nThe latest example is the humble Lada Niva.\n\nAnd Rob Lee posted a video \"showing a Ukrainian 9A310M1 TELAR (part of the Buk-M1 system) launching a 9M38M1 SAM.\"\n\nThe undated video apparently shows one of the system's four anti-aircraft missiles being launched at a target.\n\nThe Ukrainian News 24 Twitter handle posted a video of what it claims is the destruction \"of a Russian infantry fighting vehicle by Ukrainian tank at close range.\"\n\nMaking matters worse for Russian troops is a lack of pay.\n\nThe Kyiv Independent, citing the U.K. Defense Ministry, noted that Russian soldiers face morale and discipline issues and often go unpaid.\n\n\"The U.K. Defense Ministry reported, in addition to combat fatigue and high casualties, Russian troops are likely experiencing \"significant problems with sizable combat bonuses not being paid.\"\n\nBut at least the White House is not designating Russia as a terrorist state.\n\n\"The White House confirms that Joe Biden has made a final decision to not designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism,\" Sam Ramani tweeted. \"The main reason for Biden's decision is the risk of terrorism sanctions impeding food exports and Black Sea grain export deal. Given Russia's rhetoric about sanctions impeding grain and fertilizer shipments, a terrorism designation could give Moscow a pretext to scrap the deal.\"\n\nDuring its long-awaited visit to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found damage from attacks and that Russian military vehicles and equipment were being stored there.\n\n\"While past events had not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, they represented a constant threat to nuclear safety and security because critical safety functions (containment of the radioactivity and cooling in particular) could be impacted,\" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi noted in the organizations latest report on nuclear reactors in the warzone, released Tuesday.\n\nDuring the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ), \"the team closely witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the ZNPP, in particular on 3 September when the team was instructed to evacuate to the ground level of the Administrative Building,\" according to the report, which does not specify who launched the attacks, which each side claimed the other did.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., later reiterated her position that Russia is solely to blame for any damage to the plant.\n\nThe ISAMZ team observed damage at different locations \"caused by reported events\" with some of the damage being close to the reactor buildings.\n\nThe IAEA team observes the damage caused by shelling on the roof of the special building at the ZNPP that houses, among other items, the fresh nuclear fuel and the solid radioactive waste storage facility. (Photo: IAEA)\n\nThe team found damage to a turbine lubrication oil tank; the roofs of various buildings such as the building for the spent fuel transporter vehicle; the special building that houses, among other items, the fresh nuclear fuel, and the solid radioactive waste storage facility; the new training building; the building where the Central Alarm Station of the physical protection system is located; and the container where the radiation monitoring system is located, in the vicinity of the dry spent fuel storage facility.\n\nThe ISAMZ team also reported first-hand observations of damage to the road surface, walls, and windows of various buildings, as well as at the overpass connecting the reactor units at the ZNPP.\n\n\"The ISAMZ noted with concern that the shelling could have impacted safety related structures, systems and components, and could have caused safety significant impacts, loss of lives and personnel injuries.\"\n\nDamage caused by shelling to the elevated passage of Unit 6. (Photo: IAEA)\n\n\"While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance.\"\n\nIn the wake of the visit, the IAEA recommended, among other things, that \"shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities, for the safety of the operating staff and to maintain the physical integrity to support safe and secure operation. This requires agreement by all relevant parties to the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP.\"\n\nThe IAEA was also informed that \"recent shelling had led to safety consequences and damage to plant systems and equipment, such that emergency protection was activated at one of the units, diesel generators were set in operation, and the nitrogen-oxygen station and an auxiliary building were damaged. The ongoing shelling could damage other critical plant systems and equipment, and lead to more severe consequences, including unlimited release of radioactive materials to the environment. Therefore, any shelling endangering the safety and security of the ZNPP needs to be avoided.\"\n\nThe team found that there were \"Russian military personnel, vehicles and equipment at various places at the ZNPP, including several military trucks on the ground floor of the Unit 1 and Unit 2 turbine halls.\"\n\nAs grim as the situation is, the IAEA sees a glimmer of hope.\n\n\"Now, vitally, through the ISAMZ the IAEA has established a presence at the ZNPP which will be of paramount importance in helping to stabilize the situation. This should also enable the IAEA to monitor closely the situation at the site, and to receive direct, fast and reliable information.\"\n\nThe ISAMZ experts \"will carry out detailed and continuous work to assess the physical damage to the plants facilities, determine the functionality of the main and back-up safety and security systems, and evaluate the staffs working conditions, in addition to performing safeguards activities on the site.\"\n\nDespite the presence of the ISAMZ team, problems apparently continue.\n\n\"BREAKING: The Ukrainian utility Energoatom reports that the final electrical line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been cut,\" NPR editor/correspondent Geoff Brumfiel tweeted Monday.\n\n\"The last operating reactor at the site is now shut down. This is potentially the most serious situation at the plant so far.\"\n\nConcerns about the devastation that could occur at ZNPP have existed throughout this war, as we noted back in April.\n\nWe will continue to update this story until we state otherwise.",

(Photo Konstantin Mihalchevskiy / Sputnik via AP)\n\nIn a recent Bulletin piece, nuclear power experts assessed that a loss of power supply, a human error, or a military mistake could lead to a disaster at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Whereas much has been said about the plants repeatedly disconnected from the power grid and the daunting working conditions of the staff still at the plant, little is known about Russias military capability in and around the plant and their implications.\n\nAs the IAEA conducts its risky mission at the embattled nuclear plant this week, the Bulletin talked with Valeriia Hesse, a Ukrainian non-proliferation and international security expert based in Vienna, Austria. We discussed the possible impact on the Zaporizhzhia plant of a deliberate or accidental heavy artillery shelling or missile strike.\n\nFranois Diaz-Maurin: Do we know the type of weapons Russia is using in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant? And do we know where they are hidden on the plants premises?\n\nValeriia Hesse: According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Russian troops have used barrel and jet artillery in the Zaporizhzhia region. An engineer at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant [ZNPP] commented that Russian forces placed artillery and missile launchers in and around the plant near the Kakhov reservoir. In this case, not only the types of weapons deployed at ZNPP matter, but more so the types of weapons deployed around that could reach the plants premises.\n\nThe defense intelligence of the Ministry of Defense reported that the Russian military has brought 2C7 \"Pion\" artillery units to the Energodar region [the city where the ZNPP is located] and is shelling the plant from the village of Vodyane [located 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) south of the plant]. Batteries of reactive artillery (BM-21 \"Grad\") are also located there and have a reaching capacity of up to 20 kilometers (12 miles). British intelligence has shown that Russia maintains an increased military presence at the nuclear power plant with armored personnel carriers deployed only some 60 meters from reactor number 5. [Editors note: Since Russia seized the plant in March, only two of the six reactors (units no. 5 and 6) have been operating at the ZNPP. On August 25, Ukraines nuclear power company Energoatom reported both units were temporarily disconnected from the external power line which led to the subsequent tripping of the emergency protection. On September 1, because of a mortar shelling, emergency protection triggered again the shutdown of unit 5, and a backup power line was damaged.] Plant employees, on the condition of anonymity, have reported that there are four armored personnel carriers and five to six transportation vehicles under overpasses at the plant and some other equipment in the turbine compartments of power units no. 1 and 2. On top of that, the workers confirmed that Russia shot from the plants site at Ukrainian drones and at the industrial site and the city of Energodar, all the while accusing Ukraines Armed Forces of conducting these attacks.\n\nDiaz-Maurin: What are the exact capabilities of these weapons? For instance, do they have the capacity to penetrate the containment structures which are approximately a one-meter-thick reinforced concrete wall, and subsequently cause an exposure of the reactors core?\n\nHesse: \"Grad\" is a Soviet and Russian reactive volley fire system (multiple launch rocket system or MLRS) of 122 millimeter (mm) (9K51) caliber. The most common projectile for \"Grad\" M-21OF (index 9M22U) weighs 66 kilograms (kg) and is equipped with 6.4 kg of explosive in the warhead. The maximum speed of the projectile is 690 meters per second (about twice the speed of sound). The energy of the projectile explosion is approximately 10 kg of TNT equivalent, or 12 kg of TNT equivalent if we consider the increased energy output of modern artillery shells. For its part, the \"Pion,\" which is also deployed in the region, is a Soviet-made self-propelled artillery installation equipped with a 203 mm caliber gun (2A44). The Pions ammunition load includes OF-43 high-explosive fragmentation shells and an active-rocket projectile. OF-43 shells weigh 110 kg and contain 17.8 kg of explosives and travel at a velocity of 960 meters per second. The explosive energy for this projectile is about 30 kg of TNT equivalent, or 35 kg of TNT equivalent for a more modern explosive.\n\nA reactor containment is designed and built in such a way as to withstand enormous internal and external forces. The walls strength also has a safety margin, which means it can withstand greater energy than that of the maximum possible design accident. Typically, a reactor containment is designed to withstand the crash of a commercial airplane of over 300 tons at a velocity of 700 km per hour. This means that the reinforced structure could survive an external force of over 70 x 108 Joules, which is equivalent to almost 1.7 tons of TNT.\n\nAt the ZNPP, the containment is also supposed to survive a shock wave with a compression pressure in the front of 30 kilopascals (about 4.3 pounds per square inch or 0.3 atmosphere). For comparison, the incident pressure of a Grad and Pion projectile blast at 20 centimeters (less than one foot) would be almost 36,000 and 50,000 kilopascals, respectively. The 30-kilopascal pressure threshold would be reached with an M-21OF blast or OF-43 blast happening only 11.5 meters (37 feet) or 16 meters (52 feet) away from the reactor containment building, respectively.\n\nSurface analysis suggests that heavy artillery, like the one deployed in the region, has a possibility of damaging the reactor containment of the nuclear power plant if there is a deliberate effort to pierce it and successive strikes hit the same area. Physicist Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies told me that the exact pressure per unit area will be different depending on the size and shape of the plane and projectiles front surface. \"You can compare it to poking fabric with a finger to doing it with a needle,\" he said. However, if less powerful artillery is used, it is unlikely to cause an exposure of the reactors core in a single hit.\n\nLet me add that the containment building is not designed to withstand a missile hit, like those from a Kalibr or Tochka-U. Would one of those missiles hit even 47 meters (154 feet) away from the reactor, it would create a shock wave pressure above the containment design limit.\n\nThe problem is that many of these weapons, including Grad, Pion, and Tochka-U, are in service in both Russia and Ukraine, making it possible for both sides to accuse each other. But the plants workers and Ukrainian officials have since the beginning denounced Russian forces as being responsible for the shelling at the ZNPP.\n\nDiaz-Maurin: Given the confusion around the plant and in the fog of war, whats the likelihood of a nuclear disaster happening now at the ZNPP? What are, in your view, the most likely scenarios potentially leading to such a disaster? A failed or deliberate launch of a missile, a drone strike, or else?\n\nHesse: Let me say this first. Everyone should remember that Zaporizhzhia is an operating nuclear facility. So any military intervention is already critical. The ZNPP is the largest in Europe, and a radiation accident there would be a global catastrophe.\n\nBased on the analysis above, a deliberate heavy artillery shelling or missile strike has indeed a significant probability of damaging a reactor containment. Now, if we speak about particular systems, attack drone payloads like those deployed by Russia in Ukraine (Kub, Lancet, Orion, and Forpost), which have the same explosive energy as small-caliber artillery, have little chance to penetrate the containment and expose the core.\n\nDespite the risk of a nuclear accident, it is implausible that a thermochemical explosion like that at Chornobyl would happen at ZNPP. Two factors (flaws in reactor design combined with human error) led to the accident at Chornobyl. But the ZNPP has a different type of reactor. However, there is a high risk that an accident like that of the Fukushima disaster in Japan could occur.\n\nAt Chornobyl, a nuclear criticality accident triggered an intensive steam explosion in the core and release of radioactivity directly into the atmosphere. (The RBMK-type reactor did not have a containment structure.) Whereas at Fukushima, a natural disaster led to the shutdown of the reactor cooling system, and there were no in-core explosions. Instead, heating, oxidation, and the meltdown of the cores happened gradually over time, while the radioactive release was partially confined within the containment. (The partial release was necessary to maintain an internal pressure inside the containment below its design limit.)\n\nIn my view, the two most likely scenarios threatening the safety of ZNPP are projectiles hitting a spent fuel storage or the plants cooling systems being damaged. Another scenario is to blow up the machine room at the working power units, which is outside the containment building. However, the plants staff has claimed to be prepared for such a scenario.\n\nOn August 6, the Russian forces hit the plant, with an ordnance landing directly next to the spent nuclear fuel storage area and damaging three radiation monitoring sensors around the site. This already created a threat to the plants safety because it impairs timely detection and response in case of increased radiation levels. If Russian forces eventually succeeded in hitting the storage area directly, the spent fuel itself would not cause an explosion, but the blast would disperse radioactive materials into the atmosphere. The degree of the subsequent radiological contamination in Ukraine and neighboring countries would then depend on the weather conditions.\n\nFor its part, if the reactor cooling systems come out of order, the fuel will overheat, creating the conditions for a Fukushima-type accident. Even when a reactor is not operational, the fuel components keep decaying, emitting excessive amounts of heat for years after being taken out of the reactor core into a spent fuel storage pool which also requires cooling. In case of the absence of cooling, the overheating damages fuel rods and can cause a meltdown and the release of radioactive isotopes, from short-lived to the ones with very long half-lives, causing immediate as well as long-term damage to peoples health and the environment.\n\nDiaz-Maurin: What about Russia reportedly planning to disconnect the plant from the electrical grid? Would that pose an additional risk?\n\nHesse: Energoatoms Petro Kotin warned about Russias desire to cut ZNPP off the Ukrainian power grid to connect it to the occupied Crimea and the Russian energy system. The frequencies of the power grids are different, though. Ukraines grid uses a frequency that is synchronized with the European grid system. Disconnecting the plant from the Ukrainian grid and connecting it to the Russian one would require a completeand well-prepared forshutdown of the plant. It would mean a total cut-off of all power lines connected to the Ukrainian system. Russia has not denied its plan to connect Crimea, and, on August 25, the plants workers said Russian forces deliberately damaged the high-voltage power lines that connect the ZNPP to Ukraines grid network.\n\nHowever, for safe operation, a nuclear power plant must continuously transmit the power it generates to the grid system; otherwise, emergency protection systems are activated that shut the reactors down. A blackout also turns the cooling system off, leaving diesel generators as the only system available to continue operating the pumps. This is precisely what happened at the plant on August 25 when all the power lines were cut off due to the ongoing military activity near the plant and automatic safety systems shut down the two reactors (units 5 and 6) that were still operating. After the loss of power, the diesel generators started, and the cooling system continued working, which prevented a nuclear catastrophe. If the generators had failed, without any power supply and thus cooling, the meltdown would have started after only 90 minutes.\n\nFollowing the incident, Energoatom said both reactors have been reconnected to the Ukrainian grid. However, the generators can run for a limited time in an emergency, and the situation requires restoring the external power supply as soon as possible. The condition of the generators is itself unknown; the IAEA mission will have to check if they are in working condition. There is also a question of how much diesel (fuel) is available on the site.\n\nBut a nuclear power plants safety also depends on humans to oversee that the automatic systems operate as planned. Lets not forget that the human factor played a significant role in the Chornobyl accident. Currently, the ZNPPs staff works under severe Russian pressure on top of almost daily shelling and bombing. Because of this, employees describe the psychological state of the plants workers as being critical. This greatly increases the risk of human error.\n\nThe ZNPP has been occupied since March 4, and shelling has continued since August 5, creating a multitude of risks at the nuclear facility. On that day, in particular, three projectiles landed right near one of the reactors. There were risks of hydrogen leakage and dispersal of radioactive substances, as well as a high fire hazard. The nitrogen-oxygen station and the combined auxiliary building were seriously damaged. The defense intelligence of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense also reported that, on August 13, Russian shelling damaged the first unit of a communication workshop of the pumping station and partially destroyed the fire station responsible for the safety of the ZNPP. On top of that, military trucks block access to the turbine areas on the plant, which would impede firefighting in case of emergency. As one can see, the situation at and around ZNPP is volatile and precarious, which poses significant radiation risks due to the militarization of the facility by the Russian occupying forces.\n\nDiaz-Maurin: What can we expect from a UNs International Atomic Energy Agency mission or a team of outside nuclear experts visit of the ZNPP? To what extent, this could help determine the level of the risksand reduce those risksfor long as Russia occupies the site?\n\nHesse: On August 11, Ukraine demanded a declaration from Russia that it accepts the IAEA mission without any preconditions. According to the demand, Russia had to abide not to obstruct the passage of the mission throughout Ukrainian territory, demine the plant, and withdraw its troops, weapons, and equipment from the plant. It took several weeks for Russia to accept the first demand, which it did on August 27. The IAEA mission is currently on its visit to the plant, which is led by IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi himself.\n\nIn August 23, the UNs Security Council determined that it has the \"logistics and security capacity in Ukraine to support any IAEA mission to the [Zaporizhzhia] plant from Kyiv, provided Ukraine and Russia agree.\"\n\nDiaz-Maurin: What about a call for withdrawing Russian forces from the nuclear power plant or establishing a demilitarized zone around the plant?\n\nHesse: Clearly, the only way to ensure the safety of the plant is to remove Russian forces from its premises and establish a demilitarized zone in the surrounding area. This would enable the IAEA team to travel safely to the facility, conduct an inspection, and assess the nuclear safety, security, and application of safeguards at the ZNPP.\n\nHowever, Russia keeps rejecting such a proposal. It is simply not in their interest because they know that the IAEAs position is that Ukraine has a sovereign right to the station and surrounding territory. First, Russia is concerned that demilitarizing the plant would make it more \"vulnerable,\" for example, enabling the IAEA to get control over the plant, which then could give the control back over to Ukraine. Second, the militarization of the ZNPP gives Russia powerful leverage since Ukrainian troops will have a hard time retaking the Zaporizhzhia region if Russian troops set up a military base that Ukraine forces cannot target.\n\nOn top of that, the leverage is also in creating provocations at the plant and blaming the Ukrainian side for those. There have also been reports of false flag operations, like when Russians brought a Pion with \"Z\" inscriptions under a Ukrainian flag to Energodar. All of this is supposed to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of partners and make them pressure Ukraine to negotiate as quickly as possible. The threat of an uncontrolled transborder radiation release potentially reaching other European countries creates this sense of urgency. Third, the ZNPP would be a crucial energy source for occupied Crimea and southern Ukraine. The plant is beneficial for Russia while it is occupying those territories. Additionally, depriving Ukraine from 20 percent of its domestic electricity production creates extra pressure, especially with the anticipated energy crisis this coming winter.\n\nDiaz-Maurin: Some have qualified Russias actions as \"nuclear terrorism.\" What do they mean by that?\n\nHesse: According to the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (2005), the actor falls under the definition of being a nuclear terrorist if it \"uses in any way radioactive material or a device, or uses or damages a nuclear facility in a manner which releases or risks the release of radioactive material: (i) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or (ii) With the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the environment; or (iii) With the intent to compel a natural or legal person, an international organization or a State to do or refrain from doing an act.\" The text notes that the activities of military forces of states are governed outside of the framework of the Convention. However, it emphasizes that it does not make lawful otherwise unlawful acts or preclude prosecution under other laws.\n\nEarlier, the International Court of Justices Advisory Opinion of July 8, 1996, provided another explanation for considering existing international treaties and instruments. These included Additional Protocol 1 of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, Article 35, paragraph 3, which prohibits the employment of \"methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment;\" Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration of 1972 and Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration of 1992, which charge states with a duty \"to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\" These principles apply at all times, being war or peace.\n\nIf a catastrophe happens at ZNPP, the consequences would be widespread and have transboundary effects. The threat of an accident at Zaporizhzhia arose because of the actions of the Russian Federation which turned the nuclear power plant into a military object. So if an accident happens, according to international law, it would be an act of terrorism carried out by Russia.\n\nSix months into the war, the least we can say is that Russias three-day plan to capture Ukraine did not work out. The losses in equipment and manpower are greater than expected, forcing Russia to move old weapons systems out of retirement and increase the size of its Armed Forces to avoid the so-feared general mobilization. On top of that, sanctions are crippling the Russian economy. Consequently, Russian officials have been using negotiation rhetoric more frequently. For now, Putin wants to settle the status quo now that Ukraines position has been strong and even pushing to regain territory. But any negotiation on the status quo will only be a temporary solution until Russia regains power and decides to proceed further. That is why the world must hold Russia responsible for committing acts of nuclear terrorism, continue pressing Putin to de-militarize the plant, and avoid making any concessions to the aggressor.",

                "cc_text": "Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant Friday to observe damage to the Russian-controlled facility, as fighting continues around the plant. The IAEA intends to keep two experts at the facility on an extended basis, but the agencys power to change the conditions at the plant including reported anxiety and exhaustion on the part of the Ukrainian workers, heavy fighting around the plant, and Russian attempts to connect the plant to its own power grid is limited.\n\nAfter his five-hour visit Friday, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi briefed reporters back in Vienna at the agencys headquarters, saying his greatest concern was damage to the building during heavy shelling in August. Its still unclear whos responsible for that shelling, as Ukraine and Russia have traded accusations back and forth. However, with the independent IAEA inspectors present, \"when there is an allegation that something has happened at the plant, you can turn to us,\" Grossi said.\n\nEfforts to get a monitoring team from the IAEA, a UN agency, have been ongoing but were heaviest in August due to the intensifying fighting around the plant. Ukraine has mounted an offensive in recent weeks to reclaim Russian-held territory in the south and southeast. While much of the push is presently focused on the city of Kherson, the Zaporizhzhia plant is still quite close to the front approximately 60 miles from Kherson itself and on the northern border of Russian-held territory.\n\nGiven the potential for catastrophe and lack of independent insight into the situation at the plant, Grossi addressed the UN Security Council on August 11, calling again for a mission to Zaporizhzhia; the agency has for months been asking to go to the facility to provide oversight and technical assistance. Since Russia and Ukraine, as parties to the conflict, have given the agency inconsistent information about the safety and operation of the plant, Grossi stressed the need for an independent fact-finding mission. \"It is those facts, gathered during a site visit, that are needed for the IAEA to be able to develop and provide an independent risk assessment of the nuclear safety and security risks,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Europes largest, supplying approximately 20 percent of Ukraines electricity before the war and half of its nuclear power, according to the Washington Post. Its still producing energy, including energy for export to Europe one of Ukraines limited methods of producing revenue in wartime, particularly as the conflict is choking the countrys agriculture exports. However, that makes the reactors vulnerable not only to occupation and attack but also to limited supply lines for spare parts and the potential for Russia to divert power from the plant to its own grid a delicate process, which risks cutting off the supply of power to cool the reactors.\n\n\"Nuclear is a fear factor, and its also a power factor,\" Cindy Vestergaard, a senior fellow and director with the nuclear safeguards program at the Henry L. Stimson Center, told Vox on Saturday. \"With Zaporizhzhia, were getting to something Russia holds very dear, and that is its power over energy sources. And so nuclear is at the heart of geopolitics, its at the heart of energy policies, and, of course, for the world to keep the lights on.\"\n\nWhat did it take to get the IAEA team to Zaporizhzhia?\n\nAs of now, few details about the monitoring mission and the negotiations enabling it to go forward are known. The New York Times reported Wednesday that 14 experts left Kyiv to travel to the Zaporizhzhia plant, traveling through military checkpoints and active fighting to reach the facility.\n\n\"This is totally unprecedented weve never had an active conflict in a country which also has such a robust nuclear power program. Its the seventh-largest nuclear power program in the world,\" Vestergaard said. \"The dance, or the navigation that the agency would have to do is, obviously, between Ukraine and Russia,\" she said, and would involve \"a lot of details, even down to commas, about how things would be outlined in order for the agency to go.\"\n\nOne point of negotiations was whether the team would enter and leave the area through Ukrainian- or Russian-held territory. The mission opted to travel to the facility from Kyiv via Ukrainian-held territory, possibly to avoid legitimizing Russias occupation of the Zaporizhzhia plant. But even something as mundane as the route used to get to the area had consequences for their trip. \"[The IAEA mission] will not be provided with a special pass,\" Vladimir Rogov, an official with the Russian occupation forces told the Times. \"They had a chance to come from Russia through the liberated territory safely, quickly and without obstacles.\" Russia has also refused calls to demilitarize the area, putting the plant at continued risk of damage from shelling.\n\nRussia does have a vested interest in allowing the monitoring team to visit, Scott Roecker, vice president of the Nuclear Threat Initiatives nuclear materials security program, told Vox on Saturday. \"I think it was in the Russians interest to have IAEA come there for a couple of reasons,\" he said. \"One, so that it could demonstrate that the reactor was still operating, and the plant was operating. Also, to a certain degree, having an international organization at the site, having inspectors there it legitimizes, to a certain degree, Russias presence there.\"\n\nDespite the logistical challenges of the mission and the restrictions Russian officials imposed, Grossi said in a press conference Friday that he had open access to everything he asked to see a positive introductory step that will hopefully yield critical, independent information about the state of the plant for the agencys report to its board of governors when that body convenes next week. From there, Roecker said, information and recommendations can reach the diplomatic level and provide valuable insight and context for further negotiation. But, as Vestergaard stressed, this mission is just a start.\n\n\"Im hoping that one report will not be enough,\" she said. \"Its going to be a series of on-the-ground, on-site, continuous surveillance and physical presence at the facility going forward.\"\n\nHow much can the inspectors change at the plant?\n\nThe missions mandate is concerned with three elements within the Zaporizhzhia facility: the safety of its operations, the security of the facility overall, and the safeguarding of nuclear material produced there. The mission can collect information about these elements and disseminate it, but \"these are inspectors, they cant decide to start operating the plant in a certain way if they feel like its not being operated in a safe manner,\" Roecker said. \"They really arent going to get between the people who are managing the site from a Russian perspective and the Ukrainian operators.\"\n\nThe agency also has no oversight or negotiating power regarding the military activity surrounding the facility. However, it can and has recommended that the fighting stop immediately.\n\nThough its powerless in a legal and logistical sense, the information that the mission could share is powerful, Roecker said. \"Were getting an unbiased source inside that facility, sharing information, and there will be a lot of pressure [...] to make sure that any concerns that they raise are somehow rectified. Theres nothing that they can do themselves, but the mere fact that theyre there the information that they will provide and the recommendations that they give will get a ton of attention and there will be a lot of pressure to make those changes.\"\n\nAs of Saturday, the concerned parties have agreed to allow two inspectors to remain in the area, though for how long is thus far unclear. \"My biggest flag will be, if they leave, can they ever get back in,\" Vestergaard said.\n\nBut some Ukrainian officials want a stronger response from the agency. \"I hope that the IAEA will ultimately be able to fulfill its functions,\" Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration, told Ukrinform. \"Theres hope that the international organization will draw conclusions, taking into account all the threats, and together we will protect the world from the absolutely real threat posed by Russia. Either we solve the existing issues together or someone else will address them for us.\"\n\nIn the longer term, as more nations consider nuclear power to mitigate climate change, the agency and the world will have to consider how to deal with the possibility that civilian nuclear power plants could be weaponized. This would require better treaties and agreements around nuclear power generally, and civilian facilities specifically as well as diversifying the nuclear supply chain. With many countries depending on Russian fuel, technology, and spent fuel reprocessing to maintain their nuclear energy production, some European stakeholders are presently looking for ways to move away from dependence on Russias nuclear power dominance.\n\nWhat the IAEA does in Zaporizhzhia will have ripple effects in the future, Vestergaard told Vox. \"This is going to set a precedent for how the agency will interact with facilities under its purview in active conflict zones,\" she said. \"Hopefully, we wont be in a situation like this again, but as more states acquire nuclear power for civilian purposes, this is something we have to consider going forward. This is a game changer.\"",

Although most of the team left the plant after two days, it said two of its officials would remain there on a permanent basis.\n\nIn an emergency session of the Security Council, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres set out steps for the creation of a demilitarised zone around the plant.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed calls by the IAEA for a safety protection zone at Zaporizhzhia.\n\nPetro Kotyn, who runs Ukraine's nuclear agency Energoatom, suggested a UN peacekeeping contingent could set up a security zone at Zaporizhzhia and Russian troops withdraw.\n\nIn its report, the nuclear agency highlighted the \"extremely stressful conditions\" facing the 907 Ukrainian staff working there under Russian military control.\n\nHowever, the IAEA was careful not to apportion blame to either side.\n\nThe IAEA's report says that there were Russian military vehicles stationed in two turbine halls and under the overpass connecting the reactor units and includes a photo showing Russian-flagged military trucks with the Z insignia parked inside a large building.\n\nOn Wednesday Mr Putin denied that there was any Russian military equipment on-site at Zaporizhzhia.\n\nSeparately, the head of Ukraine's nuclear security agency told a news conference that the site is currently disconnected from the electricity grid following shelling and that Ukraine was considering shutting it down for safety reasons.\n\nWhile the nuclear plant is currently able to generate the electricity it needs to run its own cooling systems, should that cease to be the case it would be reliant on back-up diesel-powered generators.\n\nThe generators require four tanks of diesel a day, Oleh Korikov said, and it would be very difficult to replenish stocks across the front line.\n\nTuesday's report from the IAEA detailed the damage to the plant and said that while continued shelling had not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it did present a constant threat to safety that \"may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance\".\n\nThere was an urgent need for \"interim measures\" to prevent a nuclear accident caused by military action, it added, saying all relevant parties would have to agree to a \"nuclear safety and security protection zone\" being set up to avoid further damage.\n\nThe plant lies on the southern bank of the River Dnieper, across the water from Ukrainian-held towns and military positions.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK's Ministry of Defence says fighting has continued in Ukraine on three fronts over the past 24 hours: in the east, in Donbas; in the north around Kharkiv, and in the south around Kherson.",

U.N. nuclear agency inspectors are scheduled to brief the Security Council on Tuesday about their inspection and safeguard visit to the Zaporizhzhia power plant. European Union energy ministers were slated to hold an emergency meeting Friday in Brussels to discuss the blocs electricity market, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said \"is no longer operating.\"\n\nStudents and parents in Ukraine are adjusting to the new normal as the new academic year begins. (Source: CNN)\n\nMuch of the Zaporizhzhia region, including the key city of Melitopol, lost power Sunday.\n\nBut electricity was gradually being restored, said Vladimir Rogov, the head of the Russia-installed local administration in Enerhodar, the city where the nuclear power plant is located. To the southwest, power was also out in several parts of the port city of Kherson, according to Russias Tass news agency. Rogov blamed the outages in both locations on damage to high-voltage power lines.\n\nWhile Rogov said no new shelling of the area around the six-reactor Zaporizhzhia plant was reported Sunday, the effects of earlier strikes lingered.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency said Saturday that the plant was disconnected from its last main external power line and one reactor was disconnected because of grid restrictions. Another reactor was still operating and producing electricity for cooling and other essential safety functions at the site, as well as externally for households, factories and others through a reserve power line, the IAEA said.\n\nRussian forces have held the Zaporizhzhia facility, Europes largest nuclear plant, since early March, with its Ukrainian staff continuing to operate it.\n\nIAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said he will brief the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday on a mission he led to the plant last week. The 14-member delegation braved gunfire and artillery blasts to reach the plant last Thursday after months of negotiations to enable passage through the fightings front lines.\n\nWithout blaming either warring side, Grossi said his big concerns are the plants physical integrity, its power supply and the staffs condition.\n\nEuropes energy picture remained clouded by the war in Ukraine.\n\nJust hours before Russian energy company Gazprom was due to resume natural gas deliveries to Germany through a major pipeline after a three-day stoppage, it announced Friday that it couldnt do so until oil leaks in turbines are fixed.\n\nThat is the latest development in a saga in which Gazprom has advanced technical problems as the reason for reducing gas flows through Nord Stream 1 explanations that German officials have rejected as a cover for a political power play. Dismissing Gazproms latest rationale for the shutdown, Germanys Siemens Energy which manufactured turbines the pipeline uses - said turbine leaks can be fixed while gas continues to flow through the pipeline.\n\nVon der Leyen blamed Russian President Vladimir Putins war against Ukraine for Europes energy crisis. Before the EU energy ministers meeting this coming Friday, she said electricity and natural gas prices should be decoupled and that she supports a price cap on Russian pipeline gas exported to Europe.\n\nNatural gas is one of the main fuels used in electricity generation, and is a major source of Russias income, along with oil exports.\n\nOn Ukraines battlefield, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address Sunday, without providing specifics, that his countrys forces had retaken control of two settlements in Ukraines south and one in the separatist eastern Donetsk region.\n\nRussian shelling hit the southern Ukraine port city of Mykolaiv during the night, damaging a medical treatment facility, the citys mayor said Sunday.\n\nMykolaiv and its surrounding region have been hit daily for weeks. On Saturday, a child was killed and five people were wounded in rocket attacks in the region, Gov. Vitaliy Kim said.\n\nMykolaiv Mayor Oleksandr Senkevych didnt report injuries in the overnight attack, which he said also damaged residences. Mykolaiv, which is 30 kilometers (20 miles) upstream from the Black Sea on the Southern Bug River, is a significant port and shipbuilding center.\n\nIn Kharkiv, Ukraines second-largest city, Russian shelling late Saturday set a large wooden restaurant complex on fire, according to the regions emergency service. One person was killed and two others were wounded in shelling in the region, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said.\n\nPavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the eastern Donetsk region where Russian forces have been trying to take full control, said four people were killed in shelling on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nAndrew Katell contributed to this story from New York.\n\n___\n\nFollow the APs coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

There were moments where fire was obvious,\" he told reporters after the visit.\n\n\"Heavy machine gun artillery, mortars two or three times were really pretty concerning, I would say, for all of us. We had splendid support from the United Nations Security team that is here with me as well. So I think we showed that the international community is there, could be there and we are continuing this,\" he added.\n\nThe aim of the mission was to assess the \"security and the safety situation\" and to establish a permanent presence at the plant, which \"we believe is indispensable to stabilize the situation, and to get regular, reliable, impartial, neutral updates of what the situation is there,\" Grossi said earlier on Thursday.\n\nWhile at the plant, the team was able to gather \"a lot\" of information in a few hours and see the \"key things,\" Grossi said, according to a video released by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe IAEA chief has now left the plant, however Grossi said the UN nuclear watchdog is \"not going anywhere\" and will have a \"continued presence\" there.\n\n\"We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there at the plant and its not moving. Its going to stay there. Were going to have a continued presence there at the plant,\" he said, speaking to reporters following the visit.\n\nGrossi added that he would continue to worry until the situation at the plant had stabilized.\n\n\"I worry, and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable. It is obvious that the plant and the physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times by chance [and] by deliberation,\" he said.\n\n\"Wherever you stand, whatever you think about this war. This is something that cannot happen and this is why we are trying to put in place certain mechanisms and the presence,\" he said.\n\nSo far, five IAEA inspection team remain at the plant after Grossis departure, Ukraines nuclear operator Energoatom said in a statement.\n\nIt is expected that the remaining inspectors would stay at the plant until September 3, it added.\n\nUkraine would be unable to ensure the security of the mission while in the plant, as it is Russian-held, Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said earlier Thursday, stressing that situation around the nuclear facility remains \"a mess.\"\n\nThe plant has endured constant shelling and raised fears of a nuclear accident. Metin Aktas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nA prolonged IAEA presence at the nuclear plant would likely help to stave off the possibility of a dangerous nuclear accident. Russia would welcome a permanent IAEA presence at the facility, its diplomat to the agency and other international organizations in Vienna said Wednesday.\n\nUkraines President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that he wants the IAEA to help strike a deal that would demilitarize Zaporizhzhia, rather than simply inspect the plant.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that Russia was doing everything it could so that the IAEA mission could safely carry out its work.\n\nFrequent shelling in and around the plant has raised fears about a nuclear accident. Both sides have accused the other of nuclear terrorism, with Ukraine alleging that the Kremlin is using the nuclear plant as cover to protect its troops and launch attacks.\n\nCNN is unable to verify who is responsible for the shelling.",

The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving - it's going to stay there,\" Mr Grossi said, once he had crossed back into Ukrainian-held territory.\n\nBut he did not specify how many people would be staying and for how long.\n\nRussia's Interfax news agency reported that around eight to 12 inspectors would stay on, while Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said five inspectors would stay.\n\nThe inspectors hope to assess the state of the plant and talk to Ukrainian workers under Russian control.\n\nMr Grossi said that battles taking place near the plant were \"not going to stop\" the inspection.\n\n\"There were moments where fire was obvious, heavy machine gun, artillery mortars, at two or three times [it was] really very concerning, I would say, for all of us,\" he said.\n\nThe IAEA's former chief inspector Olli Heinonen has told the BBC that if interviews do take place, workers are unlikely to be as \"open as they would like to be\" over the risks to the safety of themselves and their families.\n\nDuring his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he hoped the inspectors would \"draw objective conclusions,\" but lamented the absence of international journalists among the delegation.\n\n\"We have clear evidence that Russia did a lot of cynical things to deceive the mission,\" he added. \"The occupiers forced people to lie to the IAEA representatives - to hand over some papers, sign something, say something.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Zelensky's chief of staff accused Russia of trying to \"wreck\" the mission by shelling the nearby town of Enerhodar, which is under Moscow's control, and the facility.\n\n\"Criminals must be stopped,\" Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram, accusing Russia of acting like a \"terrorist state\".\n\nRussia refuted this, stating that 60 Ukrainian \"saboteurs\" who attempted to recapture the plant by crossing the river on Thursday morning were killed.\n\nThe EU is giving more than five million anti-radiation tablets to Ukraine, as fears grow of an accident at the plant.\n\nWhile recent fighting in the area has caused some damage to the plant, so far there has not been any recorded increase in radiation levels in the area.",

With a fourth in repairs, Thursday's incident leaves only one of the six reactors working.\n\nMardini said it was \"encouraging\" the IAEA team was going to inspect the plant because the stakes were \"immense\".\n\n\"When hazardous sites become battlegrounds, the consequences for millions of people and the environment can be catastrophic and last many years,\" he said.\n\nOn leaving Zaporizhzhia, the IAEA chief said his team would be travelling through areas where \"the risks are significant\" but had decided to go ahead anyway.\n\n\"We have to proceed with this. We have a very important mission to accomplish.\"\n\nShelling, saboteurs and back-to-school\n\nThe town of Energodar which is located next to the plant came under sustained attack at dawn, with Russian troops firing \"mortars and using automatic weapons and rockets\", its mayor Dmytro Orlov said on Telegram.\n\nBut Moscow accused Kyiv of smuggling in up to 60 military \"saboteurs\", saying they reached the area near the plant at dawn and that Russian troops had taken \"measures to annihilate the enemy\".\n\nGrossi has said the IAEA will seek to establish a \"permanent presence\" at the facility \"to prevent a nuclear accident and preserve the largest nuclear power plant in Europe\".\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of deploying hundreds of soldiers and storing ammunition at the plant.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian troops pressed ahead with a counter-offensive in the nearby region of Kherson to retake areas seized by Russia at the start of the invasion.\n\nIn its morning update, the presidency said \"heavy explosions continued for the last 24 hours\" across Kherson, while five people were killed and 12 others wounded in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nDespite the conflict, now in its seventh month, September 1 marked the start of a new school year for children across Ukraine.\n\nFigures from Ukraine's education ministry show 2,199 educational institutions have been damaged in the fighting, with 225 completely destroyed.\n\nJust over half of the 23,000 institutions surveyed by the ministry are equipped with bomb shelters, meaning they can physically reopen, while those without will only offer online learning.\n\nBut in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, all learning will be online due to constant Russian shelling, the mayor said last month, with a British charity charging Thursday that dozens of its schools had been \"targeted\".\n\nAn investigation by the Centre for Information Resilience found 41 institutions had been \"partially or completely destroyed\" with researchers finding the shelling \"was targeted, rather than a by-product of indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin denounced as \"ridiculous\" the decision by EU foreign ministers to suspend a 2007 visa facilitation deal with Russia over the Ukraine conflict.\n\nMinisters agreed the measure on Wednesday but stopped short of closing its borders to all Russians, as demanded by Ukraine.",

The United States top diplomat and the head of NATO noted the advances, but cautioned that the war is likely to drag on for months.\n\nUkraines military also said it launched new attacks on Russian pontoon bridges used to bring supplies across the Dnieper River to Kherson, one of the largest Russian-occupied cities, and the adjacent region. Ukrainian artillery and rocket strikes have left all the fixed bridges across the river unusable, the militarys southern command said.\n\nWATCH: Secretary of State Blinken makes surprise visit to Ukraine as more U.S. aid announced\n\nAnxiety increased about Europes largest nuclear power plant, which was operating in emergency mode Friday for the fifth straight day due to the war. That prompted the head of the U.N. atomic watchdog to call for the establishment of an immediate safety zone around the plant to prevent a nuclear accident.\n\nThe six-reactor Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant came under the control of Russian forces early in the war but is being operated by Ukrainian staff. The plant and surrounding areas have been repeatedly hit by shelling that Russia and Ukraine blame on each other. The last power line connecting the plant to the Ukrainian electricity grid was cut Monday, leaving the plant without an outside source of electricity. It is receiving power for its own safety systems from the only reactor out of six total that remains operational.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said it took control of the village of Volokhiv Yar in the Kharkiv region and aimed to advance toward strategically valuable town of Kupiansk, which would cut off Russian forces from key supply routes.\n\nPro-Russian authorities in the Kupiansk district announced that civilians were being evacuated toward the Russian-held region of Luhansk.\n\n\"The initial signs are positive and we see Ukraine making real, demonstrable progress in a deliberate way,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Brussels, a day after visiting Kyiv.\n\n\"But this is likely to go on for some significant period of time,\" he said. \"There are a huge number of Russian forces in Ukraine and unfortunately, tragically, horrifically, President (Vladimir) Putin has demonstrated that he will throw a lot of people into this at huge cost to Russia.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who met with Blinken, said the war is \"entering a critical phase.\"\n\nThe gains \"are modest and only the first successes of the counteroffensive of the Ukrainian army, but they are important both in terms of seizing the military initiative and raising the spirit of Ukrainian soldiers,\" Mykola Sungurovsky, a military analyst at the Razumkov Center in Kyiv, told The Associated Press.\n\nEnergoatom, Ukraines state nuclear operator, said Friday that repairs to outside electric lines at the Zaporizhzhia plant are impossible because of the shelling and that operating the plant in what is called an \"island\" status carries \"the risk of violating radiation and fire safety standards.\"\n\n\"Only the withdrawal of the Russians from the plant and the creation of a security zone around it can normalize the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Only then will the world be able to exhale,\" Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told Ukrainian TV.\n\nEarlier, Kotin told The Associated Press that the plants only operating reactor \"can be stopped completely\" at any moment and as a consequence, the only power source would be a diesel generator.\n\nThere are 20 generators on site and enough diesel fuel for 10 days. After that, about 200 tons of diesel fuel would be needed daily for the generators, which he said is \"impossible\" while the plant is occupied by Russian forces.\n\nRafael Mariano Grossi, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Friday that there was little likelihood of reestablishing reliable offsite power lines to the plant.\n\n\"This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious,\" Grossi said, calling for an \"immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area\" and the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone.\n\n\"This is the only way to ensure that we do not face a nuclear accident,\" he said.\n\nFighting continued Friday elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\nRussian planes bombed the hospital in the town of Velika Pysarivka, on the border with Russia, said Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of the Sumy region. he said the building was destroyed and there were an unknown number of casualties.\n\nWATCH: IAEA calls for demilitarized zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine\n\nIn the Donetsk region in the east one of two that Russia declared to be sovereign states at the outset of the war eight people were killed in the city of Bakhmut over the past day and the city is without water and electricity for the fourth straight day, said governor Pavlo Kyrylenko.\n\nFour people were killed in shelling in the Kharkiv region, two of them in the city of Kharkiv, Ukraines second-largest, according to governor Oleh Syniehubov. The shelling of the city continued Friday afternoon, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said, wounding 10 people, including three children.\n\nUkraine this week claimed to have regained control of more than 20 settlements in the Kharkiv region, including the small city of Balakliya. Social media posts showed weeping, smiling Balakliya residents embracing Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday refused to comment on the alleged retaking of Balakliya, redirecting all such questions to the Russian Defense Ministry.\n\nBut Vitaly Ganchev, the Russian-installed official in the Kharkiv region, confirmed Friday that \"Balakliya, in effect, is not under our control.\" Ganchev said \"tough battles\" were continuing in the city and that Russian forces were attempting to expel the Ukrainian troops.\n\nHelicopters and fighter jets streaked over the rolling plains of the eastern Donetsk region, with the jets heading in the direction of Izium, near where Ukrainian forces have been carrying out a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region. The jets fired flares while black smoke billowed in the distance.\n\nAssociated Press writer Elena Becatoros in the Donetsk region, Ukraine, and Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.",

It cannot stand.\"\n\nMr Grossi did not say whether Russia or Ukraine was responsible for the shelling, but said that it must stop immediately.\n\nBoth countries have blamed each other for fighting in the vicinity of the plant, which is close to the front line and has been occupied, along with Enerhodar, by the Russians since early in the invasion.\n\nMr Grossi, who visited the plant himself earlier this month, said he had learnt on Friday from his staff who are still there that a \"serious situation\" had developed overnight.\n\nHe said that power to the city of Enerhodar, home to most of the plant operators and their families, had been \"destroyed by shelling\". This has led to a \"complete power blackout in Enerhodar: no running water, no power, no sewage\", his statement explained.\n\n\"Given the increased and continued shelling, there is little likelihood of re-establishing reliable offsite power\", he continued, \"especially as the shelling continually and repeatedly damages the power infrastructure.\"\n\nIf the operator shuts down the only remaining reactor, the \"entire power plant would then be fully reliant on emergency diesel generators for ensuring vital nuclear safety and security functions\", Mr Grossi added.\n\nThe \"increasingly dire circumstances\" in Enerhodar could also impact essential staffing at the plant, he said.\n\nIn another development, Ukraine said it had retaken more than 1,000 sq km (385 sq miles) of territory in the south and the east from Russia over the past week.",

The Kharkiv campaign came as a surprise for Moscow, which had relocated many of its troops from the region to the south in expectation of a counter-offensive there.\n\nIn an awkward attempt to save face, the Russian Defence Ministry said Saturday the troops' withdrawal from Izyum and other areas was intended to strengthen Moscow's forces in the neighbouring Donetsk region to the south. The explanation sounded similar how Russia justified its pulling back from Kyiv earlier this year.\n\nIgor Strelkov, who led Russia-backed forces when the separatist conflict in the Donbas erupted in 2014, mocked the Russian Defence Ministry's explanation of the retreat, suggesting that handing over Russia's own territory near the border was a \"contribution to a Ukrainian settlement.\"\n\nWATCH | Ukraine forces Russian retreat from northeast region of country: Ukraine retakes swathes of territory from Russian forces Duration 4:11 Featured Video Ukraines military has taken back a reported 3,000 square kilometres of territory from Russian occupation in a few short days after a swift counteroffensive in the northeastern part of the country. It marks a major shift in the war after months of attrition.\n\nDespite Ukraine's gains, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the head of NATO warned Friday the war would likely drag on for months, urging the West to keep supporting Ukraine through what could be a difficult winter.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Ukrainian advances very encouraging.\n\n\"I'm proud that the U.S. and our allies have locked arms to support the Ukrainian people in this fight,\" Kaine said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"We and our allies must keep standing with Ukraine. Putin needs to recognize that the only way out is to end his failed war.\"\n\nNuclear plant still in peril\n\nWhile most attention was focused on the counter-offensive, Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, was reconnected to Ukraine's electricity grid, allowing engineers to shut down its last operational reactor to safeguard the plant amid the fighting.\n\nThe plant, one of the 10 biggest atomic power stations in the world, has been occupied by Russian forces since the early days of the war. Ukraine and Russia have traded blame for shelling around it.\n\nSince a Sept. 5 fire caused by shelling knocked the plant off transmission lines, the reactor was powering crucial safety equipment in so-called \"island mode\" an unreliable regime that left the plant increasingly vulnerable to a potential nuclear accident.\n\nWATCH | UN presses for safety zone at nuclear power plant: UN presses for safety zone around Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant Duration 4:41 Featured Video The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency has urged Russia and Ukraine to establish a 'nuclear safety and security protection zone' around the Zaporizhzhia power plant.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN nuclear watchdog that has two experts at the plant, welcomed the restoration of external power. But the agency's director-general, Rafael Grossi, said he remains \"gravely concerned about the situation at the plant, which remains in danger as long as any shelling continues.\"\n\nHe said talks have begun on establishing a safety and security zone around the plant.\n\nIn a call Sunday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron urged the withdrawal of Russian troops and weaponry from the plant in line with IAEA recommendations.",

                "cc_text": "The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called today for the creation of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the embattled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, warning the Security Council of a potential catastrophe should the facility sustain further physical assault amid reports of shelling.\n\n\"We are playing with fire,\" Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned, as he outlined the findings from the newly released report on the IAEAs \"historic\" Mission to Zaporizhzhia last week to assess the conditions a visit that resulted from \"painstaking\" efforts to corroborate facts observed over six months.\n\nLaying out the issues in stark terms, Mr. Grossi said the physical attacks sustained by the facility and that he personally assessed are simply unacceptable. Operators are working under \"extremely challenging\" circumstances. Military vehicles and equipment inside nuclear buildings must be removed so as not to interfere with the normal operations of the nuclear safety and security system.\n\nFurther, he said operating staff must be allowed to return to the plants routine line of authority an issue raised \"time and again\" since March, when the plant first became occupied. The off-site power line redundancy must be re-established. \"Without this, we could have a very serious nuclear accident,\" he stressed.\n\nHe pressed all parties to ensure the effective operation of supply chains, highlighting IAEA assistance and support programmes available to help re-establish them, as they did in Chernobyl. IAEA can also help monitor radiation systems, he said, stressing that all reliable means of communications must also be restored. \"We are ready to consult quickly with the parties,\" he said. The report is considered an interim step until longer-term measures can be put in place.\n\nIn line with those remarks, United Nations Secretary-General Antnio Guterres said any damage, whether intentional or not, to Europes largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia could spell catastrophe, adding that \"all steps must be taken to avoid such a scenario\".\n\nAs a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces must commit not to engage in any military activity towards or from the plant site, he said. It must not be a target or a platform for military operations. As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarized perimeter should be secured. Specifically, that would include a commitment by Russian forces to withdraw all military personnel and equipment from that perimeter, and a commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move into it.\n\nHe trusted that the IAEA experts now deployed to Zaporizhzhia would be able to carry out their work without hindrance, he said. \"All of us have a stake in the success of their critical mission.\"\n\nTaking the floor first in the ensuing debate, the Russian Federations representative said the visit offered IAEA an opportunity to see that the only threats were those from the shelling and sabotage by Ukrainian armed forces. This was evident in the Director Generals statement of concern over the plants physical integrity. \"It is important that you were able to see with your own eyes that, thanks to cooperation between ZNPP staff and the Russian armed forces protecting the station, it is functioning normally,\" he said.\n\nMost other delegations welcomed that the Mission could finally take place and that IAEA now has an ongoing presence at Zaporizhzhia, with Germanys delegate pointing out that his country, in its national capacity and as the Group of 7 President, was among those that pushed for the IAEA Mission to be deployed as a matter of urgency.\n\nThe United States representative stressed that, despite the Russian Federations \"song and dance\", the situation stems from that countrys 4 March seizure of the plant and conduct of military operations in its vicinity. He like several of his counterparts called on the Russian Federation to end all military operations and to return full control to Ukraine.\n\nAlbanias delegate wondered aloud about the motive of the Russian Federation to attack, overrun, occupy and militarize a nuclear power plant in another country. He also questioned why that country had not agreed to establish a secure perimeter in order to avoid any incidents.\n\nTo that point, the United Kingdoms representative underscored that the situation was akin to \"playing roulette with nuclear safety\". Describing the pressure under which the Plants staff were working, she said: \"They are no longer workers, but hostages being held at gunpoint.\"\n\nNorways delegate took a step further to equate the seizure of the plant with the hostage taking of an essential source of power supply. It is totally unacceptable that a nuclear plant has become a frontline in the Russian war against Ukraine, she said.\n\nCalling for an independent, impartial investigation to establish responsibility when military activity is damaging to nuclear facilities, Gabons representative stressed his delegation \"cannot be satisfied by half measures, given the scope of the danger\". Existing rules of nuclear security must be abided to in order to ensure that the site is safe.\n\nMexicos delegate urged the Agency to continue sharing with the Council any relevant information, expressing hope that IAEAs visit and permanent presence at the plant will foster early negotiations to end hostilities in Ukraine\n\nThe representative of India, meanwhile, issued calls for diplomacy, pointing to the successful export of grains from Ukraine and food and fertilizers from the Russian Federation to make her point. \"Differences can be resolved through sustained dialogue,\" she said.\n\nTo that idea, Ukraines representative countered that the only way to remove the nuclear threat is for the Russian Federation to withdraw its weapons and troops, and to return the station to the full legitimate control of his country. Under no circumstance has Ukraine ever used forceful military actions in relation to the plant, he insisted. Only by strengthening sanctions and officially recognizing the Russian Federation as a terrorist State, at all levels, will the situation be corrected.\n\nAlso speaking today were representatives of Brazil, Ireland, United Arab Emirates, China, Ghana, Kenya and France.\n\nThe meeting began at 3:05 p.m. and ended at 4:53 p.m.\n\nBriefings\n\nANTONIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said the United Nations Secretariat stated his proud support for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in its critical task to ensure the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Thanking all colleagues assisting in the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia, especially the 13 United Nations support and security professionals who played an essential role in the deployment of the IAEA Mission, he expressed grave concern about the situation in and around the plant, including reports of recent shelling.\n\n\"Lets tell it like it is,\" he said, stressing that any damage, whether intentional or not, to Europes largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia or to any other nuclear facility in Ukraine \"could spell catastrophe\", adding that \"all steps must be taken to avoid such a scenario\". Common sense and cooperation must guide the way forward. Any action that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant is unacceptable. All efforts to re-establish the plant as purely civilian infrastructure are vital.\n\nAs a first step, he said Russian and Ukrainian forces must commit not to engage in any military activity towards the plant site or from the plant site, emphasizing that the Zaporizhzhia facility and its surroundings must not be a target or a platform for military operations. As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarized perimeter should be secured. Specifically, that would include a commitment by Russian forces to withdraw all military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and a commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move into it.\n\nFor their part, operators at the plant must be able to carry out their responsibilities, and communications must be maintained, he continued. \"Now is the time to urgently agree on concrete measures to ensure the safety of the area,\" he said, expressing regret that the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons fell victim to the war in Ukraine. While its outcome document sought to address the safety and security of nuclear power plants in armed conflict zones, including in Ukraine, the Conference failed to reach consensus on how to strengthen the Treaty. Looking ahead, he trusted that the IAEA experts now deployed to Zaporizhzhia would be able to carry out their work without hindrance and contribute to ensuring lasting nuclear safety and security at the plant. \"All of us have a stake in the success of their critical mission,\" he said. \"Let us commit to do everything we can to support them.\"\n\nRAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), presenting the Agencys report on its visit last week to the Zaporizhzhia plant, described it as the result of \"painstaking\" efforts to corroborate facts observed over six months. He outlined the findings in the context of the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety, noting that the first pillar involves not violating a plants physical integrity. \"Unfortunately [] this continues to happen,\" he said. The physical attacks sustained by the facility and that he personally assessed are simply unacceptable. \"We are playing with fire,\" he warned. \"Something very, very catastrophic could take place.\" The report thus proposes the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone, limited to the perimeter and the plant itself.\n\nHe said the second safety pillar states that all safety and security systems and equipment should operate normally. However, IAEA experts observed that operators were operating under extremely challenging circumstances, together with military equipment and vehicles in various parts. The report recommends that military vehicles and equipment that are currently inside nuclear buildings should be removed so as not to interfere with the nuclear safety and security system.\n\nThe third pillar states that the operating staff must do their jobs without undue pressures, he continued, an issue that has been raised \"time and again\" since March, when the plant was first occupied. The report recommends that the operators be allowed to return to the plants routine line of authority and that an appropriate work environment be established. The fourth pillar off-site power supply is crucially important in that a nuclear plant without external power supply may lose functionality, including for the cooling of the reactors and spent fuel. \"Without this, we could have a very serious nuclear accident,\" he pointed out. IAEA recommends that off-site power line redundancy be re-established and available at any time, and that all military activities be stopped immediately.\n\nHe said the fifth safety pillar involves uninterrupted logistical supply chains and transport to and from the site. Explaining that the Zaporizhzhia plant is the largest in Europe, requiring a constant flow of spare parts and other equipment, he recommended that all parties contribute to ensuring effective supply chains. Through IAEA assistance and support programmes, flows of supplies had been significantly re-established at Chernobyl. A similar mechanism could be applied in Zaporizhzhia, he said.\n\nOn the sixth pillar involving radiation monitoring systems he said IAEA equipment monitoring has been effective. The report recommends that the site continue ensuring this functionality, including through exercises that IAEA can help to perform. The seventh pillar states that there must be continued and reliable communications with the Ukrainian regulator. \"Weve seen, repeatedly, that these lines of communications have been interrupted,\" he said. IAEA recommends that reliable communications means and channels be secure at all times.\n\nHe described last weeks Mission as \"historic\", as it allowed IAEA to undertake a neutral, technical reading of the situation. The fact that IAEA inspectors remain at the site offers enormous value for the United Nations and international community in evaluating immediate conditions on the ground. \"This fact is unprecedented,\" he said, explaining that IAEA visits to areas undergoing difficult circumstances, such as Fukushima, had always been done \"after the fact, to pick up the pieces\". At Zaporizhzhia, by agreeing to a special safety and security protection zone, there is an opportunity to prevent certain events from happening. \"We are ready to consult quickly with the parties,\" he said, adding that the report is considered an interim step until longer-term measures can be put in place.\n\nStatements\n\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) said the IAEA visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant allowed the IAEA Director General and his team to personally assess the situation and make sure that the seven principles of safety are strictly adhered to by the Russian Federation. \"It is important that you were able to see with your own eyes that, thanks to cooperation between ZNPP staff and the Russian armed forces protecting the station, it is functioning normally and there are no internal threats to its security,\" he said. Moreover, the visit was an excellent opportunity to see that the only threats to the plant are from the shelling and sabotage from the Ukrainian armed forces. This was seen in the conclusion at the Director-Generals briefing when he said that the Agency is most concerned by the physical security and integrity of the station, the risks for which have increased due to the shelling in August. However, it was regrettable that, in the report on the safeguards implementation in Ukraine from April to September this year, the source of shelling was not directly named. While his delegation understands the Director-Generals position as head of an international regulator, in the current situation it is extremely important to call things by their name, he said.\n\nJEFFREY DELAURENTIS ( United States ) welcomed the Agencys technical report and added his support for the inspectors to continue to have unhindered and safe access to the facility. The Russian Federation should let Ukraine operators carry out all measures that they deem important to operate the plant and maintain its safety, he said, stressing that the danger is enormous. He also voiced his support for Ukraines call for demilitarization of the area surround the facility. Calling for the Russian Federation to withdraw from Ukraine, he said that despite that countrys \"song and dance\", it has no right to expose the world to unnecessary risks. The situation is a result of the Russian Federations unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and its 4 March seizure of the plant. Russian troops continue to conduct military operations around the plant, which in turn create an increased risk of a disaster. Also of concern was the disconnection of the external power line over the weekend, he noted, adding that for now, it is generating enough power to operate its cooling system. He called on the Russian Federation to end all military operations around the plant and return full control to Ukraine. Underscoring that there is no excuse for a nuclear incident, he also voiced his rejection of all attempts of the Russian Federation to take power from Ukraines electric grid. The Russian Federation alone is responsible for this crisis and can resolve it. It must respect the Charter and Ukraines sovereignty and integrity.\n\nBARBARA WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ) welcomed IAEAs ongoing presence at the Zaporizhzhia plant and thanked Ukraine for facilitating the Agencys visit. The physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times. With the publication of todays report, IAEA confirmed the presence of Russian military personnel, vehicles and equipment in the plant, she said, recalling that Russian military equipment has been as close as 60 metres from the nuclear reactors. The report also confirmed the immense pressure under which the Ukrainian staff are operating. \"They are no longer workers, but hostages being held at gunpoint,\" she insisted. By choosing to invade a nuclear power plant, the Russian Federation is \"playing roulette with nuclear safety\", she added. Any measures to ensure nuclear safety should involve the full withdrawal of Russian troops and personnel. Stressing that the situation at Zaporizhzhia is entirely of the Russian Federations making, she pointed out that its invasion has disrupted facilities across Ukraine and jeopardized the safety of millions. The Russian Federation can resolve the situation by immediately withdrawing its forces from all of Ukraine and ceasing its senseless, reckless aggression.\n\nRONALDO COSTA FILHO ( Brazil ) said the Agencys Mission to the Zaporizhzhia plant was a positive development amid a conflict in which good news has been rare. The presence of IAEA inspectors allows the international community to know the real dimension of risks to the nuclear installations safety. Avoiding a nuclear catastrophe must be a priority, he said, adding: \"We find it extremely concerning that the physical integrity of the plant has been violated repeatedly in recent weeks.\" More worrying is that the prospect that an IAEA Mission was not enough to stop the bombings. He repeated an appeal for the immediate suspension of all actions that could jeopardize the security of Zaporizhzhia before damage to the plant results in irreparable consequences to human lives, the environment and the regions safety. Attacks on nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes violate the Charter of the United Nations, international law and the Statute of the IAEA. He reminded parties of their responsibilities under multilateral instruments, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel, and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its amendment.\n\nFERIT HOXHA ( Albania ), noting that Member States know the origin of the problem, asked: \"What is the business of Russia to attack, overrun, occupy and militarize a nuclear power plant in another country? Who is responsible in the first place that there is fighting in the surroundings of the power plant? Why has Russia not answered for demilitarizing that plant, hand it over to those it belongs Ukraine and agree to establish a secure perimeter in order to avoid any incidents?\" A clear and straightforward answer to those questions would help provide more clarity, he said, calling on the Russian Federation to withdraw its military forces and all other unauthorized personnel from the Zaporizhzhia plant, its immediate surroundings, and all of Ukraine. Voicing concern that the widespread infrastructure damage and loss of off-site electricity could damage the cooling systems and lead to a nuclear meltdown, he condemned any act of violence perpetrated inside or near the plant or against its personnel. He also called for the immediate implementation of the IAEAs recommendation to establish a secure perimeter around that facility and other nuclear facilities in Ukraine.\n\nCAIT MORAN ( Ireland ) said she welcomed the Director-Generals intention to maintain an ongoing IAEA presence at the plant. Emphasizing that the Agency has a key role in helping Ukraine uphold nuclear safety and security, she expressed concern by the situation at the plant, including the ongoing military activity and shelling. She urged the Russian Federation to stop its efforts to disconnect the plant from the main Ukrainian grid, which creates a significant risk of a catastrophic radiological incident. The Director-General has again clearly laid out the importance of the seven pillars of nuclear safety and security and how these are being flouted at Zaporizhzhia, due to the Russian Federations actions. She called on the Russian Federation and, indeed, all States to fully commit themselves to those seven pillars, for all nuclear facilities and materials, including in situations of armed conflict. \"If Russia is serious about safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, it must end its illegal occupation of the site and withdraw its troops and munitions,\" she said. It is essential so Ukrainian authorities, with the IAEA, can uphold their responsibilities for safety and security at the site.\n\nTRINE SKARBOEVIK HEIMERBACK ( Norway ) said IAEAs continued presence at the Zaporizhzhia plant cannot be overstated. Commending the Ukrainian staff who continue to operate the plant under occupation by Russian forces, she called on the Russian Federation to return full control to its Ukrainian operator. Safety and security conditions at Zaporizhzhia have deteriorated solely because of the Russian Federations aggression, she said, emphasizing that it is totally unacceptable that a nuclear plant has become a frontline in the Russian war against Ukraine. Noting that IAEA identified the urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster, she said this can be achieved through the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. She reaffirmed the importance of the seven IAEA pillars and expressed support for the Agencys efforts to ensure their implementation in Ukraine. She also voiced particular concern over the seizure of the plant as a means of taking hostage an essential source of electricity supply for Ukraine, stressing that the power rightly belongs to the people of Ukraine. Any attempts to disconnected it from the Ukrainian grid are unacceptable. The Russian Federations aggression has aggravated global food insecurity, affecting the most vulnerable the hardest, she added.\n\nRUCHIRA KAMBOJ ( India ), voicing appreciation for the IAEAs recent visit to Ukraine, said her country continues to carefully follow developments regarding the safety and security of Ukraines nuclear power reactors and facilities. The Agencys discharge of its safeguards and monitoring activities, in accordance with its Statute in an effective, non-discriminatory and efficient manner, is of high priority to her delegation. There must be a strict mutual restraint so as not to endanger the safety and security of nuclear facilities and personnel working there. Since the beginning of the conflict, her country has consistently called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and an end to violence. She urged both sides to return to the path of diplomacy and dialogue, voicing support for all diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. She welcomed the Secretary-General-backed initiative to open the exports of grains from Ukraine via the Black Sea and the facilitation of the exports of Russian food and fertilizers, noting that those efforts demonstrate that differences can be resolved through sustained dialogue and diplomacy.\n\nMOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB ( United Arab Emirates ), emphasizing that the IAEAs Mission marked a crucial first step to assessing the safety of Ukraines nuclear facilities, voiced his hope that this spirit of technical cooperation will be extended to all such facilities in Ukraine. Expressing concern that the plants physical integrity has been violated several times, he underscored the need for measures to be put in place to prevent an accident that could arise from the physical damage. The recent news that the plant was disconnected from the grid due to a fire caused by shelling is a \"serious concern\", he stressed, underscoring the critical importance of de-escalation. Disruption of the external power supply could have disastrous consequences. He recalled that nuclear plants are afforded special protection under international humanitarian law; such protections must be upheld. Calling on both sides to ensure the seven IAEA pillars are respected, he expressed alarm that all seven have been compromised. Going forward, the continued presence of IAEA inspectors will remain essential, he said, calling for the cessation of hostilities and a diplomatic end to the conflict.\n\nMICHEL XAVIER BIANG ( Gabon ) voiced concern about reports of several violations to the physical integrity of the nuclear power plant and disruption in electric supply. It is crucial and urgent to restore and preserve the physical integrity of the power station, he stressed, condemning any and all use or threat to use a nuclear facility for military purposes. He called for a cessation of all military activity within or near the nuclear power plant, noting that parties to the conflict must abstain from any attack against the site. He also called for an independent and impartial investigation to establish responsibility for all military activity when it is damaging to nuclear facilities. Parties to the conflict must abide by existing rules of nuclear security and cooperate with IAEA in a transparent manner to ensure that the site is safe. \"We cannot be satisfied by half measures given the scope of the danger,\" he said, stressing that good-faith negotiations must continue in order to put an end to the war. He encouraged all initiatives aimed at bringing parties to the negotiating table to stop the hostilities.\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ) said the safety and security of the Zaporizhzhia plant has been nerve-wracking for the international community. Noting that the Agencys inspectors were able to carry out an objective inspection, he said he was pleased with the positive developments. However, despite repeated warnings, the shelling has continued, even after the inspectors had arrived. \"This is truly worrying,\" he said. Pointing out that the Chernobyl nuclear accident has not faded into memory, he emphasized that the world cannot afford another nuclear disaster. He called on all parties to act rationally and safely and to implement the seven pillars proposed by the Agencys Director-General. He expressed his support for the inspectors long-term presence and said he hoped they can provide technical and safe support. He also encouraged the Agency to maintain its communication with relevant parties. The international community should step up diplomatic efforts to help achieve a ceasefire, with all parties adopting a safe approach to jointly maintain global security.\n\nJUAN RAMN DE LA FUENTE RAMREZ ( Mexico ) said ensuring the smooth security and operation of the Zaporizhzhia plant is essential in order to avoid a disaster. He called for avoiding any action that risks its physical integrity and that of IAEA experts, underscoring Mexicos confidence in their impartiality. He voiced concern that the seven pillars are not being fully respected in the area, cautioning that any attack against a nuclear installation is a violation of international law. He urged the Agency to continue sharing with the Council any relevant information, expressing hope that IAEAs visit and permanent presence at the plant will foster early negotiations to end hostilities in Ukraine. With that, he reiterated Mexicos commitment to do its utmost to promote a diplomatic solution to end the war.\n\nHAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN ( Ghana ) said todays briefing reinforced his continuing concern about the rapidly escalating risk of a radioactive exposure resulting from the militarization of the Zaporizhzhia plant and the surrounding area. After the unrelenting shellfire at the facility on 25 August, which led to a temporary loss of the main power supply to the nuclear reactors, he said he was equally concerned to learn that the plants main connection to the power grid was lost on Saturday due to sustained shelling. These incidents compromise the cooling and safe functioning of the plant and elevate the risks of accidental or deliberate radioactive exposure. He added his full endorsement of the IAEAs position that, pending the conflicts end and the re-establishment of stable conditions, interim measures will be urgently needed to prevent a nuclear accident due to physical damage caused by military action. He also welcomed the permanent presence of the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia at the facility and urged the parties to cooperate fully with the team. It is crucial for the Russian Federation to heed international calls for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its forces from the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine and to pave the way for meaningful engagement between the parties towards a peaceful settlement.\n\nMICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO ( Kenya ) said as State party to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, Kenya upholds the treatys aims: to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology; to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear energy; and to further disarmament. He expressed his deep concern regarding the fragile nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine, particularly at the Zaporizhzhia plant. He welcomed the presence of the IAEA team there and urged full support and cooperation for them. The parties concerned must exercise restraint, act with caution, refrain from any action that may compromise nuclear safety and security, and work to minimize the possibility of accidents. He called for an immediate cessation of the war through diplomatic tools to spare further suffering for the Ukrainian people and he reaffirmed Kenyas respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\n\nNICOLAS DE RIVIRE ( France ), Council President for September, spoke in his national capacity to say that for several weeks, his country has been mobilized at the highest level to facilitate the deployment of IAEA experts to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. President Emmanuel Macron and the Minister for Foreign Affairs received the IAEA Director-General in Paris to express their full support, he reported, also highlighting the constructive role played by the Ukrainian authorities to ensure that the mission takes place in the best possible conditions. Voicing concern about the conclusions shared by IAEA, he said strikes and shelling near and from the plant must cease. In addition, all Russian military personnel and equipment must be removed from the plant immediately, he stressed, calling for the plants demilitarization. Moreover, Ukrainian personnel operating the plant must be able to carry out its mission without threat or pressure. Ukrainian sovereignty over the Zaporizhzhia plant must be respected. The Russian Federation must return full control of the plant to Ukraine, as well as of all nuclear installations in Ukraine, and put an end to its attempts to divert the electricity produced at the plant to its illegally occupied territories.\n\nMr. GROSSI said he valued all the delegates comments, noting that they were a tremendous source of encouragement. Nonetheless, the purpose of the Mission was not only to produce reports, though reports are indispensable, but to get things done and improve the situation. He also said he was glad that the delegates recognized the seven pillars and supported an initiative for interim measures to protect the safety and security of the plant through a protection zone. Thus, as important as what was in the report, what is more important is what will come next, he stressed. In that regard, he said he will soon approach the relevant parties with concrete elements for their consideration to move forward in the next logical step. The first step is the immediate protection to the plant, he noted, adding that he was always at the Councils disposal and will continue to count on the Secretary-Generals support for Agency personnel. He appealed to all to work together on the protection of the Zaporizhzhia plant and to help establish a protection zone.\n\nSERGIY KYSLYTSYA ( Ukraine ), expressing his appreciation for the bravery and professionalism of the IAEA experts, said that their visit is only the first step. The plant remains under occupation; the Russian military equipment and weapons are still deployed at the site; and armed provocations continue. The only way to remove the nuclear threat is the withdrawal of the Russian weaponry and troops and the return of the station to the full legitimate control of Ukraine. This is a key prerequisite for restoring nuclear safety and security and respect for international law. He also said he remained concerned that the Ukrainian staff was working under conditions of threats and pressure by the Russians. The IAEA verified the Ukraine delegations assertions during previous Council meetings that it was the Russian Federations practice to use the plant as a shield for its personnel and hardware. The issue now under discussion, the continuous presence of the IAEA at the plant, was put forward by Ukraine, which is ready for immediate substantive consultations with the IAEA on the modalities of the Agencys continuous presence at the plant to stabilize the critical situation and avoid future aggravation.\n\nHe re-confirmed that under no circumstance has Ukraine ever resorted to forceful military actions in relation to the plant, which endangers Ukraine and millions of lives in neighbouring countries. Yesterday, the last power transmission line that connected the station to Ukraines energy system was damaged, he said, adding: \"This is the second time, due to Russian provocation, that the Zaporizhzhia station was one step away from nuclear disaster.\" He went on to cite President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy, who said yesterday: \"We consider the fact that Russia is doing this right now, right on the eve of the IAEA conclusions, very eloquent.\" He further cited the Presidents remarks, adding that the Russian Federation only wants the situation to remain the worst for the longest time. Only by strengthening sanctions and only by officially recognizing Russia as a terrorist state, at all levels, will the situation be corrected.\n\nThe main outcome of the joint international efforts must be the withdrawal of the Russian military and civilian personnel from the plants territory, as well as from Enerhodar, he continued. This will definitely bring the plant to its safe and secure operation, as it was before the Russian Federations war against Ukraine. As stated in the IAEA report, \"the current situation is untenable and the best action to ensure the safety and security of Ukraines nuclear facilities and its people would be for the armed conflict to end now,\" he said.",

The mission comprised IAEA nuclear safety, security, and safeguards staff. (Photo credit: D. Candano Laris/IAEA)\n\nOn Thursday, experts of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UNs nuclear watchdog, reached the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine for what is the riskiest mission of the agencys history. Shortly before departing for the plant from Kyiv, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told journalists: \"We are aware of the current situation. There has been increased military activity, including a few minutes ago. But weighing the pros and cons, and having come so far, we are not stopping.\" Wearing a blue bulletproof vest stamped \"United Nations,\" Grossi added: \"We are moving now, accepting the risks are very, very high,\" commenting ahead of their trip across the front line.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, was seized by Russian forces in March and has since then raised fears of a nuclear accident due to a power outage, human error, or military mistake. On August 25, the plant was temporarily disconnected from the power grid after fires caused by shelling cut the last power line connecting the plant to Ukraines grid system. The incident forced the automatic shutdown of reactors 5 and 6 and triggered the emergency diesel generators to maintain the cooling of the reactor core and spent fuel pools and prevent a nuclear accident. It was the first time in nearly 40 years of operation that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from the grid.\n\nOn Thursday morningonly hours before IAEA experts headed to Zaporizhzhiathe plant was forced again to trigger emergency systems, shutting down reactor 5 after shelling struck a 330-kV backup power line.\n\nThe mission comes after a month-long of intense negotiations and pressure by the international community to have Russia and Ukraine let an IAEA mission inspect the plants physical integrity, staff conditions, and safety and security systems. Earlier this August, a Russian diplomat said that it was too dangerous for an IAEA mission to pass through the capital city of Kyiv. But on August 23, the UNs Security Council announced that it had gathered the necessary logistics and security capabilities to support an IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia plant from Kyiv, provided Russia and Ukraine agree. On Monday, Grossi announced that he would lead such a mission.\n\nOfficially called IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ), the effort consists of a 14-member team of nuclear safety, security, and safeguards staff, including IAEAs chief. \"We have a very important mission to accomplish,\" Grossi said on Thursday. It was not clear however what the experts would be looking at during their mission. Earlier on that day, Grossi commented that he and his team of experts will work on \"a detailed analysis of some of the more technical aspects,\" without specifying what those aspects were.\n\nAnother doubt concerned the extent of the IAEAs mission. Russia reportedly has been hiding heavy military equipment at the plants premises. It was not clear whether experts would be allowed to inspect all buildings. In photos of the visit released by the IAEA, Grossi and the other mission members are seen taking notes as they tour the facility and talking to employees of Energoatom, Ukraines state nuclear company. There was no sign of Russian troops or military equipment. In one picture, IAEA staff are seen next to what is believed to be an emergency diesel generator, like those triggered on the same day.\n\nAfter his visit, Grossi said: \"It is obvious the physical integrity of the plant has been violated, several times. This is a reality that cannot continue to happen.\" But it is not clear how the IAEA can help reduce the risk of a nuclear accident. The agency has no authority to order a cease-fire or create a demilitarized zone.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Grossi tweeted, as he was completing his first visit, that the IAEA will stay and establish a permanent presence at the plant. \"We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving,\" Grossi said after he returned to Ukrainian-held territory.",

Some members of the inspection team left after spending several hours there. Ukraine's nuclear power operator Energoatom said five team members would stay on for two more days.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have accused each other of trying to sabotage the IAEA mission to the plant, which sits on the south bank of a huge reservoir on the Dnipro River that divides Russian and Ukrainian forces in central southern Ukraine. Since the early days of the conflict, the plant has been controlled by Russian troops but operated by Ukrainian staff.\n\nConditions at the plant have been unravelling for weeks, with Moscow and Kyiv regularly trading blame for shelling in the vicinity, fuelling fears of a Chornobyl-style radiation disaster.\n\nKyiv also accuses Moscow of using the Russian-controlled plant as a shield for its weapons, which Russia denies, and of planning to switch it from Ukraine's power grid to Russia's, effectively stealing its output.\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was doing everything to ensure that the plant could operate safely, and for the IAEA inspectors to be able to complete their tasks.\n\n\"In the event of further attempts by Kyiv to disrupt their work with shelling or sabotage, the entire responsibility for the consequences will fall entirely on the Zelenskiy regime and its handlers and their 'support group' in the West,\" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement, referring to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nEarlier, Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said Russian shelling had forced the shutdown of one of the two reactors still operating at the site, while Moscow said it had thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to seize the plant. read more\n\nA Reuters reporter in the nearby Russian-controlled town of Enerhodar said a residential building was struck by shelling, forcing people to take cover in a basement.

But this first segment is going to take a few days,\" Grossi had said.\n\n'SLOW PROCESS'\n\nBoth sides have claimed battlefield successes in the new Ukrainian push to recapture territory in the south, although details have been scarce so far, with Ukrainian officials releasing little information about their advance.\n\n\"It is a very slow process, because we value people,\" said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskiy, referring to the Ukrainian offensive. Moscow has denied reports of Ukrainian progress and said its troops had routed Ukrainian forces.\n\nMillions of people have fled Ukraine, thousands have been killed and cities have been reduced to rubble in what Kyiv and the West call Russia's unprovoked war of agression.

Credit Credit... Leonhard Foeger/Reuters\n\nZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine The gravest risk to the embattled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is physical damage to equipment from shelling that could lead to a release of radiation, the director of the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency said Friday after a visit to the site.\n\nOther risks abound, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters in Vienna, a day after inspecting the nuclear station in southern Ukraine. The plant has been repeatedly hit by artillery. Loss of external power to cool reactor cores and stress on the operating staff also pose dangers, he said.\n\n\"It is obvious there is a lot of fighting in general in this part of Ukraine,\" Mr. Grossi said. \"The military activity and operations are increasing in that part of the country, and this worries me a lot.\"\n\nMr. Grossi said two United Nations experts would remain at the plant to independently assess its safety going forward.\n\nMost of the damage from the war at the sprawling station, which is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, occurred during shelling in August, Mr. Grossi said, unless one considers the destruction from the battle in March when the Russian Army captured the site.\n\nThis year the Zaporizhzhia plant, nestled in a gentle valley of farm fields in a once sleepy and provincial corner of Ukraine that is now a site of raging battles along a front line, became the first active nuclear plant to be caught in a combat zone in the history of civilian nuclear power.\n\nNot one of what the nuclear monitoring agency calls the seven pillars of nuclear safety, which include physical integrity, reliable external power and availability of spare parts, remains intact, Mr. Grossi said. The plant has six reactors and before the war provided 30 percent of Ukraines electricity.\n\nBut on some points the agencys initial assessment was more optimistic than the picture painted by Ukrainian officials, who had said that engineers and other employees had been subjected to harsh interrogation and even torture, raising stress levels when they returned to work in reactor control rooms and in other critical jobs.\n\nMr. Grossi said that he had spoken with the Ukrainian employees and that they had found a way to cooperate what he called \"cohabitation\" with the Russian soldiers and nuclear experts also at the site. \"The plant continues to operate, and there is a professional modus vivendi, if I can put it that way,\" he said.\n\nBefore the visit, Ukrainian officials had said the agency should discount anything employees at the plant said, arguing they are essentially hostages.\n\nMr. Grossi said the Ukrainian and Russian nuclear engineers had managed to \"cope\" in operating the site and that he was less worried about disruptions in regulatory oversight and supplies of spare parts, while these problems also loomed as risks. He spoke after he and a team of inspectors crossed a front line in Russias war in Ukraine to conduct an inspection. Their mission was delayed by artillery strikes on their planned route, part of a swirl of chaotic violence in and around the station.\n\nMr. Grossi said his assessment was bound to disappoint both sides for declining to place blame on one or another army for the shells hitting the plant.\n\n\"I dont want to pretend what we are doing will end this terrible war or give back this plant to Ukraine,\" he said. The mission was limited to gauging nuclear safety, something he said the two-man team remaining at the site would do.\n\n\"Now, when there is an allegation that something has happened at the plant, you can turn to us,\" he said, rather than weighing the conflicting claims of Russia and Ukraine. \"Thats the difference.\" He said Russian soldiers had not blocked access to areas of the site he asked to visit.\n\nAsked to compare the potential fallout from a radiation release at Zaporizhzhia with the fire and meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986, which spread radiation around Europe in the worlds worst civilian nuclear accident, Mr. Grossi said designs of the two power stations were not comparable. Zaporizhzhias reactors have containment vessels to limit radiation release. But he said disruptions in external power to cool reactor cores could lead to a meltdown.\n\n\"It could be a big thing or a small thing, depending on the damage\" from the fighting, he said.",

Ammar Awad/Reuters\n\nRussian shelling killed four Ukrainian civilians in Donetsk Province over the weekend, offering a grim reminder of the continuous battle in the countrys east even as the wars focus has shifted to the south.\n\nThe governor for Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Sunday that two people had been killed a day earlier in the village of Velyka Novosilka, which is about 60 miles west of the regional capital. Shelling also killed one person in the city of Siversk, which is north of Donetsk, and another in the village of Vodiane, Mr. Kyrylenko said. Two people were wounded.\n\nMr. Kyrylenko added in a post on the Telegram messaging app that 797 civilians have died and more than 20,000 have been wounded in the Donetsk region since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.\n\nBut Ukraines new attempt to regain ground in the southern province of Kherson, which was lost to Moscow at the start of the war, has shifted the dynamics in the east.\n\nAfter failing to capture Ukraines capital early in the war, Russian forces switched focus to try to seize control of the eastern Donbas region, which is made up of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces. They had captured nearly all of Luhansk by early July of this year, but their efforts since to take control of neighboring Donetsk have stalled.\n\nThat is in part because of a weekslong pause by Moscow in its offensive to rotate and refresh troops, but also because Ukraine has been preparing defensive positions in Donetsk since 2014 when rebels loyal to Russia seized government buildings there and in Luhansk, beginning a long trench war with Ukrainian forces that are difficult to dislodge. Ukrainian attacks on Russian ammunition depots and other supply points behind the front lines, using longer-range artillery supplied by Western countries, have also slowed Russias advances in Donetsk.\n\nNow, an uptick in fighting in Kherson has changed the calculus for both sides in Donetsk.\n\n\"As Ukraine tries to make advances in Kherson and the Russian military fights and tries to defend that territory, the rest of the Russian forces attempt to make incremental advances on Donbas,\" Michael Kofman, director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for a New American Security, said on the War on the Rocks podcast.\n\nThere are signs that Moscow might reinforce its troops in the east to renew its stalled campaign. Ukrainian military intelligence has said in recent days that the Russian armys newest grouping the 3rd Army Corps will likely be deployed to Donbas.\n\nIt would be the first major new formation of troops to be dispatched by the Kremlin since it launched a campaign in July to bring in new recruits though military analysts have questioned the groupings combat readiness.\n\n\"Images of the 3rd Army Corps elements have shown the volunteers to be physically unfit and old,\" a recent analysis by the Institute for the Study of War said.\n\nAnalysts say that fighting in eastern Ukraine will almost certainly stretch into next year. A likely hiatus in offensive operations in the winter will give both sides an opportunity to train new forces, and so it will be critical for Ukraine to force Russia to commit new troops just to hold its current positions, the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank that specializes in security issues, said in a report.\n\nThe United States government estimated in July that 15,000 Russians had been killed since February and said that Ukraine had also suffered significant losses. On Sunday, Britains ministry of defense said in an intelligence update that Russian troops were continuing to suffer from low morale.\n\n\"With the prospect of a bitter winter spent outdoors, there is ample opportunity to ensure that Russias forces remain cold, wet, hungry, miserable and therefore vulnerable to shock and a collapse in morale,\" the report said.",

But after Ukrainian forces recaptured Bucha on March 31, a large amount of documentation emerged of what U.S. officials later said could be evidence of horrific war crimes.\n\nMeanwhile, in addition to learning about the brutality that was visited on civilians in these occupied areas, the advance has also allowed Ukraine to begin the process of stabilizing the liberated territories, much of which has been destroyed by war.\n\nA destroyed vehicle outside a destroyed gas station in Kharkiv Oblast territory recaptured by Ukrainian armed forces.

Ukraine always fulfills its social obligations to people.\"\n\nBefore we get to the latest, get caught up on The War Zones previous rolling coverage of the war in Ukraine by clicking here.\n\nThe Latest\n\nIn addition to the gains Ukraine has made in its Kharkiv counteroffensive, there is also progress being made in the south as well, the Institute for the Study of War said in its latest assessment.\n\n\"Ukraines southern counteroffensive is continuing to have significant impacts on Russian morale and military capabilities in southern Ukraine,\" said the ISW assessment. \"Satellite imagery of known Russian positions in Kyselivka, 15km northwest of Kherson City, shows that all but four Russian vehicles have departed from previous forward positions, consistent with rumors that Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) troops have abandoned Kyselivka and moved back towards the Dnipro River.\"\n\nKyselivka is an operationally significant location for Russian forces around Kherson City \"because it is the last major settlement along both the E58 highway and a railway line between current Ukrainian positions and Chornobaivka, the outermost part of Kherson City. The apparent withdrawal of Russian troops from this position may compromise the Russians ability to defend the northwestern outskirts of Kherson City and suggests that Russian troops in this area perceive an imminent threat to their positions.\"\n\nNatalya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraines Southern Operational Command, stated on September 12 that Russian forces located along the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast \"are attempting to negotiate for surrender under the auspices of international law,\" ISW reported. \"Ukrainian operations in Kharkiv Oblast are unlikely to have had such a dramatic psychological effect on Russian troops this far south, and both the withdrawal of troops from forward positions in Kyselivka and reports of surrender negotiations are indicators that Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south are progressing in a significant way, even if visibility on this axis is limited by the shift in focus to Kharkiv.\"\n\nISW listed several key takeaways from the Ukrainian advances to date.\n\nUkrainian forces are continuing to make impactful gains in Kherson Oblast and are steadily degrading the morale and combat capabilities of Russian forces in this area.\n\nThe Russian military command may be suspending the deployment of newly formed units to Ukraine due to recent Russian losses and overall degraded morale.\n\nRussian forces are failing to reinforce the new frontline following Ukrainian gains in eastern Kharkiv Oblast and are actively fleeing the area or redeploying to other axes.\n\nUkrainian forces continued targeting Russian military assets and positions in Kherson Oblast, likely steadily degrading them.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced the restoration of the second reserve power transmission line to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).\n\nUkraines sweeping counteroffensive is damaging Russian administrative capabilities and driving Russian departures from occupied parts of Ukraine far behind the line of contact.\n\nThe Ukrainian recapture of Izyum has likely degraded Russian forces ability to conduct artillery strikes along the Izyum-Slovyansk highway.\n\nA Russian soldier, taken prisoner, on a tank with Ukrainian soldiers after the city was recaptured from Russian forces on September 11, 2022 in Izyum, Ukraine.

Pat Ryder, the Pentagon's top spokesman, said Ukraine's rapid advance is no surprise to the U.S.\n\n\"Well, certainly since the beginning of Russia's invasion into Ukraine, we've seen the Ukrainians demonstrate a remarkable adaptability and ability to use their warfighting capabilities to great effect,\" he said. \"So it's not surprising to us that they have pushed as quickly as they have. And the current counter-offensive in Kharkiv is no exception to that. I think if anyone was surprised, just based on the reports that we've seen in terms of the Russian military's response, it was probably the Russians.\"\n\nWhile much has been made about Russian war losses in terms of personnel and equipment, far less is known about Ukraine's attrition.\n\nUkrainian soldiers shelter from a mortar attack, in Bohorodychne village in Kramatorsk, Donetsk region, on September 13, 2022, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

As we've said previously, we do provide time-sensitive information to enable them to conduct operations and defend their homeland. I'm not going to get into the specifics of what that might look like.\"\n\nAnd he deferred to the Ukrainians any comment about whether they have enough troops to hold the territory they've recaptured.\n\n\"As always, any battlefield is a dynamic and fluid place,\" he said. \"We will continue to monitor from our end and continue to keep our focus on supporting them in terms of the equipment and the resources that they need.\"\n\nThe U.S. military is not just monitoring the war, however. It is also taking lessons from Ukrainian successes, as is evident by this slide below from a Tuesday briefing at Fort Benning by Army Chief of Staff Gen. James C. McConville.\n\nThese are lessons apparently unheeded by Russia. But despite its losses on the battlefield, Moscow is apparently not considering a full-on mobilization to backfill its fallen troops and destroyed or seized equipment. So said Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov in comments to reporters.\n\nStill, things are going so poorly for Russia that Moscow is claimed to be seeking to negotiate its way out of the full-on war it started on Feb. 24. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishnya told France24 that Russian officials sought to negotiate with Ukraine in recent days. It was a move she said she believed was aimed at stopping the rapid Ukrainian advances. Once again, this is an uncorroborated but official claim and should be treated as such.\n\nZelensky has repeatedly expressed little interest of late in talking to Russia until they leave Ukraine to the borders that existed prior to 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea and invaded Donbas. Some Russians, however, seem not to be waiting for negotiations to start before leaving. Ivan Fedorov, mayor of the city of Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, said Russians appeared to be heading south to Crimea.\n\nThose Russian fighters weren't the only ones to survive a Ukrainian attack. Check out this wild video below showing two Russian Su-25 Frogfoot attack jets narrowly missing disaster at the hands of Ukrainian air defense.\n\nBut not all Russian pilots were so fortunate. The Ukrainian Air Force claimed Tuesday it downed two Russian jets - a Su-24 Fencer and a Su-25 Frogfoot - in two hours.\n\nAs the war, now 202 days old, drags on and equipment losses mount for both sides, Russia and Ukraine continue to look elsewhere to restock their supplies.\n\nRussia, for instance, is asking its former Soviet Republic of Tajikistan to supply it with 220mm Uragun rockets and 203mm shells for its Pion self-propelled artillery systems, according to Ukrainian intelligence.\n\nUkrainian intelligence also reports that the \"successes of the Ukrainian Defense Forces in conducting a counteroffensive operation\" will \"unite European political forces. Especially in Germany. On September 14, the Federal Government of Germany will hear the report of German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock on her visit to Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Obviously, the issue of increasing military and military-technical assistance to Ukraine will be raised. After all, this will help to continue the successful counteroffensive of the Ukrainian Defense Forces and liberate the territories captured by the Russian Federation.\"\n\nBut that hope apparently did not immediately bear fruit. Germany's Rheinmetall defense contractor is restoring 16 of that nation's Marder infantry fighting vehicles for Ukraine at its own expense, but so far has been unable to get an export license from the German federal government to ship them off.\n\nDespite any travails, Ukraine officials, echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, are urging its populace to keep a stiff upper lip.\n\nApparently, potato pancakes, along with retaking so much territory, are a recipe for good morale.\n\nWe will continue to update this story until we state otherwise.",

                "cc_text": "Ukraines second-largest city of Kharkiv appeared to be without power Sunday night.\n\nKYIV, Ukraine Russia attacked power stations and other infrastructure Sunday, causing widespread outages across Ukraine as Kyivs forces pressed a swift counteroffensive that has driven Moscow's troops from swaths of territory it had occupied in the northeast.\n\nThe bombardment ignited a massive fire at a power station on Kharkiv's western outskirts and killed at least one person. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the \"deliberate and cynical missile strikes\" against civilian targets as acts of terrorism.\n\nUkraines second-largest city of Kharkiv appeared to be without power Sunday night. Cars drove through darkened streets, and the few pedestrians used flashlights or mobile phones to light their way.\n\nSeparately, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the Russia-occupied south completely shut down in a bid to prevent a radiation disaster as fighting raged nearby.\n\nKyiv's action in recent days to reclaim Russia-occupied areas in the Kharkiv region forced Moscow to withdraw its troops to prevent them from being surrounded, leaving behind significant numbers of weapons and munitions in a hasty flight as the war marked its 200th day on Sunday.\n\nUkraines military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyy, said its forces had recaptured about 3,000 square kilometers (1,160 square miles) since the counteroffensive began in early September. He said Ukrainian troops are only 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nOne battalion shared a video of Ukrainian forces in front of a municipal building in Hoptivka, a village just over a mile from the border and about 19 kilometers (12 miles) north of Kharkiv.\n\nKharkiv Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said Ukrainian troops have reclaimed control of more than 40 settlements in the region.\n\nIn Sunday nights missile attacks by Russia, the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions seemed to bear the brunt. Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Sumy had only partially lost power, Zelenskyy said.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov called the power outage \"revenge by the Russian aggressor for the successes of our army at the front, in particular, in the Kharkiv region.\"\n\nUkrainian officials said Russia hit Kharkiv TEC-5, the countrys second-biggest heat and power plant, and Zelenskyy posted video of the Kharkiv power plant on fire.\n\n\"Russian terrorists remain terrorists and attack critical infrastructure. No military facilities, only the goal of leaving people without light and heat,\" he tweeted,\n\nBut Zelenskyy remained defiant despite the attacks. Addressing Russia, he added: \"Do you still think you can intimidate, break us, force us to make concessions? ... Cold, hunger, darkness and thirst for us are not as scary and deadly as your `friendship and brotherhood. But history will put everything in place. And we will be with gas, lights, water and food and WITHOUT you!\"\n\nLater in the evening some power had been restored in some regions. None of the outages were believed to be related to the shutdown of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant.\n\nWhile most attention focused on the counteroffensive, Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europes largest, was reconnected to Ukraines electricity grid, allowing engineers to shut down its last operational reactor to safeguard it amid the fighting.\n\nThe plant, one of the 10 biggest atomic power stations in the world, has been occupied by Russian forces since the early days of the war. Ukraine and Russia have traded blame for shelling around it.\n\nSince a Sept. 5 fire caused by shelling knocked the plant off transmission lines, the reactor was powering crucial safety equipment in so-called \"island mode\" an unreliable regime that left the plant increasingly vulnerable to a potential nuclear accident.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog that has two experts at the site, welcomed the restoration of external power. But IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said he is \"gravely concerned about the situation at the plant, which remains in danger as long as any shelling continues.\"\n\nHe said talks have begun on establishing a safety and security zone around it.\n\nIn a call Sunday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron urged the withdrawal of Russian troops and weaponry from the plant in line with IAEA recommendations.\n\nThe pullback of Moscow's forces in recent days marked the biggest battlefield success for Ukrainian forces since they thwarted a Russian attempt to seize Kyiv near the start of the war. The Kharkiv campaign seemed to take Moscow by surprise; it had relocated many of its troops from the region to the south in expectation of a counteroffensive there.\n\nYuriy Kochevenko, of the 95th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, tweeted a video from what appeared to be central Izyum. The city was considered an important command and supply hub for Russias northern front.\n\n\"Everything around is destroyed, but we will restore everything. Izyum was, is, and will be Ukraine,\" Kochevenko said in his video, showing the empty central square and destroyed buildings.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian General Staff said Russian troops also had left several settlements in the Kherson region, in the southern part of the country, as Kyiv's forces pressed the counteroffensive. It did not identify the areas.\n\nBut an official with the Russian-backed administration in the city of Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, said on social media that the city north of the Crimean Peninsula was safe and asked everyone to stay calm.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday the withdrawal from Izyum and other areas was intended to strengthen Moscow's forces in the neighboring Donetsk region to the south. The explanation was similar to how Russia justified pulling back from Kyiv earlier this year.\n\nBut Igor Strelkov, who led Russia-backed forces when the separatist conflict in the Donbas erupted in 2014, mocked the Russian Defense Ministry's explanation of the retreat, suggesting that handing over Russia's own territory near the border was a \"contribution to a Ukrainian settlement.\"\n\nThe retreat angered Russian military bloggers and nationalist commentators, who bemoaned it as a major defeat and urged the Kremlin to step up its war efforts. Many criticized Russian authorities for continuing with fireworks and other lavish festivities in Moscow that marked a city holiday on Saturday despite the debacle in Ukraine.\n\nIn Moscow, Putin attended the opening of a huge Ferris wheel in a park on Saturday, and inaugurated a new transport link and a sports arena. The action underscored the Kremlin's narrative that the war it calls a \"special military operation\" was going according to plan without affecting Russians' everyday lives.\n\nPro-Kremlin political analyst Sergei Markov criticized the Moscow festivities as a grave mistake.\n\n\"The fireworks in Moscow on a tragic day of Russias military defeat will have extremely serious political consequences,\" Markov wrote on his messaging app channel. \"Authorities mustnt celebrate when people are mourning.\"\n\nIn a sign of a potential rift in the Russian leadership, Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed head of Chechnya, said the retreat resulted from blunders by the Russian brass.\n\n\"They have made mistakes and I think they will draw the necessary conclusions,\" Kadyrov said. \"If they dont make changes in the strategy of conducting the special military operation in the next day or two, I will be forced to contact the leadership of the Defense Ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the head of NATO cautioned Friday the war would likely go on for months, urging the West to keep supporting Ukraine through what could be a difficult winter.\n\nUkraines battlefield gains would help as the Biden administration seeks continued financial support of the war effort from Congress and Western allies, said Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland and now a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington.",

All times EDT.\n\n10:01 p.m.:\n\n8:17 p.m.: A cargo ship carrying 3,000 metric tons of corn from Ukraine under a U.N.-brokered export deal drifted aground in Turkey's Bosphorus strait on Thursday, halting shipping through Istanbul, according to the governor's office and a shipping firm.\n\nThe Istanbul governor's office said the 173-meter Lady Zehma was safely grounded and anchored after a rudder failure around 1800 GMT. No one was hurt and coast guards were attending, it said.\n\nEarlier this week the Joint Coordination Center, run by the United Nations, Ukraine, Russia and Turkey after a grains-export deal was reached, said the Lady Zehma was cleared to depart Ukraine's Chornomorsk port for Ravenna, Italy.\n\n7:42 p.m.: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned Moldova on Thursday that threatening the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transdniestria risked triggering military confrontation with Moscow.\n\nRussia has stationed peacekeeping troops in Transdniestria since the early 1990s, when an armed conflict saw pro-Russian separatists wrest most of the region from Moldovan control.\n\nThe government in Chisinau, stressing it was committed to peaceful dialog over the future of the region, said it would summon the acting Russian ambassador to make clear its position.\n\nRussia says its army is there to maintain peace and stability, but Moldova wants Moscow to withdraw its forces.\n\n6:40 p.m.: Two advisers to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have asked French oil major TotalEnergies to reject a $438.02 million dividend from one of its Russian holdings or to spend the money on Ukrainian reconstruction.\n\nIn a Sept. 1 letter, Zelenskyy advisers Oleg Ustenko and Mykhailo Podolyak asked CEO Patrick Pouyanne if TotalEnergies was planning to reject the dividend and - if not - called on the firm to establish a fund for Ukrainian war victims. The letter was seen by Reuters and first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTotalEnergies did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\n5:35 p.m.: The visit by U.N. experts to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will be successful if it leads to the demilitarization of the facility, the head of Ukraine's state nuclear company said on Thursday.\n\nEnergoatom chief Petro Kotin, speaking to Reuters at a Ukrainian-controlled checkpoint on the road to the plant, said Ukrainian authorities were working to turn the plant's fifth reactor back on after it shut down because of shelling early Thursday.\n\n4:46 p.m.: The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross called on Thursday for all fighting near the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia power plant to stop, warning that little could be done to respond in the event of a major accident there.\n\n\"In the event of a nuclear leak, it will be difficult if not impossible to provide humanitarian assistance ... and this is why fighting should stop,\" Robert Mardini told a news conference during a visit to Ukraine.\n\nMardini told Reuters that the Red Cross was not stockpiling or distributing iodine tablets to people near the plant to avoid sowing panic.\n\n\"We don't want to give a signal that this is inevitable,\" he said. \"This is totally self-inflicted risk that should be totally stopped.\"\n\n3:45 p.m.:\n\n2:45 p.m.: Russia is calling for a United Nations Security Council meeting next week to discuss the situation regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, VOAs U.N. Correspondent Margaret Besheer reported Thursday. Dmitry Polyanskiy, the First Deputy Permanent Representative of Russia to the U.N., asked that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi brief the meeting participants on September 6.\n\n2:30 p.m.: The Kremlin says Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be able to attend the funeral service of Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader who died earlier this week, because of his work schedule, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Thursday that while Gorbachev will not be honored with a full state funeral, the service will have an honor guard and some other elements usually given during such a ceremony.\n\nHe added that Putin stopped by the Central Clinical Hospital earlier in the day to bid farewell to the man credited with helping end the Cold War, whose body remains there after he passed away at the age of 91 on August 30 following a prolonged illness.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the presidents work schedule will not allow him to do that [attend the service] on September 3, which is why he decided to it today,\" Peskov said.\n\n2:15 p.m.:\n\n1:45 p.m.: One stood for freedom, openness, peace and closer ties with the outside world. The other is jailing critics, muzzling journalists, pushing his country deeper into isolation and waging Europes bloodiest conflict since World War II, The Associated Press reported Thursday.\n\nSuch are historys bookends between Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Unions last leader, and Vladimir Putin, Russias president.\n\nIn many ways, Gorbachev, who died Tuesday, unwittingly enabled Putin. The forces Gorbachev unleashed spun out of control, led to his downfall and the Soviet Unions collapse.\n\nSince coming to power in 1999, Putin has been taking a hard line that resulted in a near-complete reversal of Gorbachevs reforms.\n\n1:10 p.m.: Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, was shocked and bewildered by the Ukraine conflict in the months before he died and psychologically crushed in recent years by Moscow's worsening ties with Kyiv, his interpreter said on Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nPavel Palazhchenko, who worked with the late Soviet president for 37 years and was at his side at numerous U.S.-Soviet summits, spoke to Gorbachev a few weeks ago by phone and said he and others had been struck by how traumatized he was by events in Ukraine.\n\n\"It's not just the (special military) operation that started on February 24, but the entire evolution of relations between Russia and Ukraine over the past years that was really, really a big blow to him. It really crushed him emotionally and psychologically,\" Palazhchenko told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\"It was very obvious to us in our conversations with him that he was shocked and bewildered by what was happening (after Russian troops entered Ukraine in February) for all kinds of reasons. He believed not just in the closeness of the Russian and Ukrainian people, he believed that those two nations were intermingled.\"\n\nNow 73, he is well placed to know the late politician's state of mind in the period before he died, having seen him in recent months and been in touch with Gorbachev's daughter Irina. Gorbachev, who was 91 when he died on Tuesday from an unspecified illness, had family connections to Ukraine, said Palazhchenko.\n\n12:45 p.m.:\n\n12:05 p.m.: International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi has left the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom wrote on Telegram on Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nEnergoatom wrote that five IAEA representatives will remain on the plant's territory, likely until September 3.\n\n11:15 a.m.: As the war in Ukraine stretches into its seventh month, North Korea is hinting at its interest in sending construction workers to help rebuild Russian-occupied territories in the countrys east, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe idea is openly endorsed by senior Russian officials and diplomats, who foresee a cheap and hard-working workforce that could be thrown into the \"most arduous conditions,\" a term Russias ambassador to North Korea used in a recent interview.\n\nNorth Koreas ambassador to Moscow recently met with envoys from two Russia-backed separatist territories in the Donbas region of Ukraine and expressed optimism about cooperation in the \"field of labor migration,\" citing his countrys easing pandemic border controls.\n\nThe talks came after North Korea in July became the only nation aside from Russia and Syria to recognize the independence of the territories, Donetsk and Luhansk, further aligning with Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n10:25 a.m.:\n\n9:50 a.m.: Russia on Thursday launched weeklong war games involving forces from China and other nations in a show of growing defense cooperation between Moscow and Beijing, as they both face tensions with the United States, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe maneuvers are also intended to demonstrate that Moscow has sufficient military might for massive drills even as its troops are engaged in military action in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that the Vostok 2022 (East 2022) exercise will be held until Sept. 7 at seven firing ranges in Russias Far East and the Sea of Japan and involve more than 50,000 troops and over 5,000 weapons units, including 140 aircraft and 60 warships.\n\nRussian General Staff chief, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, will personally oversee the drills involving troops from several ex-Soviet nations, China, India, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Syria.\n\nThe Defense Ministry noted that as part of the maneuvers, the Russian and Chinese navies in the Sea of Japan will \"practice joint action to protect sea communications, areas of marine economic activity and support for ground troops in littoral areas.\"\n\n9:15 a.m.: A team of U.N. experts arrived at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia atomic plant complex on Thursday to assess the risk of a radiation disaster after being delayed several hours by shelling near the site, Reuters reported.\n\nA Reuters reporter saw the IAEA team arrive in a large convoy with a heavy presence of Russian soldiers nearby. A Ukrainian source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters the mission \"may turn out to be shorter than was planned.\"\n\nRussia and Ukraine accused each other of trying to sabotage the mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the plant in southern central Ukraine, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff.\n\nConditions at the nuclear plant, Europe's largest, have been unravelling for weeks, with Moscow and Kyiv regularly trading blame for shelling in the vicinity and fueling fears of a Chornobyl-style radiation disaster.\n\n8:00 a.m.: The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency reported on Twitter Thursday morning that its inspection team, led by Director General Rafael Grossi, had reached the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power facility, after many delays.\n\n7:40 a.m.: The IAEA's monitoring mission to the under-fire Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant may turn out to be \"shorter than planned,\" a Ukrainian source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Thursday.\n\n\"The mission may turn out to be shorter than was planned,\" the source said on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe IAEA convoy's progress to the plant was delayed on Thursday by fresh shelling on its territory, with Kyiv and Moscow accusing each other of being responsible.\n\n7:15 a.m.: Robert Mardini, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, has warned that fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant must be halted immediately before a \"massive incident\" causes a humanitarian catastrophe, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\n\"In the event of a nuclear leak, it will be difficult if not impossible to provide humanitarian assistance...and this is why fighting should stop,\" Mardini told a news conference on September 1 during a visit to Ukraine.\n\n\"It is therefore time to stop playing with fire and instead take concrete measures to protect this facility, and others like it, from military any operations.... The slightest miscalculation could trigger devastation that we will regret for decades,\" he added.\n\nExperts from the International Atomic Energy Agency were on their way to visit the plant early on September 1 despite ongoing shelling. The mission is set to assess physical damage to the plant, determine the functionality of safety and security systems, evaluate staff conditions and perform urgent safeguards activities.\n\n\"The scenario could be a massive incident, and...there is very little anyone can do to mitigate the dire consequences of this,\" Mardini said.\n\n6:40 a.m.: The Kremlin said on Thursday it was concerned about a possible \"provocation\" from Ukraine at the Russian-held Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant ahead of a visit by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Reuters reported.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have accused each other of trying to sabotage the mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the plant in southern Ukraine, which was delayed on Thursday due to shelling near the facility.\n\n\"We are concerned about a provocation from the Ukrainian side, given that barbaric and provocative shelling has not stopped,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. Peskov said Russia was ready to cooperate with the IAEA and was interested in seeing the IAEA mission arrive at the plant.\n\nA spokesperson for the IAEA said that its mission was waiting at a Ukrainian checkpoint after fresh shelling but remained determined to reach the facility later in the day.\n\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier on Thursday that Russia was doing everything to ensure that the plant, controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff, was operating safely.\n\n6:10 a.m.: The company that oversees Ukraines nuclear power plants said shelling by Russian forces triggered a shutdown at one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant, The Associated Press reported, underscoring the risks faced by a team of U.N. inspectors that was heading there Thursday to assess its safety.\n\nUkraines Enerhoatom said Russian mortar shelling led to the shutdown of one of its reactors by its emergency protection system. Shelling also damaged a backup power supply line used for in-house needs, and one of the plants reactors that wasnt operating was switched to diesel generators, the company said.\n\nA team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, led by its director Rafael Grossi, set off for the Russia-held nuclear power plant Europes largest despite the heavy shelling for which Ukraine and Russia trade blame.\n\n\"There has been increased military activity, including this morning until very recently,\" Grossi said, adding that after being briefed by the Ukrainian military he decided to get moving despite the inherent risks. \"But weighing the pros and cons and having come so far, we are not stopping.\"\n\nA spokesman for the IAEA later said that the mission has been delayed on the Ukrainian-controlled side of the frontline for some three hours, adding that Grossi \"has personally negotiated with Ukrainian military authorities to be able to proceed and he remains determined that this important mission reaches the ZNPP today.\"\n\n5:22 a.m.: The U.K. defense ministry, in its latest intelligence update, said Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations in southern Ukraine, supported by intensive long-range strikes against Russian command and logistics locations across the occupied zone.\n\n4:34 a.m.: The Russian economy shrank 0.4% in the first six months of 2022 compared with a year ago, but capital investment, one of the main economic growth drivers, rose 7.8%, data from the federal statistics service Rosstat showed on Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe export-dependent economy is plunging into recession, hit by sweeping Western sanctions for what Moscow calls \"a special military operation\" in Ukraine. But the depth of contraction has so far been not as big as initially thought.\n\nIn 2022, the economy will shrink by less than 3%, a top government official said this week in contrast to the earlier assumption from the economy ministry that had warned of a drop of more than 12%.\n\nRosstat data contradicts expectations of many economists who had predicted the Russian economy would collapse this year under the weight of unprecedented Western sanctions. But higher prices for its oil exports cushioning the impact.\n\n3:31 a.m.: Germany's chief of defense has warned that the West must not underestimate Moscow's military strength, saying Russia has the scope to open up a second front should it choose to do so.\n\n\"The bulk of the Russian land forces may be tied down in Ukraine at the moment but, even so, we should not underestimate the Russian land forces' potential to open a second theatre of war,\" General Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier of the Bundeswehr, told Reuters in an interview.\n\nBeyond the army, Russia also has a navy and air force at its disposal, he added.\n\n\"Most of the Russian navy has not yet been deployed in the war on Ukraine, and the Russian air force still has significant potential as well, which poses a threat to NATO too,\" Zorn said.\n\n2:37 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, issued its latest assessment of the Ukraine conflict, saying that Russian occupation authorities are imposing a curriculum on Ukrainian students aimed at eliminating the notion of Ukrainian national identity, explicitly in line with Russian President Vladimir Putins speeches and writings falsely claiming that Ukraine is part of Russia, and that the Ukrainian identity was an invention of the Soviet period.\n\nRussian forces, the assessment said, conducted a limited ground attack north of Kharkiv City and ground attacks south of Bakhmut and along the western outskirts of Donetsk City.\n\nUkrainian partisans, the assessment said, conducted an improvised explosive device (IED) attack against the headquarters of the \"Together with Russia\" political organization in Berdyansk, Zaporizhia Oblast, where occupation authorities were reportedly preparing for sham referenda.\n\n1:25 a.m.:\n\n12:02 a.m.: Belgium announced measures to tackle soaring energy prices, including cuts to public buildings' power consumption and a proposal to tax the excess profits of energy companies, Reuters reported.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said on Wednesday the heating in public buildings will be limited to 19 degrees Celsius and air conditioning use reduced, while lighting of offices and monuments will be switched off at 7 p.m. Talks will continue to decide on turning off lights on highways and in cities at certain hours.\n\nThe federal government also decided to extend a reduced 6% VAT rate for gas and electricity and a special energy rate for the poor until the end of the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIt also said it would present by the end of September a proposal to tax the excess profits of energy companies.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.",

Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed.\n\nThe Kremlin said Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, as gas prices surged and the pound and euro slumped. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlins spokesperson, blamed sanctions for Russias failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. \"It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.\"\n\nThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoan, has blamed Europes energy crisis on sanctions it imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine a line taken by the Kremlin itself. European nations were \"harvesting what they sowed\" by imposing economic restrictions on Russia, Erdoan added.\n\nThe backup power line at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the line itself was not damaged and that the backup line \"will be reconnected once the fire has been extinguished\".\n\nAn expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is set to release their findings from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report later on Tuesday. Four of the six UN mission members at the plant have left the site and the remaining two IAEA experts will stay on a permanent basis, the UN nuclear watchdog said.\n\nThe Kremlin has said \"with much certainty\" that Russia-UK relations will not improve under the leadership of Liz Truss. \"Judging by statements made by Madame Truss when she was still foreign minister one can say with much certainty that no changes for the better are expected,\" said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.\n\nUkraines forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said Kyivs troops had \"liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper\" and that Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper would be in an \"extremely difficult\" position within a month.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official said the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that \"the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions\".\n\nVladimir Putin attended large-scale military exercises on Tuesday involving China and several other Russia-friendly countries. Participating countries in the military drills included several of Russias neighbours, as well as Syria, India and key ally China.\n\nJailed Russian opposition politician and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalnys chief of staff has said worsening prison conditions were threatening his health. In a post on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, Navalny wrote last week via his lawyers that he had been sent to a punishment cell for a third time in August in revenge for his political activity.\n\nUkraines southern offensive has prompted Kherson occupiers to \"pause\" a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia. Russian state news agency Tass reported that the head of Khersons Russian-appointed authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said plans for a referendum on joining Russia had been \"paused\" because of the security situation.",

                "cc_text": "Following is the transcript of UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres press conference, in New York today:\n\nSecretary-General: Ladies and gentlemen of the media, thank you very much for your presence, and welcome. I have just returned from Pakistan, where I looked through a window into the future. A future of permanent and ubiquitous climate chaos on an unimaginable scale: devastating loss of life; enormous human suffering; and massive damage to infrastructure and livelihoods.\n\nIt is simply heartbreaking. No picture can convey the scope of this catastrophe. The flooded area is three times the size of my entire country, Portugal. What is happening in Pakistan demonstrates the sheer inadequacy of the global response to the climate crisis, and the betrayal and injustice at the heart of it. Whether it is Pakistan, the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, small islands or least developed countries, the worlds most vulnerable who did nothing to cause this crisis are paying a horrific price for decades of intransigence by big emitters.\n\nG20 [Group of 20] countries are responsible for 80 per cent of emissions. They are also suffering the impact of record droughts, fires and floods, but climate action seems to be flatlining. If one third of G20 countries was under water today, as it could be tomorrow, perhaps they would find it easier to agree on drastic cuts to emissions. All countries with the G20 leading the way must boost their national emissions reduction [targets] and must limit the worlds temperature rise to 1.5C.\n\nPakistan and other climate hotspots need flood-resilient infrastructure now. And those most responsible for emissions must step up with the funds for adaptation. At least half of all climate finance and climate resilience should go to adaptation and climate resilience, to protect people and economies. Unless action is taken now, unless funds are disbursed now, these tragedies will simply multiply, with devastating consequences for years to come, including instability and mass migration around the world.\n\nSo, my message to world leaders gathering here is clear: Lower the temperature now. Dont flood the world today; dont drown it tomorrow.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the General Assembly is meeting at a time of great peril. Geostrategic divides are the widest they have been since at least the cold war. They are paralysing the global response to the dramatic challenges we face. Our world is blighted by war, battered by climate chaos, scarred by hate, and shamed by poverty, hunger and inequality. Conflicts and unrest continue to rage.\n\nThe war in Ukraine is devastating a country and dragging down the global economy. Despite the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the agreement that we are doing everything to make it happen in reality to get Russian food and fertilizers to global markets, there is a real risk of multiple famines this year.\n\nGlobal hunger began to rise before the pandemic and has never recovered. The cost-of-living crisis is hitting the poorest people and communities hardest, with dramatic effects. The rights of women and girls are going into reverse. Most developing countries have no fiscal space, and no access to the financial resources needed to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and protect their people from the devastating impact of climate change.\n\nThe solidarity envisioned in the United Nations Charter is being devoured by the acids of nationalism and self-interest. By a shocking disregard for the poorest and most vulnerable in our world. By politicians who play to peoples worst instincts for partisan gain. By prejudice, discrimination, misinformation and hate speech that pit people against one another. By a global financial system that penalizes those with the least. By fossil fuel corporations killing the planet to rake in the most.\n\nMy speech to the General Assembly will address these issues with concrete recommendations and a call to action. As fractures deepen and trust evaporates, we need to come together around solutions. Solutions like those that will be showcased at the Transforming Education Summit. People need to see results in their everyday lives, or they will lose faith in their governments and institutions, and they will lose hope in the future.\n\nThis years general debate must be about providing hope and overcoming the divisions that are dramatically impacting the world. That hope can indeed only come through the dialogue and debate that are the beating heart of the United Nations and that must prevail next week against all divisions. Thank you.\n\n** Questions and Answers\n\nSpokesman: Thank you very much. Before we get to our questions, just we have our very helpful interpreters, Spanish and French, in case the SecretaryGeneral answers in Spanish or English. I would ask you please to\n\nSecretary-General: Spanish or French.\n\nSpokesman: Spanish or French. Yes, sometimes you do answer in English. Sorry, sir. Maybe I need the interpreter. If I could also ask you, yes, take off your mask when you ask a question, and please limit yourself to one question so we can get\n\nQuestion: Can we ask in Portuguese?\n\nSpokesman: Sorry?\n\nQuestion: Can we ask in Portuguese?\n\nSpokesman: You can try in Portuguese, as well. Go ahead, Valeria, please.\n\nQuestion: Thank you. Thank you, SecretaryGeneral, for this press conference. It's always great to see you here. So, my question is on Ukraine. In light of the inspection of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] and the state of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, can it guarantee the supply of energy, and most of all, the heating to the region for which it must guarantee? And are you aware of the possibility of maintaining heating and all other utilities for the Ukraine people need from Zaporizhzhia to Donbas to Kharkiv since the winter is almost approaching? Thank you.\n\nSecretary-General: According to the information I have, electricity is being provided to the reactors for guaranteeing the cooling of those reactors, and other areas that also need the electricity supply are having it. And we hope that it will be able to maintain it, both with generators and through the grid. The IAEA remains on the site, and the information we have are also that, until now, there was no radiation measured that is worrying. I believe that we have been now three days without bombing. I hope that these kinds of attacks will cease, and I hope that the security of the nuclear power plant will be maintained entirely at all costs and fully respected by the parties.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. Edie Lederer.\n\nQuestion: Thank you very much, Mr. SecretaryGeneral, a quick followup on what you just said about Zaporizhzhia. We heard that there are some talks going on between the IAEA chief, Mr. [Rafael Mariano] Grossi, and the Ukrainians and the Russians. Is that what you believe has led to the end of shelling for the past three days? Are these talks something the UN is encouraging, involved in, in other ways?\n\nSecretary-General: Those talks are taking place, and I hope they will contribute to quiet things down. I cannot establish a cause-and-effect, but I believe that the IAEA presence is a very important deterrent and that their contacts are a very important deterrent in relation to any kind of attack against the power plant.\n\nQuestion: What I was going to ask you about was Ukraine also, whether the offensive by, the counteroffensive by the Ukrainian Government, which has led to the recapture of a significant amount of territory, makes you believe that there might be some kind of a possibility for ending the war, or do you think that this is basically going to encourage the Ukrainians to go and recapture the rest of its territory?\n\nSecretary-General: Well, I don't make comments about what each of the parties might think. I have the feeling that we are still far away from peace. I believe that peace is essential, peace in line with the UN Charter and international law, but I would be lying if I would say that it will happen soon.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. Michelle Nichols, Reuters.\n\nQuestion: Sorry, SecretaryGeneral, I'm not used to wearing a mask again. Michelle Nichols from Reuters. Thank you for the briefing. Next week, obviously, you're going to have world leaders here in New York, but President [Vladimir V.] Putin will not be here. When was the last time you spoke to him? Do you plan to speak with him again before the General Assembly? And are your conversations with him focussed on these sort of mini-deals to do with the nuclear plant, the ammonia deal that was discussed or we spoke about yesterday with Rebeca Grynspan? What's your message to him when you speak to him about a broader end to the war?\n\nSecretary-General: Well, the last time I spoke with President Putin was this morning. That is the reason why I came late to the press conference. And we had the opportunity to discuss the Black Sea Grain Initiative and its extension and expansion, possible expansion. There are, as you know, talks in relation to the possibility of ammonia, Russian ammonia exports through the Black Sea, through the, in line with the methodology that is run by the JCC, the Joint Coordination Committee. We have discussed the obstacles that still exist in relation to the exports of Russian food and fertilizers, and I have to say that we have now a dramatic situation in the world in fertilizers. We are risking to have a fertilizer market crunch. We have news from different parts of the world where the areas cultivated are much smaller than in the previous cycle, which means that we risk to have in [2023] a real lack of food.\n\nSo, to remove the obstacles that still exist in relation to the export of Russian fertilizers is absolutely essential at the present moment. On the other hand, we discussed the questions of prisoners of war. We discussed the factfinding mission. The fact-finding mission will be able to go to the area in which the attack that victimised so many prisoners of war took place. It will be able to go, there will be no obstacle from the Russian side for it to go through whatever way we choose, and that is a very important aspect. On the other hand, we discussed prisoners of war in general. We discussed Zaporizhzhia, and we discussed all the other aspects that are relevant in the present situation. And I usually do not say what I say in phone calls. My positions are known.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. Grigory, TASS News Agency.\n\nQuestion: Thank you very much. SecretaryGeneral, I just want to follow up on grain deal. Are you going to continue to discuss the grain, the possible extension of a grain deal with Russian side due to the facts that various, almost no expert of Russian food and fertilisers yet, and so, are you going to discuss that during the highlevel week? Thank you.\n\nSecretary-General: Of course. First of all, there are some exports of Russian food and fertilizers, but much lower than what is desirable and to what will be needed. And of course, this is an area that I've been referring and I will refer clearly during the General Debate.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. Natalya, ICTV, Ukraine.\n\nQuestion: Hello, Mr. [Secretary-General]. I'm Natalya Lutsenko from\n\nSpokesman: Sorry.\n\nQuestion: Here. I'm here. Hi. I'm Natalya Lutsenko from ICTV station Ukraine. My question is about the prisoners of war that you have discussed. Actually, we know that it's known that Russia is prevents access to Ukrainian prisoners of war, so will be are you going to discuss that with the Russian delegation here that is it possible to go to them for Ukrainian side? And is it possible to press the country with a veto in question of prisoners?\n\nSecretary-General: I didn't understand.\n\nQuestion: Is it possible to press to Russia with a veto in question of prisoners, to press them?\n\nSecretary-General: I mean, these are areas related to what Member States might decide in relation to resolutions that they present. What I can tell you is that I had the chance to discuss it today. I believe that there are negotiations still taking place, and I strongly hope that the problem of prisoners of war will be entirely solved, and I strongly hope that all prisoners of war from both sides will be exchanged.\n\nSpokesman: Pam Falk, CBS News.\n\nQuestion: Thank you, Steph. Thank you, SecretaryGeneral. I'm hearing music. It's Pamela Falk from CBS News. You personally helped broker the Ukraine grain deal. You spoke with President Putin. You spoke with President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. You spoke with President [Recep Tayyip] Erdoan. And that helped, is helping alleviate world hunger. Do you see this as any kind of a building block or a prototype for a peace deal? And if not, what are the impediments for you in your capacity to try to broker a deal for peace? Thank you.\n\nSecretary-General: Well, obviously, anything that can help rebuild confidence is useful, but it would be naive to think that we are close to the possibility of a peace deal. My good offices are ready, but I have no illusions that, at the present moment, the chances of a peace deal are minimal, at the present moment. So, obviously, I go on with my contacts with both sides and hope that, one day, it will be possible to move into a higher level of discussion. Now we are discussing the exports of ammonia. Now we are discussing aspects related to prisoners of war or to the fact-finding mission or to Zaporizhzhia. One day, I hope it will be possible to discuss peace.\n\nSpokesman: Iftikhar Ali, Associated Press of Pakistan. Your microphone, please.\n\nQuestion: Thank you very much, Steph. Mr. SecretaryGeneral, at the very top of your opening statement, which was very passionate, indeed, you referred to the solidarity visit to Pakistan, which you know was deeply appreciated, and especially by the victims. But, sir, since your visit, the situation has further deteriorated because of more rains in some of the affected areas. This has worsened an already bad situation. Sir, you have listed some of the steps that will to fight the climate change, but Pakistanis need immediate as you have already said, you see. So, what steps, specific steps you will take in order to translate your call for support to Pakistan into tangible action?\n\nSecretary-General: Well, first of all, we are strongly appealing to all that can help Pakistan to mobilise all their resources. There are some countries that have provided support. The UN is fully mobilised to support Pakistan, but Pakistan needs a massive inflow of financial resources, and my appeal to international financial institutions and my appeal to countries that have the financial capacity is not to lose one moment in providing Pakistan with the financial resources that are necessary for the gigantic tasks that are in front of us, for still avoiding the worst and, at the same time, for relief, recovery and reconstruction at the scale that, as I said, is unimaginable, and I have never seen anything similar, anywhere in the world.\n\nSpokesman: Ibtisam Azem.\n\nQuestion: Thank you. My name is Ibtisam Azem from AlAraby alJadeed newspaper. I just, at the beginning, I want to follow up quickly on the issue of your phone call with President Putin today. Did you bring also up the issue of a ceasefire or coming the issue of ceasefire and coming to the negotiation table? And my question is actually on Libya. Finally, the Security Council agreed to your appointment of Mr. Abdoulaye Bathily as your Special Representative in Libya. So, what is the biggest challenge you believe he's facing there? And as his boss, what are you going to do to support his mission so that it doesn't it's not doomed to fail as the missions of his predecessors? Are you going to speak to powerful countries, especially when it comes to their weapon delivery, mercenaries, et cetera? Thank you. And\n\nSecretary-General: As I said, I think a ceasefire is not in sight. In relation to Libya, it's difficult to know what is the biggest challenge that requires action. We must preserve, at all costs, peace, and that means preserve peace between east and west, but that also means preserve peace in relation to the recent confrontations that happened in Tripoli with militias supporting either Mr. [Abdul Hamid] Dbeibah or Mr. [Fathi] Bashagha. So, we need, I mean, we need hostilities not to happen. That is fundamental. Second, we need to come to, quickly, an agreement, namely between the House of Representatives and the High Council to allow for the changes that are necessary, legal changes that are necessary, for elections to take place. And this is absolutely essential because there is a question of legitimacy that now becomes extremely difficult to overcome. And then the third thing is to make sure that all external actors in the context are able to fully support a process of reconciliation and the process of political developments leading to elections and to a legitimate government that everybody accepts.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. Kris, CBC.\n\nQuestion: Kris Reyes with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. If I could just ask you a bigpicture question. Earlier this year, President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy, in his address to Congress, said: \"The war of the past have prompted our predecessors to create institutions that should protect us from war, but they, unfortunately, don't work. We see it. You see it. We need new ones.\" And I'm wondering, as we head into next week's highlevel debates, as we're seven months into this war in Ukraine, can you reflect on how effective you and the UN have been in upholding this institution's core principles and what lessons you've learned to ensure that the influence and the effectiveness of the UN remains relevant and effective, not just in conflicts in Ukraine, but the crisis that you've mentioned climate, food insecurity and things like that? Thank you.\n\nSecretary-General: Well, that's exactly the question. People tend to see Ukraine, to see the UN, looking at the Security Council. The UN goes far beyond the Security Council. And there was an important change in this session, or in the last session in the relations between the Security Council and the General Assembly. Now each veto issued in the Security Council will require a meeting of the General Assembly where the veto needs to be explained and discussed. And I think this has changed, in an important way, the balance between the two bodies. And I believe the General Assembly has been gaining credibility in the international community, which, of course, does not fully compensate for the difficulties of the Security Council. But the UN is, by far, the largest purveyor of humanitarian aid in the world. UN agencies are everywhere where there is conflict, where there are natural disasters, independently of the dangers.\n\nThe UN has peacekeeping forces avoiding the worst in several parts of the world. The UN has been very active in relation to climate change. I believe that probably the strongest voice in relation to climate change has been the voice of the UN. The UN has been very active, pushing for reforms of the international financial system and pushing for the need to effectively support developing countries in relation to the dramatic situation that they face at the present moment, the perfect storm that they face at the present moment. The UN has been very active in several conflict situations, mediating. Look at the pause that is taking place in Yemen.\n\nAnd in Ukraine, the UN has been very active in trying to find concrete solutions to concrete problems in which mediation is possible, recognizing that to solve the problem in its entirety is not possible at the present moment. So, if I believe there is a moment in which the UN is more needed than ever and if I believe that, if I believe that there is a moment, that it is this moment, and I think it is this moment, also, a moment in which you see the UN present everywhere. Of course, the UN cannot be limited to the fact that the group of Member States in the Security Council are unable to come to an agreement in solving the worst crisis that we face, namely, the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nSpokesman: Benno, German Press Agency.\n\nQuestion: Thank you, SecretaryGeneral, for the briefing. Benno Schwinghammer from the German Press Agency. I have one followup to the grain deal and one actual question about Libya. So, it was one week ago, roughly, that Vladimir Putin threatened to let the grain deal collapse. Now you talked with him this morning. Did he threaten again to close down the Black Sea corridor?\n\nSecretary-General: No, I believe that there is a very important dialogue between the UN and the Russian Federation, between the UN and Ukraine. And we are looking, not only at maintaining the grain deal, but expanding it, namely, in relation to, just to give an example, the possibility of having ammonia exports through the same channel from the Russian Federation, and the possibility of an extension in time of the grain deal. All this has been discussed, and I am hopeful that we will be able to maintain a very important contribution to the dramatic situation of food security in the world and, as I mentioned, that if we are able and we are totally committed to it to remove the obstacles that still exist in relation to the Russian exports of fertilizers, that we will be able to normalise the fertilizer market and allow for the cultivation for next year to take place at the usual levels.\n\nQuestion: Now my question about Libya. Where the UN's track record is quite good in terms of Ukraine, there are other conflicts which kind of, where progress kind of slipped out of your hands, for example, Libya. How important is it now to revive the Berlin process? If you talk with Chancellor [Olaf] Scholz, the German Chancellor Scholz, next week, will you talk with him about gathering people again and conduct a new conference?\n\nSecretary-General: [Inaudible] important and the Germany Minister for Foreign Affairs already indicated that Germany would be thinking about that possibility, and I strongly encourage that. I do believe that the Berlin process was the most useful international instrument that we had to avoid the worst. Unfortunately, it was not possible to reach a full solution, but it was possible to avoid the worst.\n\nSpokesman: Amelie, Agence FrancePresse.\n\nQuestion: I'm Amelie Bottollier-Depois from AFP news agency. You talked several times about the Black Sea Grain Initiative, who helped, I mean which helped ease the pressure on the food market. But, with winter coming, there's an energy crisis also looming for this winter in the next few months in many countries in the world. So, what could the UN, what could you do in this front? Thank you.\n\nSecretary-General: It is much more difficult to address the energy questions than to address the food security questions. In the energy questions, we have a combination of high interests Member States' interests, companies' interests that make progress much more difficult because those interests are largely contradictory. And I have to say that I find it absolutely unacceptable to see that, when people are suffering so much in different parts of the world and, namely, because of the high costs of energy and high costs of fuel, to see fossil fuel companies having the largest profits ever or at least in the recent past, and I strongly encourage Governments to tax those exceptional profits.\n\nSpokesman: Margaret Besheer, Voice of America.\n\nQuestion: Thank you, SecretaryGeneral. SecretaryGeneral, next week, the Foreign Ministers of both Russia and Ukraine are going to be here. Are you trying to organize any kind of a meeting between them, using your good offices, either a direct meeting or some sort of an indirect shuttle diplomacy between rooms or something, to try and work out some of these important issues that you mentioned, like the POWs [prisoners of war] in Zaporizhzhia?\n\nSecretary-General: If I announce today that I'm trying to bring them together, that is the best, best way to make sure that they will not meet.\n\nSpokesman: Raghida Dergham in the back.\n\nQuestion: SecretaryGeneral, Raghida Dergham, columnist with The National and Annahar Al Arabi. The IAEA seems to be at the very centre of the problem for the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] and the deal with Iran. You know that Tehran in position which is calling the positions of the IAEA being politically driven, so they say, and it seems to be a dealbreaker. What is it that you'd like to say to the Iranian leadership about their position regarding restricting the IAEA and demanding that its scope is, its limited scope of work is limited in Tehran? What is it directly that you would like to say to the Iranian leadership on this matter and on how to get out of this impasse?\n\nSecretary-General: Well, I think the IAEA is a very important pillar, and I believe that its independence that exists and must be preserved is essential. The IAEA cannot be the instrument of parties against other parties. And I do believe the IAEA is doing its role based on the technical aspects in which the IAEA is supposed to have the knowledge and the capacity to do. My appeal to the Government of Iran or to any other Government in the same situation is to establish a serious dialogue with the IAEA creating the conditions for an effective cooperation that is needed for the credibility of any agreement.\n\nQuestion: [Inaudible]?\n\nSecretary-General: Sorry?\n\nQuestion: Do you feel now that this potential deal between Iran and the 5+1 is doomed because of that position on the IAEA, or do you think there is a way to facilitate coming out of this?\n\nSecretary-General: I do not think that is the most difficult question that is on the table. I think there are other difficult questions on the table, and my appeal to all parties is to make sure that they are all solved.\n\nSpokesman: Kristen Saloomey, Al Jazeera.\n\nQuestion: Thank you, SecretaryGeneral. Kristen Saloomey from Al Jazeera. You had some strong words for G20 leaders in your opening remarks. Many of them will be at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II next week. I'm wondering if you could talk about your decision not to attend the funeral and how you think that might impact the global focus on this important event and all the important issues you're trying to highlight next week.\n\nSpokesman: I did not decide not to attend the funeral. I decided to stay in New York to open the Education Summit that is convened by me and in which many people that do not go to the funeral will be present. So, it is my duty as SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations to be here when we have a summit convened by me. Probably some of the personalities that were supposed to be in that Summit will not be able to come, but others will be coming, and I'm convinced that the Education Summit will be successful. And the next day is the opening of the general debate, and obviously, it would be inconceivable that the SecretaryGeneral would not be opening the opening of the general debate. So, I did not take a decision not to go to the funeral. I took a decision to just exercise my duties, as I believe all Member States would consider necessary.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. Yes, sir, BBC.\n\nCorrespondent: Thank you, Mr. Secretary\n\nSecretary-General: It's not working.\n\nSpokesman: Yep. Hold on. There we go.\n\nQuestion: Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for doing this. Bahman Kalbasi, BBC News. You talked about JCPOA briefly. Do you mind expanding a little bit on that, whether you do you think you may have any sway with the Iranian leaders? Mr. [Seyyed Ebrahim] Raisi will be attending for the first time. And also, on human rights, this President was personally a member of committee in the 1980s that ordered mass executions of political prisoners. The Special Rapporteur extensively talks about worsening situation of human rights in Iran against activists, political opponents. What is your message to Mr. Raisi, if you see him, both on JCPOA and on this dismal human rights record?\n\nSecretary-General: I do believe that that meeting will take place, and it is obvious that those two issues will be in the agenda.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. Yes, please. Go ahead. Marta, go ahead, please. No, Lusa. Sorry. Yeah.\n\nQuestion: If I have permission to make the question in Portuguese? O senhor secretrio-geral fez um discurso, um discurso forte contra os pases ricos. Mas qual a sua mensagem para os pases africanos que constantemente sofrem com as alteraes climticas e agora tambm com a guerra na Ucrnia. Qual a mensagem para esses pases que, ano aps ano, se sentam aqui na Assembleia Geral, e vm os problemas constantemente a acontecer. A segunda pergunta : o novo Presidente da Assembleia Geral disse, na segunda-feira, que apoiar, trabalhar ativamente para uma reforma do Conselho de Segurana, e eu queria saber se o senhor secretrio-geral ir apoiar este trabalho. Obrigada.\n\n[In English: The Secretary General made a speech, a strong speech against rich countries. But, what is his message to African countries that are constantly suffering from climate change and now also from the war in Ukraine. What is the message for these countries that year after year sit here in the General Assembly, and see problems constantly occurring. The second question is: the new President of the General Assembly said on Monday that he will support, actively work towards a reform of the Security Council, and I was wondering if the Secretary-General will support this work. Thanks.]\n\nSecretary-General: Em primeiro lugar, em relao ao Conselho de Segurana, h uma Comisso de Estados-membros que se debrua sobre este tema, e naturalmente, esta Comisso ter todo o meio apoio, embora eu no tenha uma direta responsabilidade a esse nvel. Eu no falei contra ningum. Eu falei a favor dos pases em desenvolvimento e, nomeadamente, os pases africanos. Os pases africanos esto, e muitos pases em desenvolvimento, a maioria deles no mundo, est, como eu dizia h pouco, face a uma tempestade perfeita. No sei como que em portugus se traduz o \"perfect storm\", mas eu estou a traduzir a letra. Muitos deles no tiveram vacinas a tempo, os fundos que na Europa e nos Estados Unidos foi possvel mobilizar imprimindo dinheiro, esses pases no podem imprimir dinheiro seno as suas moedas imediatamente se desvalorizam de forma inaceitvel. No houve alvio da dvida, a no ser uma pequena suspenso em relao aos pases menos desenvolvidos, mas alvio da dvida no existiu. No houve acesso com financiamentos beneficiados, quer subsdios, quer com taxas de juros mais baixas para pases em desenvolvimento com rendimento mdio que enfrentam gravssimos problemas, vejam-se as pequenas ilhas, que tinham no turismo a sua receita fundamental e no tiveram receitas durante dois anos e tm o impacto das alteraes climticas e tm o impacto dos altos preos de energia, que so inteiramente dependentes, e da alimentao. Estes pases sofreram agora as consequncias da guerra na Ucrnia e a verdade que isso faz com que a situao seja uma situao muitas vezes desesperada, porque no h espao fiscal para responder s necessidades dos pases pobres. Vemos a pobreza e a fome a aumentarem de forma dramtica. E por isso que ns temos permanentemente insistido na adoo de imediatas medidas para dar liquidez a essas economias e para aliviar a dvida desses pases e, ao mesmo tempo, temos insistido na necessidade de uma reforma do sistema financeiro global, porque o atual sistema financeiro foi um sistema definido pelos ricos a favor dos ricos e no serve de maneira nenhuma os interesses dos pases em desenvolvimento, nomeadamente, os pases africanos.\n\n[In English: First of all, in relation to the Security Council, a commission of Member States is looking at this issue, and naturally, this commission will have all my support, although I don't have direct responsibility at that level. I didn't speak against anyone. I spoke in favor of developing countries, namely African countries. African countries are, and many developing countries, most of them in the world, are, as I was saying earlier, facing a perfect storm. I don't know how the \"perfect storm\" is translated in Portuguese, but I'm translating it literally. Many of them did not have vaccines in time, the funds that in Europe and the United States could be mobilized by printing money, these countries cannot print money otherwise their currencies will immediately devalue in an unacceptable way. There was no debt relief, other than a small suspension in relation to the least developed countries, but at the level of debt there was none. There was no excess with benefit financing, either through subsidies or with lower interest rates for developing countries with average income that face very serious problems, such as the small islands, which had their fundamental income from tourism and had no income for two years and they have the impact of climate change, and they have the impact of high energy prices, which they are entirely dependent, and food. These countries suffered from the consequences of the war in Ukraine and the truth is that this makes the situation often hopeless, because there is no fiscal space to respond to the needs of poor countries. We see poverty and hunger increase dramatically. And that is why we have permanently insisted on the adoption of immediate measures to provide liquidity to these economies and to alleviate the debt of these countries, and at the same time, we have insisted on the need for a reform of the global financial system, because the current financial system, it was a system defined by the rich in favor of the rich and in no way serves the interests of developing countries, namely African countries.]\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. We will transcribe that into English for the transcript. Yes, please. Go ahead.\n\nQuestion: Hi. Caroline, Feature Story News. SecretaryGeneral, you mentioned the real risk of multiple famines this year. If the grain shipments are not sufficient, if the ammonia doesn't help fertilizers soon enough, what else can and should be done? And how can you convince world leaders to help with that?\n\nSecretary-General: Well, first of all, we need to mobilize all resources. In 2022, we have no lack of food we have a problem of distribution. So, what we have is to guarantee that there are effective mechanisms that allow developing countries with risk of famine to be able to have access to the food that is available, and this is either through forms of direct assistance. The World Food Programme (WFP), as you know, is very active. We had two ships that left the Black Sea, one to Yemen and one to the Horn of Africa. A third is now being loaded to go to Djibouti, and the fourth will be arriving to go to Afghanistan. So, we need to boost assistance, food assistance, to those more vulnerable situations. And we need to create the conditions for these countries to have resources to be able to have access to the food markets. On the other hand, if, in 2022, we have not a problem of food, we have a problem of distribution, if we don't normalize the fertilizer market, we will have a problem of food in 2023. And indeed, we have news from West Africa and other parts of the world that farmers are cultivating less than in the previous year. And that is the reason why we absolutely need to normalise the fertilizer market, and that is the reason why I strongly appeal to remove all obstacles to the exports of Russian fertilisers that are not I repeat that are not subject to sanctions.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. Mr. Inaba, Kyodo.\n\nQuestion: Hi, my name is Toshiyuki Inaba from Kyodo News. Thank you, SecretaryGeneral. I have a followup question on Ukraine. It seems there is some possibility, in the coming weeks or coming month, that Ukraine will be in counteroffensive and while Russia will be solely defensive. In that situation, would you still call for the immediate ceasefire? What is your vision? What is your feasible plan to end this war? Thank you.\n\nSecretary-General: Well, we cannot appeal to ceasefires based on who's winning the war, I mean, because if you appeal to ceasefires when one is winning and the you don't appeal to ceasefire when the other is winning. Then, I mean, things do not make any sense. What we have been saying since the beginning is that what we need is peace, and peace and I always repeat in line with UN Charter and in line with international law. I do not believe the conditions now are met for that to be possible. And so, we will go on working to progressively, hopefully, create the trust that will build the capacity for those conditions to exist. And in between, we try to mediate all aspects in which we can be useful, and we can limit suffering and we can limit the consequences of the war in Ukraine in the world. And so many developing countries are suffering so much that we really need to pursue this objective very strongly. But, I would not be telling the truth to you if I would create illusions that we are going to obtain a ceasefire tomorrow because there has been a change in the way the military operations are taking place.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. We're going to go online. Ephrem, Arab News.\n\nQuestion: Thank you so much, Stphane. Mr. SecretaryGeneral, how do you see the role of the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE [United Arab Emirates], in tackling the current global crises from food insecurity to energy to climate, as well as the more regional crises of the Middle East from Syria, Yemen, Libya and Palestine? And how can, in what ways do you see the role can be enhanced? Thank you very much.\n\nSecretary-General: Well, first of all, I hope the GCC countries that have a huge capacity of production will contribute to minimise the energy crisis in the world, and I'm sure that they will be quite active in relation to the promotion of peace solutions in the neighbourhood, be it in Syria, be it in Libya or in Yemen or in any other country close to them. I think that the people of Syria, the people of Libya and the people of Yemen have already suffered too much, and my appeal is for everybody to come together to solve those problems. On the other hand, I hope that the dialogue that started between Saudi Arabia and Iran and other forms of dialogue in the region will produce results and will allow to a reduction of the tension in the Gulf.\n\nQuestion: [Inaudible?]\n\nSecretary-General: This is a central question for me. I mean, what's happening to girls, not being able to attend the school, what's happened to women, not being able to work, and all forms of, I mean, violation of their rights, is absolutely shameful and this is for me the most important concern in relation to the situation in Afghanistan.",

                "cc_text": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) Russia resumed shelling in the vicinity of Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a local official said Wednesday, a day after the U.N. atomic watchdog agency pressed for the warring sides to carve out a safe zone there to protect against a possible catastrophe.\n\nWATCH: IAEA calls for demilitarized zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine\n\nThe city of Nikopol, located on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Europes largest nuclear power plant, was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery, regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said.\n\nThe reports of nearby shelling, which couldnt be independently verified, have caused international alarm. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, warned the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that \"something very, very catastrophic could take place\" at Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"There are fires, blackouts and other things at the (plant) that force us to prepare the local population for the consequences of the nuclear danger,\" Reznichenko said.\n\nThe potential peril led the U.N. atomic watchdog agency to urge Russia and Ukraine to establish a \"nuclear safety and security protection zone\" around the plant.\n\nThere are fears the fighting could trigger a catastrophe on the scale of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. The plant was built during the Soviet era and is one of the 10 biggest in the world.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kiev officials would immediately commit to the idea of a safety zone, saying more details of the proposal were needed.\n\nThe plant is currently generating electricity only to power its safety systems, a senior Ukrainian official said.\n\nAny further disruption could force the plant to use a back-up diesel generator, but that would entail bringing four diesel transport trucks a day through the fighting, said Oleh Korikov, acting Chief State Inspector for the Nuclear and Radiation Safety of Ukraine.\n\n\"We could potentially be in a situation where we run out of diesel,\" he said. \"And this can lead to an accident with damage to the active zone of the reactors, and, accordingly, the release of radioactive products into the environment.\"\n\nAuthorities could consider shutting down the plant, he said, without offering details about how that would work.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin defied pressure to halt the war, saying Wednesday that Moscow will forge ahead with its military offensive in Ukraine until it achieves its goals. He also mocked Western attempts to stop Russia with sanctions.\n\nWATCH: Swedens idyllic holiday island of Gotland militarizes in face of Russian threats\n\nThe eastern city of Sloviansk came under Russian fire on Wednesday morning, damaging a school and another building, according to the head of the city administration Vadym Lyakh.\n\nFirefighters in the city dug deep into the still-smoldering rubble of an apartment building and removed at least one body bag.\n\nChunks of bricks, masonry and concrete lay among the torn branches of nearby trees, mixed with broken glass and roof tiles. Metal doors, buckled by the force of the blast, hung off their hinges.\n\nThe strike came at around 4 a.m., said local resident Raisa Smelkova, 75, who lives in another part of the building. She and her husband were unhurt.\n\nSmelkova and her husband lived through the previous war in Ukraine in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea region. But this time, she said, things are much worse.\n\n\"What is happening now is not just scary, its gruesome,\" she said. \"There is more destruction. Everything is worse. Just everything.\"\n\nThree civilians were killed in Russian shelling in the Donetsk region, the Ukrainian presidential office said. Kharkiv city was hit by rockets twice during the night.\n\nBut Ukrainian forces have taken control of an unspecified number of towns in the Kherson region, according to Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for the southern military command. She said details would come later from the military leadership.\n\nThe U.K. defense ministry said there had been heavy fighting on three fronts: in the north, near Kharkiv; in the east in the Donbas; and in the south in Kherson Oblast.\n\nAmid a Ukrainian counterattack in the east, \"multiple concurrent threats spread across 500 kilometers (310 miles) will test Russias ability to coordinate operational design and reallocate resources across multiple groupings of forces,\" the ministry said Wednesday.\n\nThe Russian military held large-scale military drills that began last week and ended Wednesday in the countrys east that involved forces from China. It was seen as another show of increasingly close ties between Moscow and Beijing amid tensions with the West over the military action in Ukraine.\n\nElena Becatoros in Sloviansk contributed to this report.",

                "cc_text": "The General Assembly today commemorated the International Day against Nuclear Tests, with speakers underscoring the urgent need for universal adherence and entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\n\nAbdulla Shahid (Maldives), President of the General Assembly, recalled that the International Day is observed on 29 August to commemorate the closing of Semipalatinsk, a nuclear test site in Kazakhstan, in 1991, and honour all those who lost their lives to nuclear tests. \"Twenty-five years after adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, we must redouble efforts to promote its universalization and implementation,\" he stressed, highlighting that the ongoing military confrontation in Ukraine has exacerbated the threat of a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nIzumi Nakamitsu, High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, said that, although the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was unable to reach consensus on an outcome document, States parties were united in their overwhelming support for a global ban on nuclear testing. Moreover, progress had been made on victim assistance, a focus that had grown out of the International Day against Nuclear Weapons and one that adds a human security dimension to the national and collective security perspectives. She voiced hope that the remaining Annex II States whose ratification is required for its entry into force will sign and ratify the Test-Ban Treaty and provide impetus for the rest of the non-Annex II States to join it.\n\nRobert Floyd, Executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, also highlighting delegations sincere and tireless efforts, said that four weeks of intense negotiations have laid the groundwork for real progress in the future. Noting that Dominica, Gambia, Timor-Leste and Tuvalu ratified the Test-Ban Treaty this year, he said: \"With Dominicas ratification, we have completed adherence to the CTBT in the Latin American and Caribbean region. With TimorLestes ratification, we have complete adherence in South-East Asia.\"\n\nVivian Okeke, Representative of the Director General to the United Nations and Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Liaison Office, New York, said that, for the past six decades, IAEA has helped to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, while making nuclear science and technology available for peaceful purposes, especially to developing countries. The Agencys recent mission to Zaporizhzhia has now set up a presence at the plant, she said, noting that IAEA has called for the urgent establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the plant.\n\nBenetick Kabua Maddison, Director of the Marshallese Educational Initiative, said that, due to the United States nuclear testing and forced relocation, Marshallese have some of highest rates of cancer and diabetes in the world. \"What we need most today is not only allies but actors,\" he said, calling on Government leaders to recognize the dangers of nuclear weapons production and use, take responsibility for the damage such testing has inflicted and then eliminate such weapons.\n\nMany delegations, united in their support for the Test-Ban Treaty, called on the remaining eight Annex II States to ratify it. Speakers also urged all States to abide by the moratorium on nuclear weapon test explosions and to refrain from any action that runs counter to the Treaty, pending its entry into force.\n\nThe representative of Mauritius, speaking for the African Group, voiced concern about nuclear-weapon States slow pace in eliminating their nuclear arsenals. Pointing to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of those weapons on health, the environment and other resources, he noted that the two failed Review Conferences plunges the Non-Proliferation Treaty into \"uncharted waters\", threatening its credibility.\n\nThe representative of Papua New Guinea, speaking for the Pacific Islands Forum, spotlighted the unresolved nuclear testing legacy issues in his region that continue to pose a danger to the livelihoods of the peoples there. He called on those responsible to address those issues, warning that the climate emergency and growing frequency of natural disasters across the globe has increased the risk of large-scale nuclear accidents.\n\nThailands delegate, speaking for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), pointed to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas intercontinental ballisticmissile launch as such a threat in his region. He reaffirmed his blocs position against nuclear tests, stressing that diplomatic efforts should remain the goal.\n\nTunisias representative, speaking for the Arab Group, reported that the Arab States have joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Yet, Israel violates all norms and rules set by that Treaty. He called for ridding the region of all weapons of mass destruction and urged all parties to negotiate a legally binding convention that promotes international and regional peace and security.\n\nThe representative of Argentina, speaking for the Community of Latin America and Caribbean States (CELAC), spotlighted her regions commitment to the universalization of the Comprehensive TestBan Treaty, noting that all States in the region have signed the instrument. Voicing concern over the rise, modernization, use and threat thereof of nuclear weapons, she underscored that use of those weapons would constitute a crime against humanity.\n\nThe representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, highlighted the Comprehensive TestBan Treaty Organizations verification regime. \"The CTBTO has provided the world with a truly global, high-tech monitoring system for nuclear explosions something that no single country could do,\" he pointed out. To strengthen the verification regime and build capacity in developing countries, the European Union, since 2006, has provided the organization with voluntary contributions of more than 29.5 million.\n\nThe General Assembly also resumed consideration of the topic \"International Cooperation for Access to Justice, Remedies and Assistance for Survivors of Sexual Violence\", with various delegations speaking in explanation of vote after adoption of the resolution, which took place on 2 September. (For background, see Press Release GA/12438.)\n\nAlso speaking on the International Day against Nuclear Tests were the representatives of Kazakhstan, Austria, Ecuador, Hungary, Colombia, China, Italy, Japan, Cote dIvoire, Iran, Brazil, Sri Lanka, United States and Kiribati.\n\nSpeaking in explanation of vote were the representatives of Guatemala, India, Syria, Belarus, Pakistan, Sudan, Egypt, Algeria, Brazil, Libya, Mauritania, Nigeria, Malaysia, Ethiopia and Japan.\n\nThe representatives of the Russian Federation, Israel, Ukraine, Iran and China spoke in exercise of the right of reply.\n\nThe General Assembly will next meet at 3 p.m. on Thursday, 8 September, to continue its work.\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nABDULLA SHAHID (Maldives), President of the General Assembly, said that the International Day against Nuclear Tests is observed on 29 August to commemorate the closing of Semipalatinsk, a nuclear test site in Kazakhstan, on 29 August 1991. The yearly observance commemorates all those who tragically lost their lives to nuclear tests, as well as a reminder of the serious impacts those tests have on human health and environment, which can last generations. \"We must ensure that we have a strong and united and most importantly global front in our mission to ban nuclear testing,\" he said, calling on the international community to implement all existing instruments towards that end. In that regard, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty provides a strong legal framework, he said, stressing: \"Twenty-five years after its adoption, we must redouble efforts to promote its universalization and implementation.\" Member States who had not yet signed the Treaty should do so without delay, particularly the remaining Annex II States, as their ratification is needed for the Treaty to enter into force.\n\nHe went on to say that the ongoing military confrontation in Ukraine, which has exacerbated the looming threat of a nuclear catastrophe by accident, has increased the urgency of nuclear disarmament efforts. He urged all parties to work to exercise maximum restraint and promote dialogue and diplomacy. With an estimated stockpile of 13,000 nuclear warheads around the world, all Member States without exception must fulfil their commitments towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Recalling the holding of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons in August, he highlighted States parties efforts and commitment during intensive negotiations, despite an outcome document not being adopted.\n\nHe voiced his hope that States parties will continue to engage in constructive and meaningful dialogue to reaffirm their commitment to that treaty as a corner stone of global disarmament and non-proliferation regime. \"As we mark the international day against nuclear tests, let us recommit by working together and taking concrete action. The only way of bringing hope to the people is by delivering a world free of nuclear weapons,\" he emphasized. \"Let us work together to achieve that world.\"\n\nIZUMI NAKAMITSU, High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, affirming that \"nuclear testing is abhorrent and its legacy is nothing but toxic\", stressed that the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty must remain an urgent priority for all States. She described the inability, last month, of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach consensus on a substantive outcome as \"a lost opportunity\" to strengthen the Treaty and advance its goals. While parties had engaged in sincere and meaningful dialogue, and were prepared to join the consensus, only one State party had objections on the draft final outcome document.\n\nNonetheless, she said a key issue on which States parties were united was their overwhelming support for a global ban on nuclear testing, noting that, in the draft outcome document, the Conference reaffirmed the importance of the entry into force of the Test-Ban Treaty at the earliest possible date, as a means to constrain the development and improvement of nuclear weapons. Also in the draft, the Conference welcomed the increased attention in the last review cycle on assistance to the people and communities affected by weapons testing and environmental remediation, building on the obligations contained in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and the work States parties have done to establish a process for their implementation.\n\nA focus on victim assistance is one area of progress that has grown from the International Day against Nuclear Tests, she continued, underscoring that it adds a human security dimension to the national and collective security perspectives. Indeed, the devastation wrought by explosive nuclear tests has lingered for decades, tormenting not just people who lived in the era of unrestrained atmospheric and underwater nuclear tests, but their succeeding generations. Stressing that the global norm against nuclear testing has been firmly upheld in the twenty-first century, with one important exception, she joined others in calling on the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to refrain from further nuclear testing, to join the Test-Ban Treaty and to immediately work with relevant parties towards the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nRecalling that September 2021 marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Test-Ban Treaty, she spotlighted that, under the \"relentless energy\" of Executive Secretary Floyd, four States have joined the instrument. She expressed hope that this will motivate the eight remaining Annex II States whose ratification is required for its entry into force to sign and ratify the Test Ban Treaty and provide impetus for the rest of the non-Annex II States, of which fewer than 12 now remain, to join it.\n\n\"Times are not good,\" she observed. The risk of nuclear weapons use is the highest since the cold war. Relationships between nuclear-armed States continue to corrode, and nuclear weapons are assuming greater roles in national security doctrines. Further, there are new reports about a possible resumption of nuclear testing by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. \"If we are to prevent catastrophe, we must urgently correct course and accelerate efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament,\" she stressed. Ending testing once and for all, by bringing the Test-Ban Treaty into force and making the legally binding prohibition on nuclear explosive tests a permanent reality, is a step all must strive to take. She called for redoubled efforts towards this outcome, and in turn, realizing the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.\n\nROBERT FLOYD, Executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization , said that, although the Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons recently concluded deliberations without consensus on a final document, he saw cause for optimism. Despite the disappointing outcome, he observed many delegations sincere and tireless efforts and heard the resounding calls for action. \"These four weeks of intense negotiations have laid the groundwork for real progress in the future,\" he said. Turning to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, he said that, in this, the twenty-fifth anniversary year of the opening for signature of the Treaty, Dominica, Gambia, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu ratified the Treaty, with many more States on their way. \"With Dominicas ratification, we have completed adherence to the CTBT in the Latin American and Caribbean region. With Timor-Lestes ratification, we have complete adherence in South-East Asia,\" he reported, highlighting them as historical milestones and commending those countries for their efforts.\n\nThe Treaty Organizations means of verification comprises a state-of-the-art international data centre and a global network of monitoring stations, which have proven their efficacy time and again, he continued. This critical asset will continue to deliver on the promise to detect any nuclear explosion, anytime, anywhere. For that reason, it must be properly sustained. Moreover, the data gathered contributes to tsunami warning systems, earthquake and climate change studies, as well as a multitude of other civil and scientific applications. As such, he has launched the National Data Centres for All Initiative an effort to ensure that all States signatories of the Treaty can use this data to the fullest, for the benefit of all, particularly the smallest of States. Despite those impressive achievements, the international communitys work is not yet done. The only way there can be an enduring and verifiable prohibition on nuclear testing is through the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \"So, to each of you, and the nations of the world that you represent, lets recommit ourselves to this noble cause, and lets finish what we started,\" he said.\n\nVIVIAN OKEKE, Representative of the Director General to the United Nations and Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Liaison Office, New York, speaking on behalf of Director General, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that, for the past six decades, IAEA has helped to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, while making nuclear science and technology available for peaceful purposes, especially to developing countries. In fact, nuclear science and technology contribute directly to more than half of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and indirectly to all of them. It cures diseases, helps feed the hungry, protects the environment and powers progress without harming the planet.\n\nOutlining its efforts, she recalled that IAEA responded quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic by delivering to Member States the biggest emergency response programme in its near seven-decade history. It launched the Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action initiative, or ZODIAC, which helps countries prepare and respond to zoonotic outbreak. The \"Rays of Hope\" project, meanwhile, steps up the Agencys commitment to cancer control, while the Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellowship offers financial support to women studying towards a masters degree in nuclear subjects. IAEA also develops safety standards that can be used as the basis for national regulations and provides, upon request, various services, including expert review missions. Countries increasingly seek IAEA help in minimizing the risk of nuclear and other radioactive material falling into the hands of terrorists.\n\nAnother core IAEA function is to verify that countries are not working to acquire nuclear weapons, she continued. Agency inspectors conduct verification at nuclear facilities all over the world, bringing back samples which are analysed for possible traces of nuclear material. As the competent authority entrusted to verify States compliance with their non-proliferation obligations, the Agency does this by implementing safeguards internationally approved legal and technical measures in 187 States, of which 184are States parties to the NonProliferation Treaty. Further, 139 of these States have brought additional protocols into force, giving the Agency greater access to locations and information.\n\nShe also noted that the Director General sends letters recalling these obligations, urging States with small quantities protocols based on the old standard text to amend or rescind them. \"This is essential to addressing a weakness in the IAEA safeguards system,\" recognized by the Board of Governors 15 years ago, she explained. Turning to IAEAs efforts in Ukraine, she said the Agencys Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia, deployed last week to assess the situation, has now set up a presence at the plant. The Director Generals second report details IAEAs actions, findings and recommendations for nuclear safety, security and safeguards in Ukraine, including a call for the urgent establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the plant. She also pointed to the low enriched uranium bank in Kazakhstan, operational since December 2019, as another milestone, as well as assistance offered to States to characterize residual radioactivity in areas affected by nuclear weapons tests.\n\nBENETICK KABUA MADDISON, Director of the Marshallese Educational Initiative , said the Marshall Islands has been the home of its people for more than 4,000 years. Marshallese culture is based on principles of sustainability and conservation. Unfortunately, the sustainable way of life is under threat. The Marshallese people are on the front line of climate change, with environmental challenges and exploitation of the Marshall Islands resources forcing more families like his own to migrate.\n\nHe went on to say that, between 1946 to 1958, the United States used the Marshall Islands to test 67 nuclear weapons, equivalent to 7,200 Hiroshima bonds. In the late 1970s, the United States built a concrete dome on Eniwetak, one of two islands used for nuclear testing. They dumped nuclear waste into the structure, which is now leaking nuclear contaminants into the environment. As a result of the nucleartesting programme, the Marshall Islands and the United States signed the first compact of free association in 1986, allowing Marshallese to migrate to the United States for employment, education and the hope of access to health care.\n\nDue to nuclear testing and forced relocation, Marshallese have some of highest rates of cancer and diabetes in the world, he pointed out. They are also especially vulnerable to COVID-19 due to health issues that are a direct result of radiation exposure and forced relocation. With a long history of advocacy for environmental and nuclear justice and with allies worldwide, Marshallese political leaders and community advocates are continuing to fight for nuclear and climate justice. With the help of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, the Marshall Islands sued nine nuclearweapon States in 2014. Although the case was not won, the issue received international attention and support.\n\nThe Marshall Islands will continue to educate and raise awareness of effects of nuclear testing and climate change, he stated. \"What we need most today is not only allies but actors,\" he said, calling on Government leaders to recognize the dangers of nuclear weapons production and use, take responsibility for the damage thy have inflicted and then eliminate such weapons. The Marshall Islands and the United States recently restarted negotiations for the next compact of free association, he noted, voicing hope that the next compact will fully and fairly address the nuclear legacy and climate change.\n\nStatements\n\nJAGDISH DHARAMCHAND KOONJUL ( Mauritius ), speaking for the African Group, and adding his support for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, reiterated the urgent need for the planet, including outer space, to be free of nuclear weapons. Also expressing support for the principle of complete nuclear disarmament, he said all parties, especially nuclearweapon States and those under the \"nuclear umbrella\", must sign and ratify the Treaty. The slow pace of nuclearweapon States in eliminating their nuclear arsenals, in accordance with their article VI obligations, was very concerning, he said.\n\nThe Treaty of Pelindaba reaffirms the status of Africa as a nuclear-weapon-free zone and shield for the African territory, by preventing the stationing of nuclear explosive devices on the continent, he continued. He underlined the continued validity of the 1995 resolution, which is the basis upon which the NonProliferation was indefinitely extended, calling on all States to consider the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons on health, the environment and other resources. Having two failed Review Conferences back-to-back plunges the Non-Proliferation Treaty into \"uncharted waters\", he said, leaving its credibility \"in deep trouble\". He called on all States that have yet to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to do so.\n\nMAGZHAN ILYASSOV ( Kazakhstan ) stressed that nuclear weapons are now moving from global to regional deterrence, increasing hazardous conditions in the case of an actual nuclear war between State actors. Further, the risk of cybercrime attacks and weapons falling in the hands of terrorists is also challenging. \"Even the possibility of using one or two of the 13,000 nuclear warheads existing today, is enough to destroy us and our planet,\" he reported. Thus, he urged that new nuclear-weapon-free zones be established, particularly in the Middle East, and similar to what exists in Africa, South America, South-East Asia and the Pacific the entire Southern hemisphere. In 2009, his country, together with its neighbours, created a Nuclear-WeaponFree Zone in Central Asia, the first in the Northern hemisphere, flanked by two mighty nuclear-weapon-possessing States. The entry into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons earlier this year strengthens Member States collective hope for a world free of nuclear weapons. Proposing Member States achieve Global Zero by the United Nations centennial in 2045, he said it was a goal worth striving for and not impossible to reach. \"Let us not forget the horrific consequences of nuclear weapons used in 1945 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the haunting tragedies of four decades of nuclear weapons testing in Kazakhstan, the South Pacific, North Africa, North America and other regions,\" he said, urging the remaining Annex II States to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty without delay.\n\nSURIYA CHINDAWONGSE ( Thailand ), speaking for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said solidarity on nuclear issues is essential, particularly amid the unsettling global geopolitical landscape. Describing current concerns as \"real and existential\", he called on all States to show good faith, promote mutual understanding and take responsible, collective actions to promote a peaceful world. He also reaffirmed ASEANs position against nuclear tests and underscored the importance of achieving universal adherence to the Test-Ban Treaty. Noting that all ASEAN member States have ratified that instrument, he urged remaining Annex II States to sign and ratify the treaty as soon as possible. He deplored the conduct of nuclear tests, recognizing their dire humanitarian consequences on health, the environment and sustainable development. Further, he voiced his regret that the tenth Review Conference of the Parties was unable to produce an outcome document.\n\nRecognizing the role of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in efforts to foster peace, security and sustainable development, he urged all States parties to renew their adherence to the Treaty, including its article VI. ASEAN is committed to maintaining its region as a zone free from nuclear weapons, he said, as outlined in the Treaty of Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, or \"Bangkok Treaty\". Recalling that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons an historic accord held its first meeting of States parties in June, he expressed support for the Secretary-Generals disarmament agenda to advance these goals in a holistic and integrated manner. He also cited the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas intercontinental ballistic missile launch as a threat to the region, stressing that diplomatic efforts including the creation of a conducive environment for peaceful dialogue should remain the goal.\n\nSILVIO GONZATO, representative of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, said all European Union member States have ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. He called upon the remaining eight Annex II States: China, Egypt, Iran, Israel and the United States who still need to ratify the Treaty, and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, India and Pakistan who still need to sign and ratify the Treaty in order to bring it into force, to do so without any preconditions or further delay. He also called on all States to abide by the moratorium on nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions, and to refrain from any action contrary to the object and purpose of the Treaty, pending its entry into force. Voicing regret that, due to one countrys objection, it has not been possible to achieve consensus on a final outcome document at the tenth Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, he said the bloc will continue to promote the full and effective implementation of that Treaty, as well as its universalization, and called on all States Parties to do the same.\n\nTurning to the current security environment, he called on the Russian Federation to end its aggression immediately and withdraw its troops from Ukraine. He also urged the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to cease its unlawful and destabilizing actions that undermine regional and international peace and security. He recalled that, following that countrys nuclear tests, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization quickly provided reliable and independent data, enabling the international community to respond appropriately and swiftly. \"The CTBTO has provided the world with a truly global, high-tech monitoring system for nuclear explosions something that no single country could do,\" he said. Moreover, the Treaty Organizations integrated capacity-building assists States in using \"IM35S data\" for civil and scientific applications and research associated with Treaty-related verification technologies, including tsunami and volcanic ash cloud warning. Since 2006, the European Union has provided the Treaty Organization with voluntary contributions of more than 29.5 million to fund a variety of technical projects to strengthen the verification regime and build capacity in developing countries.\n\nMARA DEL CARMEN SQUEFF ( Argentina ), speaking for the Community of Latin America and Caribbean States (CELAC), recalled resolutions 64/35 of 2009 and 72/51 of 2017, declaring 29 August as International Day against Nuclear Tests. She condemned the conduct of any nuclear tests, insisting that all States refrain from carrying them out, including through simulations seeking to improve their efficiency. These actions contravene the purpose of the non-proliferation regime, the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, she said, recalling that 186 Member States signed and 174 ratified the latter instrument, and welcoming ratifications completed this year by the Gambia, TimorLeste and Tuvalu an important step towards universalization.\n\nShe also welcomed Dominicas signing and ratification of the accord. In Latin America, all States have signed the instrument, demonstrating the regions commitment to universalization. She underscored the urgency of implementing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, pressing Annex II States to take measures to do so without delay. She expressed deep concern over the rise, modernization, use and threat thereof of nuclear weapons, stressing that these weapons should not be used under any circumstances, as this would constitute a crime against humanity. Drawing attention to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean known as the Treaty of Tlatelolco she reiterated the blocs commitment to maintaining the region as a nuclearweaponfree zone.\n\nMAX HUFANEN RAI ( Papua New Guinea ), speaking for the Pacific Islands Forum, said the unresolved nuclear testing legacy issues in the Pacific region continue to pose a clear and present danger to the livelihoods of the peoples there. He called on those responsible to take urgent and meaningful steps to address these lingering issues. A preliminary independent review relating to nuclear contamination in the Pacific will support the evidentiary basis for actions that his region continues to take on nuclear testing legacy issues. The nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific represents a key contribution to protecting all of humankind from nuclear weapons and testing. The Treaty of Rarotonga successfully eliminated nuclear weapons and testing from the Pacific 26 years ago and has helped to denuclearize a number of regions of the world, he said, calling on the United States to ratify the Rarotonga Treatys Protocols.\n\nHe urged all States to not carry out nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions; maintain their moratoria in that regard; and refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty. Condemning the six nuclear tests conducted by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea since 2006, he urged full compliance with obligations under relevant Council resolutions. Further, the climate emergency and growing frequency of natural disasters across the globe has increased the risk of large-scale nuclear accidents. He called on the international community to join his bloc in pursuing the highest standards of nuclear safety through international consultation, international law and support for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), voicing hope for global solidarity to safeguard against further nuclear contamination and injustices.\n\nTAREK LADEB ( Tunisia ), speaking for the Arab Group, called for the complete, verifiable and irreversible ban on nuclear weapons and expressed regret that the tenth Review Conference of State Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty was unable to adopt an outcome document. States are developing nuclear weapons in line with their military doctrines and carrying out tests, an existential threat that the international community must diligently address. The full elimination of nuclear weapons is a realistic, achievable goal, he stressed, adding that the real threat was the non-implementation of the Treatys article VI or commitments adopted at various Review Conferences. He rejected the argument that the possession of nuclear weapons is a pretext for global stability, calling on States to ensure the complete elimination of their arsenals along a defined timeline as \"the very least\" they can do to address the impact of their testing.\n\nHe called for continued international and regional efforts to facilitate the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which has been signed for more than 25 years. Arab States have joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty, participated in negotiations for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and supported efforts of the preparatory committee. The region was a striking example of the persistent challenges, as Israel violates all norms and rules set by the NonProliferation Treaty. He called for ridding the region of all weapons of mass destruction, in line with the 1995 and 2010 Review Conferences, and Security Council resolutions 487 (1981) and 678 (1990). He urged all parties to negotiate a legally binding convention that promotes international and regional peace and security.\n\nRight of Reply\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation , speaking in exercise of the right of reply, objected to politicized statements on the unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, despite the fact that explanations have been presented on several occasions. The most flagrant threat to the Zaporizhzhia plant stems from Ukraines unceasing shelling. \"This bombardment continues daily,\" targeting the most vulnerable part of the station, he pointed out. The Russian Federation has released statistics to the Security Council, which he encouraged all to analyse. While Western delegations understand where the shells come from, they refuse to recognize that Kyiv has turned the plant into a target of nuclear blackmail.\n\nHe said claims that the shelling does not emanate from Ukraine \"simply contradict common sense because the station is under Russian control\". To claims about the outcome of the tenth Review Conference, he said his delegation worked constructively with all partners, yet Western countries took the forum \"hostage\" in their desire to punish his country \"at all costs\", making it impossible for the outcome to be adopted. He recalled, however, that, in 2015, the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, guided by selfish considerations, blocked the outcome of the ninth Review Conference. The Russian Federation has always supported and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 2000, he said, urging all Annex II States to support the instrument and stressing that nuclear tests must be considered through a holistic approach. He also recalled that 1,054 tests had been carried out by the United States.\n\nThe representative of Israel , recognizing the importance of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, said all States have the sovereign right to determine whether to join any international instrument. Iran obstructs such international efforts. Some claim a security architecture can be established in the Middle East without recognition of Israels right to exist and in disregard of norms and principles agreed upon in arms control forums. \"This position is untenable,\" he said.\n\nThe representative of Ukraine said the Russian Federation is promoting its classic narrative around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. \"We are not surprised,\" he said, noting that the Council meeting on 6 September revealed again how isolated the Russian Federation is, a point confirmed by its delegate who said there was no time to consider the IAEA report. Only one delegation the Russian Federation is responsible for nuclear threats and risks around the plant. The IAEA report confirmed the presence of Russian military and equipment at the plant, and violation by the Russian Federation of the seven IAEA pillars of nuclear safety and security. \"It is only Russa that uses military force,\" he said, insisting that Ukraine has been very clear, including at the tenth Review Conference and in the Security Council that the Russian Federation bears full responsibility for its actions and presents a clear threat to nuclear safety and stability.\n\nThe representative of Iran categorically rejected the outrageous accusation made by Israel against his country, describing it as a policy of deflection and emphasizing that weapons of mass destruction in the hands of this regime are the real risk to regional security. He encouraged the international community to force Israel to ban weapons of mass destruction.\n\nInternational Cooperation/Access to Justice for Sexual Violence Survivors\n\nFollowing the Assemblys adoption on 2 September of a resolution titled \"International Cooperation for Access to Justice, Remedies and Assistance for Survivors of Sexual Violence\" (document A/76/L.80), it resumed consideration of the topic today, with various delegations speaking in explanation of vote after action. (For background, see Press Release GA/12438.)\n\nThe representative of Guatemala said her country, in accordance with the provisions of its Constitution regarding the protection of life from conception, dissociates itself from operative paragraph 6. It contains references to sexual and reproductive rights, as well as to abortion in conditions of safety when such services are allowed by national legislation; that could be interpreted as abortion practices, which is counter to its national legislation. Her Government implements a comprehensive care model for women victims of violence, which offers immediate and comprehensive care.\n\nThe representative of Syria voiced regret that the amendments proposed by Nigeria were not included in the text. His delegation has always been against instrumentalizing the text to deviate from \"survivors of sexual violence\". However, the resolution is full of references to \"gender-based violence\" which cannot substantiate nor substitute the terms \"sexual violence\" and \"violence against women\". Citing various paragraphs and terms from which his delegation has disassociated itself, he said the adoption of the resolution cannot be interpreted as creating a new right or creating any international legally binding obligations.\n\nThe representative of India said his country joined consensus on the resolution. However, due to the use of phrases and terminology which do not have agreed definitions, and given that India is not part of some of the international conventions and instruments contained in the text, his delegation disassociates itself from preambular paragraphs 2, 10, 11 and 16, and operative paragraph 6.\n\nThe representative of Belarus said her delegation could not support the full draft, due to wording that is not universally supported and that shift the issues from the legal element to concepts that are not agreed upon internationally. Belarus co-sponsored the amendments in effort to create a more balanced text. She expressed regret that they were not adopted. While expressing full support for the goals of the resolution, she said Belarus will interpret the text in line with its national legislation and international legal obligations. She called on partners to respect the decisions of all Member States and avoid to terms that sow divisions among Assembly delegations.\n\nThe representative of Pakistan voiced regret that non-consensual language and controversial terms, although not agreed upon, were retained in certain paragraphs of the resolution. Those terms are also not recognized by his countrys domestic laws, he said, stressing that the negotiations process should be inclusive and consensual. While his delegation fully supports the overarching theme of the resolution, it reserves its position and disassociates itself from preambular paragraphs 8 and 16 and operative paragraphs 2(a) and 6 for the same reason that it voted in favour of the amendments to those paragraphs.\n\nThe representative of Sudan , spotlighting paragraphs 2(a) and 6 said she attached great importance to the advancement of womens rights and participation in society at all levels. However, the text deviated from its goal with the inclusion of contentious wording and terminology. She emphasized the principle of respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal State affairs, explaining that Sudan voted in favour of the amendments to make the resolution \"balanced, acceptable and agreed upon\". As they were not retained, she expressed reservations on operative paragraphs 8, 16 and 6.\n\nThe representative of Egypt said that, while her delegation joined consensus due to importance of the topic at hand, the resolution would have been improved in terms of legal accuracy, including of the word \"victims\" in the title. She lamented the lack of transparency and fairness in the negotiation process, stressing that programme budget implications were used as bargaining chip. This method is unprecedented and threatens common ownership. She cited preambular paragraphs 8, 16 and 3, and operative paragraphs 2 and 6, noting that her delegation does not consider the language as consensual or agreed.\n\nThe representative of Algeria expressed regret that the amendments were not included in the text, as they would have made it more balanced as a whole, representing the positions of several countries expressed since its tabling. She expressed reservations on terms such as \"multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination\" and \"intimate partner\", which can be interpreted in various ways. \"We should not promote abortion as a means of family planning,\" she added, cautioning agencies from interfering in the domestic policies of States. Further, the concept of sexual and reproductive health and rights is considered part of health care, in line with Algerias national legislation, she pointed out.\n\nThe representative of Brazil said his delegation decided to support adoption of the resolution. However, it contains important aspects that do not belong in the text and would be better addressed by domestic constituencies. In particular, his country does not support references to reproductive rights or abortion in the draft and has called for their deletion from the text. The resolution should not be interpreted in any way as condoning or supporting abortion as a matter of family planning. In Brazil, abortion is illegal except in specific cases prescribed by law or high court decisions, such as pregnancy resulting from rape.\n\nThe representative of Libya said his delegation joined consensus in adopting the entire resolution. However, he said that he cannot accept text that has been incorporated in some of the paragraphs of the resolution, as they do not take into consideration the cultural and religious specificities of certain countries, including his own. With respect to various terms, including \"intimate partner\" and \"gender-based violence\", his delegation does not accept its interpretation, except as violence against girls, boys, men and women. Also, it does not accept references to \"safe abortion\" because it runs counter to the right to life a foundation for all human rights. His delegation supported the four proposed amendments to the draft and voted against operative paragraph 6.\n\nThe representative of Mauritania , stressing that abortion is not a human right, said her country disassociates itself from operative paragraph 6. It is a prerogative of national policies that the Government must provide necessary social support and health care prior to and after delivery. Citing objections to language in other paragraphs of the resolution, she voiced regret that language, which has not garnered international consensus and is not provided for in its national policies or laws, are included in the text.\n\nThe representative of Nigeria , citing highly problematic language, said his delegation could not join consensus on the text. Certain terms contravene Nigerias laws and he denounced the inflexibility of the co-sponsors. \"We never agreed to a single paragraph by consensus,\" he said. The proposed amendments were based on well-known positions, in the spirit of compromise. However, the cosponsors would not entertain them, and he urged them to do better in the future. He announced Nigerias withdrawal from the core group, as it introduced controversial language. He also said that some delegations felt intimidated and pressured, a sign that \"the negotiations were deeply flawed\".\n\nBecause of his objection to the introduction of controversial language by the co-sponsors that had no basis in international human rights law, he disassociated his delegation from operative paragraph 6, which promotes access to safe abortion as an element of human rights. \"We should not be creating new rights,\" he said, noting that abortion is illegal in his country. He also objected to \"access to sexual and reproductive health services\", noting that operative paragraph 6 is misinterpreted by donors and partners.\n\nIn addition, he disassociated from references to \"multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination\" in preambular paragraphs 8 and 2(a), and the phase \"intimate partner violence\" in paragraph 16, which includes ideas that are not recognized in Nigerias laws. He clarified that the term \"gender\" has no meaning beyond \"male\" and \"female\". Nigerias opposition to these paragraphs is in defence of its values, domestic laws and sovereignty, he added.\n\nThe representative of Malaysia welcomed the presentation of a stand-alone resolution on the important topic, a sign of the shared international recognition of the need to address sexual violence. He voiced regret that the text includes \"divisive, contentious terms\" that are inconsistent with positions of many countries. While his delegation would like to support the text to provide survivors with proper access to justice, the inclusion of problematic terms \"by choice\" prevented it from so doing. Therefore, his delegation disassociates from such terms as \"multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination\" and \"diverse situations\" found in preambular paragraph 8 and operative paragraphs 2(a), 2(k) and 6. Malaysia does not recognize these terms as agreed language, despite the consensual adoption of the text as a whole, he said.\n\nThe representative of Ethiopia pointed out that no consensus was reached due to a lack of openness to listen and accommodate the concerns of several delegations. The process could have been inclusive and not involved nonconsensual language. Every process must aim at consensus, be inclusive and seek a focused outcome. Each nation has a right take sovereign position on issues, depending on their national context. His delegation disassociates from terms such as \"multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination\" in preambular paragraph 8 and operative paragraph 2(a), as well as \"intimate partner violence\" in preambular paragraph 16.\n\nHe said he understood \"sexual and reproductive health service, and reproductive rights\", as access to health care to ensure the health of mothers, new-borns and young people by improving treatment, family planning and information on sexually transmitted diseases, among other issues. As well, he defined the term \"gender\" as referring to the male and female sex. Further, Ethiopia is not a party to the Rome Statute and does not recognize the International Criminal Court, its jurisdiction or reference to the tribunal in the text, he said.\n\nThe representative of Japan said his delegation voted against the four draft amendments presented by Nigeria to the draft resolution since the relevant paragraphs to which the amendments were proposed are based on language adopted by consensus or by vote in past resolutions. He thanked all delegations that supported the original language and all delegations that joined consensus in adopting the firstever resolution on the topic. He also thanked delegations, which had some issues on the text, but did not ask for a vote for the sake of consensual adoption.\n\nNoting the \"somewhat politicized references\" to his country by two delegations during the debate and explanation of vote on 2 September, he said his country decided to contribute to the process in light of its \"responsibility to continue to inherit the past in all humbleness and pass it on to the future\".\n\nRight of Reply",

                "cc_text": "Image Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Kyiv, Ukraine, last week. Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times\n\nShelling at a nuclear plant in Ukraine has \"gravely concerned\" international monitors who believe a security protection zone should be established immediately, the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency said in a report on Tuesday after inspectors visited the embattled Zaporizhzhia facility.\n\nBut the experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency said the fighting has not triggered a nuclear emergency at the plant in southern Ukraine, which has become one of the critical flash points in the war since Russia invaded in February..\n\nMonitors from the I.A.E.A., including the agencys director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, visited the facility last week amid continuing shelling of the area that at one point forced them to take cover. In a report on its findings, the agency said that shelling should be \"stopped immediately\" and that it was prepared to start consultations with both sides in the conflict over security at the plant, which is the largest in Europe.\n\nFor weeks, fighting around the large facility which was seized by Russian forces in March but is operated by Ukrainian engineers has raised fears of a nuclear accident. A dry spent fuel storage facility was damaged last month and, in recent days, there has been a fire and loss of outside power to the plant. On Monday, renewed shelling caused a fire that once again led to the plant being disconnected from Ukraines national power grid, which Ukraines energy minister said placed critical cooling systems at risk of relying solely on emergency backup power.\n\n\"While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance,\" the report said.\n\nThe monitors reported seeing Russian military equipment parked inside buildings, damage to the facilities that posed a hazard to workers, and restrictions on the plants Ukrainian operators to access certain parts of the facility, including to plants cooling ponds.\n\nRussian military personnel also occupied the plants on-site emergency center, the inspectors said, adding that an alternative site for the plant workers use \"did not provide for fulfillment of all response functions as needed.\"\n\nRussias permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, said that Mr. Grossi \"didnt give concrete details\" about his proposed security protection zone, according to RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency. Mr. Ulyanov said that Moscow would wait for Mr. Grossi to explain his approach before making any steps.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in his nightly address, said his country also needed to look at the specifics of a plan.\n\n\"If the content of this proposal is to demilitarize the territory of the nuclear power plant and this is logical, as it was the Russian military presence that put the Zaporizhzhia plant on the brink of a radiation disaster then we can support such a demilitarized protection zone,\" he said.\n\nThe plant, which lies on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, is strategically significant as a critical piece of Ukraines energy infrastructure. In addition, the Zaporizka region borders an area where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counteroffensive that aims to reclaim territory lost to Russia at the start of the war.\n\nThe report noted that the plants workers are under \"constant high stress and pressure,\" saying the situation was \"not sustainable.\" One worker was injured by shelling last month, according to the report.\n\nBoth countries have blamed the other for the shelling around the plant.\n\n\"The hits that this facility has received, and that I could personally see and assess together with my experts, is simply unacceptable,\" Mr. Grossi told the United Nations Security Council later Tuesday. \"We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place.\"\n\nWhile it can call for changes, the agency, like other U.N. bodies, has limited power to influence events and instead relies on the consent of governing parties. At the same time, the Russian invasion has presented the agency with an unprecedented challenge in the form of a nuclear facility that has become a combat zone.\n\nMr. Zelensky called for the I.A.E.A. to be empowered to \"force Russia to demilitarize the territory\" of the plant and return control to Ukraine. He said the world needed \"adequate means\" to compel Russia, but did not describe what that would entail.\n\nThe I.A.E.A. avoided blaming Kyiv or Moscow for the damage at the plant, but said in its report that military equipment at the site \"undermined the designed physical protection systems\" at the facility. Noting the presence of Russian military trucks at the plant including inside the turbine halls of two reactors, the report recommended the removal of vehicles from areas that could interfere with the operation of safety and security systems.\n\nAfter the I.A.E.A.s visit to the plant last week, which followed intensive negotiations with both sides to guarantee security, some inspectors remained at the site.\n\nIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.",

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\n\"The day has come,\" Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) declared Monday, marking the beginning of his journey to the largest nuclear plant in Europe that sits on the fire line between the Russian occupiers and Ukrainian forces.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of 14 inspectors led by Grossi arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP) in southern Ukraine, despite concerns about constant shelling in the area.\n\nSince early March, when Russia captured the plant, international and local experts have voiced grave warnings, not only for the safety of the plants workers, but also for fear of a nuclear disaster that could affect thousands of people in the surrounding area.\n\nHeres a closer look at the perilous situation at the plant:\n\nThe significance of the plant\n\nUkraine relies heavily on nuclear power about half of its electricity comes from 15 nuclear reactors at four plants across the country, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n\nZaporizhzhia NPP, with six reactors, is the largest nuclear power station in Europe. It was mostly built in the Soviet era and became Ukrainian property after its declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nUntil recently, only two reactors were connected to Ukraines national grid and providing power, though the units have been taken offline at various points and for various reasons since the invasion.\n\nWhere is it and who controls it?\n\nZaporizhzhia NPP is located on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river in Ukraine. The area, and the nuclear complex, has been under Russian control since the beginning of the war, but the plant is still mostly operated by Ukrainian workers.\n\nAt the start of the invasion, Ukrainian forces stopped Russian forces from capturing a second nuclear facility the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant and forced them to retreat to Dnipro, according to Petro Kotin, president of Energoatom, which runs nuclear power plants in Ukraine. The frontline hasnt moved much in months.\n\nEach of Zaporizhzhias reactors would cost $7 billion to replace, making the plant a target for Russians to capture undamaged, with hopes of serving its own electricity market, according to analysis by defense and security intelligence firm Janes. Should Russia keep it, Ukraine would lose 20% of its domestic electricity generating capacity.\n\nWhat does its position on the frontline mean?\n\nShelling in the surrounding towns as well as near the power plant is common, according to local reports.\n\nUkraine has accused Russian forces of storing weaponry and launching attacks from the plant, knowing that Ukraine cant return fire without risking hitting the nuclear facility. Russia in turn claims Ukrainian forces are targeting the site.\n\nThe international community has been on high alert about nuclear safety, yet experts believe a Chernobyl-style disaster is unlikely. The plant is equipped with modern security systems, meaning even if there was neglect to its upkeep, or major military action caused serious damage, the result would be most comparable to the nuclear disaster in Fukushima which was contained locally, according to Janes and Energoatom.\n\nYet risks remain, one of which is potential damage to nuclear waste stored openly on site in ponds of water and in casks, according to Kotin from Energoatom.\n\nKotin has also warned that Russian attempts to switch the plant from the Ukrainian to the Russian power grid would require disconnecting all the reactors from power for a certain time, relying on emergency power generation never failing a \"very dangerous\" prospect, he told CNN in an August 22 interview.\n\nWhich parts of the plant have been affected by the conflict?\n\nThe plants main exclusion security zone, where the reactors and nuclear fuel are located, is surrounded by Dnipro waters to the northwest and Enerhodar town to the east.\n\nThe below satellite image highlights the plants facilities, which are vital to the accompanying timeline of events since the war began. They show just how narrowly Zaporizhzhia NPP has avoided a nuclear disaster.\n\nKey developments at the plant since the start of the war March 4, 2022 Russian troops take control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP), with operators working at \"gunpoint,\" according to Ukrainian nuclear officials. Russian shelling damages buildings around one nuclear reactor and Ukrainian authorities say a fire breaks out at a training center outside the main site.

                "cc_text": "Nuclear weapons: Review of non-proliferation treaty ends without consensus amid fears over Zaporizhzhia power plant\n\nRepeated shelling at Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which began in mid-August, has greatly intensified fears of nuclear disaster. The Zaporizhzhia plant one of the worlds largest nuclear stations fell to Russian military forces soon after Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nRafael Mariano Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) the UN body responsible for overseeing the civil nuclear industry has expressed grave concern over the situation. He issued a statement in late August explaining that the shelling underlines the risk of a potential nuclear accident at the power plant, which continues to be operated by Ukrainian staff.\n\nAny conflict over land holding nuclear plants carries risks of a disaster. In times of war opposing states have to agree what is off limits, as an attack upon a nuclear facility of one will lead to a response attack by the other with similar if not greater consequences, explains Steven Kay QC, Member of the IBA War Crimes Committee Advisory Board and Head of Chambers at 9 Bedford Row in London. The IAEA and the UN Security Council has to become involved to prevent the spread of the conflict to other states of radiation that is not an accidental outage.\n\nThe IAEA successfully led a support and assistance mission to the plant at the end of August, following international calls for access, where the damage to and safety of the site was assessed. Grossi confirmed in early September that the physical integrity of the station has been violated and that two IAEA experts will remain at the plant to monitor the situation. The global Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and other treaties limiting the spread of nuclear weapons give the IAEA, as the nuclear inspectorate, safeguarding powers including the ability to verify that a state is abiding by its international commitments not to deploy programmes for nuclear weapons purposes. The IAEA followed its visit with a report about the safety, security and safeguards situation in Ukraine, including the findings from the mission to Zaporizhzhia, in which it expressed concern about the level of stress staff at the plant are experiencing. Its hoped that a forensic evaluation will also be possible to ascertain and hold those responsible for the attacks on the nuclear power plant accountable for the damage.

In fact, it has given rise to warnings of an [event] akin to Chernobyl, although experts have emphasised that a similar replication of the 1986 disaster is effectively impossible, explains Toby Cadman, Communications Officer of the IBA War Crimes Committee and Joint Head of Chambers at London-based Guernica 37.\n\nCadman says the solution is for Russia to cease all military operations and return full control of the Zaporizhzhia plant to Ukraine a requirement, he says, under international humanitarian law, which prohibits attacks against civilian targets and requires particular care around nuclear power stations.\n\nThe international community has been urging Russia to create a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia facility. UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres issued a statement in early September calling for the withdrawal of all military personnel from the plant and stating that an urgent agreement is needed at a technical level on a safe perimeter of demilitarisation to ensure the safety of the area.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has given support to these proposals. Russia has not responded directly to the proposal for a demilitarised zone.\n\nSince the beginning of Russias invasion of Ukraine and given the Russian governments repeated threats to use all means at its disposal to protect Russian interests against anyone who would endeavour to interfere, fears of a possible nuclear conflict have been raised to a level not experienced since the post-Cold War era began, explains Cadman. The possibility of a military conflict between Russia and NATO forces has indeed intensified risks of the deployment of nuclear weapons, he says.\n\nRussian nuclear doctrine stipulates that nuclear weapons can be deployed in response to an attack with weapons of mass destruction or if a conventional war threatens the very existence of the State. If Russia perceives that an attack is imminent, its possible it could order the deployment of such weapons.\n\nCadman says that Russian President Vladimir Putins threats are a violation of Article II of the 1973 bilateral Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War, by which the US and Russia pledged to refrain from the threat or use of force against the other Party, against the allies of the other Party and against other countries, in circumstances which may endanger international peace and security.\n\nThe tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which took place throughout August, concluded without reaching agreement on substantive conclusions and recommendations due to Russias opposition to a summary document presented by the Conferences presidency. In particular, Russia objected to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant, and its delegate suggested other countries had also voiced concerns about the draft outcome document.\n\nSuch a failure defeats every possible hope of maintaining an arms control regime, says Cadman. At such a critical time, despite the general support for the Treaty, there is a lack of leadership and a lack of action in terms of disarmament objectives. Therefore, the risks remain high due to this failure to reach an agreement.\n\nImage credit: Cooling towers of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station near the city Enerhodar, Ukraine. ihorbondarenko/AdobeStock.com",

The mission established a continuous IAEA presence at the site to help ensure nuclear safety and security; it also allowed inspectors to complete vital safeguards activities.

Another local deputy said 65 municipal representatives from St Petersburg, Moscow and several other regions had signed a petition she published on Monday calling for Putin's resignation.",

The deputies' open criticism of Putin is a rare public rebuke, and while their motions are largely symbolic, they nonetheless attest to growing public discontent and opposition to the war (6,7,8). The petition's existence, despite Russia's crackdown on dissent, indicates that Ukraine's counteroffensive successes have emboldened Putin's opponents and left his supporters looking for someone else to blame (7)."

However, this opposition poses significant personal risk due to laws criminalizing anti-war dissent and the dissemination of \"fake news\" on the Ukraine conflict, which could result in heavy prison sentences, reflecting the Kremlin's stringent crackdown on any dissent (2, 4, 5).",

This dissent, a rare occurrence in Russia due to the Kremlin's crackdown on opposition, is reflected in an open letter demanding Putin's resignation, signed by dozens of municipal deputies from Moscow and St. Petersburg (2,4). The deputies risk severe punishment due to laws criminalizing anti-war dissent and the spreading of \"fake news\" about the Ukraine invasion (2,4).

The deputies, along with dozens of elected representatives from Moscow, appealed to the Russian Duma and demanded Putin's resignation, alleging vote rigging in local elections and military failures in Ukraine (2,5). The deputies' actions pose a significant risk, as laws passed after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine prohibit anti-war dissent, with punishments including heavy prison sentences (2,5).\n\nThe dissent in St. Petersburg reflects wider political sentiments in Russia as public criticism of Putin's regime continues despite crackdowns on dissent. Municipal deputies from across Russia have expressed opposition, demanding Putin's resignation due to the damaging impact of his actions on Russia's future (4). The deputies' appeals target not only liberal citizens but also those loyal to the authorities who are starting to doubt the success of the Russian army (5). Their dissent, however, was met with charges of \"discrediting\" the Russian army, indicating the risks associated with public criticism of the regime (7). This growing dissent among elected representatives, despite the risk of severe repercussions, suggests increasing dissatisfaction with Putin's government in the midst of the Ukraine-Russia conflict (3,5,6)."

This dissent is further evidenced by a second municipal council in Moscow's Lomonosovsky district voting on a similar motion for Putin's resignation, indicating that public support for the war in Ukraine might not be universal (4). Public support for Yuferev and others' anti-war stance suggests a potential erosion of support for Putin's actions in Ukraine (1, 4).",

Yuferev, a deputy in St. Petersburg's Smolninskoye Municipal District, has even garnered offers from supporters to pay his fines and legal fees and to help relocate his family to Mexico for safety (1). His call for Putin's resignation is not isolated. Other local deputies, including 65 municipal representatives from St. Petersburg, Moscow, and several other regions, have also signed a petition calling for the same (2). \n\nThis dissent among elected representatives is unusual in Russia, where laws have been enacted that punish those who \"discredit\" the armed forces or spread \"deliberately false information\" about them (2). This growing opposition, coupled with the risk these deputies are willing to take, signifies a changing public opinion against Putin's actions, especially in regard to the war in Ukraine (2,3,4). Further, the support these deputies have received from the public also serves as evidence that the war does not enjoy universal backing (4). Despite this, it remains uncertain how these calls for resignation will practically precipitate Putin's resignation (8). Nonetheless, the public support for these deputies sends a strong message to Putin's powerful opponents that they have backing amongst the Russian populace (8)."

Hyundai agreed to give the agency 108 steering wheel locks to distribute to local Hyundai owners.\n\nLance said there has been another recent rise in Kia and Hyundai thefts. In the past two weeks, there have been 36 car thefts or attempted thefts, a third of them Kia or Hyundai vehicles.\n\nOlder versions of the cars have a vulnerability that allows thieves to break into the steering column and start the vehicles. Teens have been filming themselves breaking into the cars and posting the videos to YouTube and TikTok, prompting a wave of thefts.\n\nHyundai drivers can pick up a steering wheel lock any time between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., seven days a week, at the St. Petersburg Police Department lobby, located at 1301 First Ave. N while supplies last. Proof of Hyundai ownership, such as a vehicle registration, is required.\n\nLance said its important to test the steering wheel locks to make sure theyre working effectively and to lock your car doors.\n\n\"A much smaller percentage of these cars have the windows broken,\" he said. \"Its not a guarantee that they wont break your window, but most of the time they just look for an unlocked door.\"",

                "cc_text": "Conventional wisdom most often depicts the events of 1989 as the failure of socialism. That powerful narrative has served both to discredit alternatives to the capitalism that triumphed and to bestow upon it an aura of legitimacy, which is based not solely on a reading of recent history but on accompanying assumptions about the natural order not least human nature. Capitalism, from this perspective, is the normal state of affairs, socialism the deviation from it. Capitalism, it is said, responds to the nature of \"man\" acquisitiveness, competition, egoism, and the insatiable need for more. Socialism stands in the way of initiative, creativity, and the drive for besting ones neighbors. Going by its nom de guerre, communism, it proposes radical equality in a world of unequals. Therefore, it can be maintained only by the coercive power of an entrenched elite and a repressive state. Once that force is removed and the rulers lose confidence in their right to rule, communism, naturally, falls, and peoples instinctual drives for material accumulation are set free. Markets win out everywhere, even where democracy does not. History, however, is always more complicated and messier than the moral and ideological tales it may be deployed to serve. History is about context, both temporal and spatial; it is sensitive to the conjuncture of personalities, processes, contingencies, and structures that together contribute to the unfolding of events.\n\nTwo Revolutionary Series We can tell the history of the founding and floundering of Soviet-style regimes in Europe and Asia in the second half of the twentieth century not as the inevitable failure of coercive utopian projects but as the story of two series of revolutions. The first series consisted of the Communist-led revolutions during the postWorld War II years, from China to Hungary, that eliminated the former ruling elites and transformed largely rural societies into urban, industrial ones. The second consisted of the anti-Communist revolutions of 1989 that brought down the entrenched party regimes in East Central Europe, and soon after the USSR, that were already long suffering from political sclerosis. We can tell the history of Soviet-style regimes not as the inevitable failure of coercive utopian projects but as the story of two series of revolutions. What in the second half of the 1940s would become \"actually existing socialism\" had itself been established at a particular moment, at the beginning of the Cold War struggle between a significantly weaker Soviet Union in the grip of senescent Stalinism and an enormously wealthy, nuclear-armed United States. Forty years later, Communism fell when political crises, economic stagnation (not collapse), and a will to change the way that the system worked combined during a particular historical conjuncture. To the lasting dismay of democratic socialists, those revolutions occurred in the era of Thatcherite/Reaganite neoliberalism, vigorous anti-Communism, and muscular military and covert interventions against the Left and radical movements in all parts of the globe. The figure of Mikhail Gorbachev (19312022) is central to the story of the end of Communism and the failure of a middle road between state-centered \"socialism\" and neoliberal capitalism. His aspirations and achievements, positive and negative, have been the subject of dozens of books and hundreds of articles, both scholarly and polemical. With his death on August 30, 2022, reflections and assessments of Gorbachevs pivotal historical role have divided public opinion both in the West and East. Largely applauded in the West and despised in his own country, Gorbachevs life, like that of Vladimir Lenin nearly a century before, fundamentally shaped the history not only of socialism but of capitalism, democracy, and the international security system well into the next century.\n\nFrom Peasant to President Americans pride themselves that many of their presidents were born in log cabins at least they once did. A recurring image that reinforces the dream of upward mobility, it is linked to faith in a market capitalism ostensibly founded on principles of equality of opportunity and the promises of bourgeois democracy. Mikhail Gorbachev rose from southern Russian peasants and never lost his sense of self as a man of the people. Few in the \"Free World\" notice that among the leaders of the Soviet Union, after the short tenure of the nobleman Lenin probably the greatest class traitor in history all the successive top guns in the party hierarchy were plebeians. Joseph Stalin, by official rank a peasant, was the son of a shoemaker and a seamstress; Nikita Khrushchevs parents were peasants, and he started out as a metalworker; and Leonid Brezhnev was, in his own words, a hereditary proletarian. Mikhail Gorbachev rose from southern Russian peasants and never lost his sense of self as a man of the people, not to mention his villagers accent. From an early age, little Misha knew the brutalities of Stalinism and war. Both his grandfathers one the chairman of a collective farm, the other an individualistic farmer spent time in the gulag. Young Gorbachev was shunned by his playmates, and his biographer, William Taubman, speculates that such experiences gave Mikhail a balanced view of the Soviet experiment and a keen understanding of the injustices of the system. An exceptionally hard worker, physically strong, and intellectually curious, he worked the fields during the German occupation of World War II. The experience of what he and his father had lived through affected his future reluctance to use violence when he had the power to do so. Through native intelligence and ambition, he advanced steadily up the party ladder to become the last general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In a country without the rule of law, he was able to grow from provincial peasant to student of law at the most prestigious university in the Soviet Union, Moscow State. Even before meeting his more sophisticated, urbane wife, Raisa, the rawboned youth already had doubts about many Soviet practices. Throughout, however, he remained faithful to the aspirations of Leninism. Gorbachev imbibed the values of Soviet-style socialism. He was fundamentally egalitarian and eschewed the privileges of wealth and position. He despised what he considered bourgeois. And he was a fervent Soviet patriot. Gorbachev was \"a true believer,\" writes Taubman, \"not in the Soviet system as it functioned (or didnt) in 1985 but in its potential to live up to what he deemed its original ideals. Gorbachev believed in socialism, the faith of his beloved father and grandfather.\" After all, it was the Soviet system, the socialist affirmative-action program that promoted workers and peasants upward, that made what he became possible. Gorbachev was skilled, charming, or lucky enough to attract important patrons, most consequently Yuri Andropov. But luck and fateful accidents played as great a role in his spectacular rise as did his natural talents. In the Soviet Union, whom you knew and who could do you favors and promote you were keys to advancement certainly more than birth or wealth, as in much of the West. Gorbachev was skilled, charming, or lucky enough to attract important patrons, most consequently Yuri Andropov, whom he met when the one-time KGB chief and later general secretary vacationed in Stavropol province where Gorbachev headed the party. Thanks to his connections, he was called to Moscow in 1978 to become the youngest Central Committee secretary. Seven years later, after the death of three aged first secretaries in succession, his desperate comrades banked on his comparative youth (fifty-four) and chose him to be leader of the Soviet Union.\n\nPerestroika and Glasnost In his new, powerful post of general secretary, Gorbachev embarked, at first cautiously, on an evolutionary, gradualist \"revolution,\" intending to build a more democratic socialism. The Soviet leader was extraordinarily confident in his abilities and the potential of the sclerotic Soviet system to regenerate itself along the lines laid out by Lenin, Gorbachevs deified hero. He set out on a program of political democratization, economic liberalization, decentralization of control of non-Russian republics, emancipation of Soviet satellites, nuclear disarmament, and putting an end to the costly Cold War all at once and as rapidly as possible. One wonders whether any state or society, anywhere in the world, could have multitasked at such an ambitious and ill-planned transformation and survived, let along the stagnating, overly bureaucratized, and geriatric Soviet state. Just as he embarked on his radical perestroika (restructuring) of the largest country in the world, fortune seemed to abandon the determined reformer. The first great shock, after an ill-fated and unpopular prohibition campaign, was the explosion of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, which was followed by a devastating earthquake in Armenia, and the steady decline in the Soviet economy. World oil and gas prices fell, reducing the major sources of foreign exchange. The deep rot in the system was exposed more glaringly than ever. The impulse to reform, as in much of Russias history, had come from the top, not from society. He opened up the public sphere and allowed free expression (glasnost) to tap into the latent energies of ordinary people and attract the Soviet intelligentsia to his side. Intellectuals griped, and once Gorbachev ended censorship, the howls from writers and journalists grew louder and helped to erode support for the regime. Although he never clamped down on the freedom of the press that he had initiated, perhaps Gorbachev lamented, as had the writer Maxim Gorky, that \"artists are irresponsible people,\" or as Lenin put it more angrily in a letter to Gorky, \"the educated classes . . . consider themselves the brains of the nation. In fact, they are not its brains but its shit.\" The impulse to reform, as in much of Russias history, had come from the top, not from society. When ordinary people became fed up with the irresponsible exploitation by a regime, they turned to revolution. But there was no upsurge from the bottom, no great popular expression of discontent at first from workers and peasants. Most party apparatchiki resisted reforms, though others were willing to go along if they occurred gradually and if they were controlled from above. The possibility of changing the system in the late Soviet Union could only come from the regime itself, for control by the state, party, police, and army was secure. Dissent had largely been channeled or crushed in the Brezhnev and Andropov years, and most party and state officials were quite comfortable in their privileged positions. Gorbachevs mentor Andropov had warned that freedom could get out of hand, but his pupil turned out to be less risk averse. Gorbachev was faced with a dilemma: he needed the Communist Party to transform the system, but the party was reluctant or opposed to radical change. To carry out his revolution, the general secretary decided to weaken the party and mobilize society. He undermined the influence and power of the party bosses and by doing so eroded his own power. Gorbachev wanted to be simultaneously pope and Martin Luther, to preserve much of the system but change it without destroying it. Gorbachev wanted to be simultaneously pope and Martin Luther, to preserve much of the system but change it without destroying it. Or as Taubman puts it, \"It was as if the tsar had turned Bolshevik and decided to overturn his own regime.\" Occupying the center of the political system, he alienated both the conservatives on the Right and the liberals and radicals on the Left. By opening up the public sphere and permitting free expression, he created the possibility for mass politics that his greatest nemesis, the ambitious, impulsive radical, Boris Yeltsin, exploited to his advantage. Taubman argues, in my view correctly, that \"Gorbachev was instinctively democratic, Yeltsin an authoritarian populist.\"\n\nEastern Europe Eastern Europe was where both world wars and the Cold War began: the fragmented frontier zone between developed industrial capitalism and its agrarian poor relation, still largely peasant, traditionally religious, and fiercely nationalist. One can also argue that it was in this zone of imperial conflict that the disintegration of the USSR began. Whatever enthusiasm for the Soviet Armys liberation of the region from fascism had existed in the mid-1940s, it had largely dissipated over the four decades of \"actually existing socialism\" and Soviet hegemony. Eastern Europe was not a particularly hospitable place for socialist revolution as Karl Marx envisaged it. Eastern Europe was not a particularly hospitable place for socialist revolution as Karl Marx envisaged it especially when that revolution was associated with Russia, the Great Power most resented by Poles, Germans, Hungarians, and Romanians. The \"East European Revolutions\" of the 1940s and 1950s were largely, though not entirely, the imposition of the Kremlin, and the system eventually built was modeled after the most draconian variant of what has been called \"socialism,\" namely the Stalinist command economy and police state. I do not agree with the characterization of the Soviet sphere of influence in the region as an empire, which in my usage requires imperial control of both domestic and foreign policy. It is more useful to define Moscows control over the countries of the Soviet bloc in the period following Stalins death as \"hegemony,\" which involves dominance and coordination in foreign policy as well as some degree of interference in internal affairs to ensure conformity with the interests of the hegemon. To various degrees after 1953, the countries in East Central Europe were able to shape their domestic policies and structures somewhat independently of the Kremlins proscriptions. But Moscow interfered and even intervened militarily to prevent the defection of these countries from the coordination of their foreign policies. After the World War II, Stalins USSR slowly recovered from its massively costly victory over fascism, in which an estimated 27 million Soviet citizens had died. The dictator was suspicious of the intentions of its former allies the United States and Great Britain and was determined to hold on to the fruits of war up to Central Germany. Realists in both the East and West understood that the question of which side would dominate Eastern Europe was a foregone conclusion, given military realities and Soviet notions of security. As historian Norman Naimark has shown, the real question was not whether but how Stalin would control those \"liberated\" countries. Would they become allied but autonomous states, like Finland, or end up with fully Stalinized and Soviet-manipulated police regimes?\n\nRevolution From Above At first, the Soviets promoted coalition governments and gradual social transitions. The prewar elites had been discredited by their collaboration with the Nazis, and the politics of most of Eastern Europe gravitated leftward. Russians were popular as liberators, and Communists had significant support in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. There was enthusiasm for some of their imposed social changes. In Hungary, Poland, and Romania, land reforms favoring the peasants turned over hundreds of thousands of acres. Industry owned by Germans was nationalized in Czechoslovakia and Poland. But four of the countries taken by the Soviet army had been part of the Axis Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria and they were drained of resources, which the Soviets demanded as reparations for their colossal losses in the war. Kremlin leaders believed that the security of the USSR and the transformation of the countries on its western border went hand in hand. As in the Soviet Union, so in Eastern Europe, Communists were brutal modernizers. Kremlin leaders believed that the security of the USSR and the transformation of the countries on its western border from agrarian to industrial, peasant to proletarian, went hand in hand. By the last years of Stalins life, any deviance from the strict Soviet form of \"revolution from above\" led variously to expulsion from the Communist bloc, as in the case of Josip Broz Titos Yugoslavia; the purging of dissenters; or even the execution of veteran party leaders like Lszl Rajk in Hungary, Traicho Kostov in Bulgaria, and Rudolf Slnsk in Czechoslovakia. If socialism was as fatally flawed as the \"inevitablists,\" who believe its fall was foreordained, claim, it would not have lasted as long as it did, historian Constantine Pleshakov argues. These regimes not only survived for forty years but were relatively stable and even enjoyed a degree of popular backing. While no Communist state could be maintained without the secret police, there was at the same time a social contract between the rulers and the ruled that delivered goods and services to the people: free health care, free housing, and free education. The Communists carried out social revolutions in the region. They not only took land from the aristocracy and the church but also secularized education, provided jobs in new industries, and made life and livelihood more secure and predictable. They redrew the borders of the countries they occupied, returning Transylvania to Romania, and creating a new Poland territorially by annexing German lands to make up for the loss of the prewar Polish states eastern part that Stalin had incorporated into the Soviet Union. They abetted the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Germans from Poland and Czechoslovakia and guaranteed the independent existence of the German Democratic Republic. Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, and Poles were not happy with the loss of territory ceded to the USSR and Romania, but the presence of the Soviet Army, along with the internationalist rhetoric of Marxism-Leninism, at least prevented the worst excesses of ethnic nationalism that had so often and so recently plagued the region. Jews, who had been subject to discrimination and ghettoization in the interwar years and mass murder by the Nazis and their East European fascist allies, were now protected, and many rose to power as Stalinist loyalists, although there were spasmodic periods of antisemitic discrimination. Economies grew in the years after Stalins death; energy was cheap, subsidized by Soviet exports; and East Europeans in general lived better in the periphery of empire than most Russians did in its metropole. As Pleshakov puts it: \"Equating bread with freedom thats what made communism appealing after the war.\"\n\nFrom Goulash Communism to Shock Therapy The dangerous Cold War competition between East and West was finally settled, not by ideological appeals or nuclear weapons, but by the most mundane material factors. The economies of the Soviet bloc, themselves eager to incessantly increase output, were ultimately outperformed by the West. Nowhere was this contrast more evident than in Berlin where the frenetic illumination of the western sector outshone the more subdued lights of the east. Communists had promised not only social justice and equality but greater prosperity and productivity than was possible under capitalism. Communists had promised not only social justice and equality but greater prosperity and productivity than was possible under capitalism. Soviet-style economies proved unable to compete successfully. More ominous, they fell under the dominance of Western bankers, dependent on huge loans with all the consequences of soaring debt. The social contract trapped the socialist states: they could neither cut the subsidies that kept consumer prices low nor use the capitalist weapon of unemployment to restructure their economies. Chinas \"market Leninism\" offered one way out a turn toward capitalism without democratization but East European Communists hesitated to go that far until it was too late. Economic and social discontent led to attempts at revolution, first in 1956 in Hungary, then in 1968 in Czechoslovakia, and calls for a more democratic, participatory society perhaps another kind of socialism. The Soviets loosened control, made concessions, and allowed a kind of \"vegetarian\" communism or (for the carnivores) \"goulash communism\" more goods, some travel abroad, less repression, but only the most muted voice in politics. By the early 1970s, the regimes looked stable, relatively prosperous, and likely to be around a long time. However, in order to maintain the social contract, money had to be borrowed from the West. The debt owed to foreign banks grew, and a cycle of falling productivity and growing discontent accelerated, most massively in the Polish strike movements of 1970, 1976, and 1980 that eventually forced the government to permit the formation of an independent trade union, Solidarity. But then, in the minds of dissidents, a miracle happened. A genuine democrat and determined reformer, Mikhail Gorbachev, was given the most powerful position in the Soviet bloc. Gorbachevs greatest gift to the USSRs satellite states was to return sovereignty to them and pledge not to interfere in their affairs. To the dismay of hard-liners like Erich Honecker in East Germany, the Soviets refused to back up their former clients when they were faced by popular protests. When the Hungarian Communists decided to open their borders in 1989 and allow East Germans to cross to the West, they set off an avalanche of dominos that led within months to the fall of the Berlin Wall. The stark symbol of the Cold War and of self-styled socialism came down and with it the division of Germany. For many in Russia, the security they had gained from their advances westward in 1945 disappeared in the rubble. Within months of the breaching of the Berlin Wall, the question of the survival of the Warsaw Pact and of NATO competed for resolution with efforts to unite the two German states. At the end of the 1980s and in the early 1990s, the East Europeans moved quickly, with a normative confidence in the unavoidability of capitalism, to market economies. Communism, they concluded, was unredeemable. \"Socialism with a human face\" was utopian, they had come to believe. In the words of the Polish oppositionist Adam Michnik, it was simply \"totalitarianism with its teeth knocked out.\" Gorbachev, however, fumbled between opening up markets and prices and rejecting full privatization and marketization. His trajectory headed toward a tragic failure of his democratic dreams.\n\nReform and Revolution Reform and revolution are not so much opposites as points on a continuum of political change. The difference is about tempo and degree of change: the faster and more radical the change, the closer to revolution; the slower and more moderate the change, the closer to reform. Over time, reform can turn into revolution and vice versa. Reform might occur so rapidly or go so far as to transform completely a regime and therefore can justifiably be labeled a revolution. Gorbachev called his perestroika a \"revolution,\" even though he did not anticipate the loss of power by the party he headed. As the denouement of the drama of 1989 took place in Eastern Europe, that year in the USSR was still one of reform rapidly moving into revolution. Social order and political authority sharply eroded from 1989. Conflict broke out between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in February, and the elections of May, fostered by Gorbachev, were the freest that Russia had experienced since 1917. Gorbachevs promotion of elected bodies shifted power from the Communist Party to broad parliamentary institutions. Gorbachevs promotion of elected bodies the Congress of Peoples Deputies and later elected soviets shifted power from the Communist Party to broad parliamentary institutions. Hard-liners in the Communist Party were stunned, and liberals and more radical reformers surged to prominence in the now-open politics. Political life moved from the opaque offices of high party officials into the televised give-and-take of unscripted debates. As Vladislav M. Zubok eloquently summarized it, \"The Congress made political power transparent and electable, and thus destroyed its mystery.\" Fear changed sides; ordinary people were no longer afraid of the state, the party, or the KGB, and members of the nomenklatura now feared those whom Gorbachev had unleashed. The Soviet Union lasted two more years, but the Communist system of a single governing party and a command economy, all operating under strict censorship, was already gone. What had once been an ironclad freighter labeled \"totalitarianism\" was daily being replaced by a jerry-built ship at sea, hardly seaworthy and already floundering in the turbulent waters of economic crisis. In the USSR, the essence of the political system a one-party state and the command economy had been taken apart two years before the union disintegrated into fifteen separate states. As British political scientist Archie Brown concluded, \"From the spring of 1989 it is scarcely meaningful to describe the Soviet Union as a communist system.\"\n\nA Crisis of Confidence Gorbachev intended to eliminate the top-down command system and introduce greater democracy, but he wanted neither the end of socialism which he defined as dependent on and requiring democracy nor that of the USSR. Gorbachev and his closest associates did not seem to have a clear idea what socialism would entail, other than liberating the pent-up energies of ordinary people. Gorbachev did not seem to have a clear idea what socialism would entail, other than liberating the pent-up energies of ordinary people. He had a lingering Leninist aversion to private property and spoke about combining state property with cooperatives. As late as July 1991, he managed, despite their hostility and indifference to his ideas, to have his party comrades support the idea of \"democratic socialism\" something akin to social democracy of the West European type. The Achilles heel of the reform program was the economy, and here Gorbachev was out of his depth. He depended on Soviet economists who had limited knowledge of how the Soviet system worked and were bitterly divided about how to reform it. While those closest to Gorbachev opted for slower, more limited reforms, those who gravitated to Yeltsin were prepared to eliminate state controls entirely. They wanted to adopt radical reforms along the lines of the pro-market, neoliberal \"Washington Consensus\" and were even enchanted by the perceived successes of the dictatorial Augusto Pinochet regime in Chile that Milton Friedmans \"Chicago Boys\" had promoted. Young Yeltsinist economists like Yegor Gaidar were convinced that macroeconomic laws were irrefutable and applied universally: radical marketization and the end of price controls were essential. High on Gaidars agenda was the destruction of the last \"totalitarian\" empire, the USSR. As Zubok observes, \"The Soviet leader also suffered from an accumulating crisis of confidence. His long-winded explanations, in contrast to Yeltsins more succinct populist style, no longer appealed to the majority who felt cheated and disillusioned.\" Gorbachev pleaded in vain for the Americans to bail him out. However, the West ultimately did not deliver the material aid that was so desperately needed. Moscow was on its own. Relying on good faith, his exalted charisma in the West, and friendship with key world leaders, Gorbachev never fully appreciated that international politics really is a self-help game. He would have failed a freshman exam in realist international relations theory. After Gorbachev had successfully reformed the Soviet system out of existence and enabled the precipitous rejection of party rule in Eastern Europe, that example of decolonization became a powerful incentive, first to dissident nationalists in Armenia, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and later to Communists in the non-Russian republics, to strike out on their own and declare sovereignty or independence. Even the old Communist Yeltsin discovered nationalism: after repeatedly defending the unity of the Soviet Union, he encouraged non-Russians both inside and outside the Russian Republic to take as much power as they were able. Along with the ethnic conflicts in the Baltic republics and the South Caucasus, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the defection of East European states from Communist rule, Gorbachev was soon overwhelmed by cascading trends and events: disastrous economic collapse, massive public protests, miners strikes, and deepening divisions within the elites desperately trying to hold onto on some semblance of power. Still, he refused to use the armed muscle he had in his hands. Reluctant to deploy the police and the military, even when faced by riots and rebellion, Gorbachev also feared the reaction from the Western governments whose aid and support he needed.\n\nTug-of-war In the last few years of Soviet power, despite calls from both hard-liners in the Communist Party and more liberal supporters for Gorbachev to establish stronger presidential power, even a dictatorship, he was extremely reluctant to use coercion against recalcitrant and rebellious Soviet citizens. Only on a few occasions, in the Baltic and Caucasian republics, did he sanction a crackdown. Gorbachev was extremely reluctant to use coercion against recalcitrant and rebellious Soviet citizens. Even then, the use of the state security forces was intermittent, hesitant, and usually followed by concessions or apologies. Like a parent who shifts from strict enforcement of the rules to tolerating mischievous behavior, he resurrected images both of repressive Communism and political weakness. Revolutions are almost always accompanied by violence and often followed by civil wars. Lenin unhesitatingly called for civil war when he was struggling for power. Terror was one of his tools for state-building. Gorbachevs successor, Yeltsin, proved to be far less reluctant to use force, comfortably speaking from the top of a tank or sending his army to quell his political opponents in Moscow or rebel separatists in Chechnya. But Gorbachev, it turned out, did not have the \"iron teeth\" that Andrei Gromyko, in nominating him to the highest post in the land, had promised he would show. \"The majority of Russians,\" Zubok writes, \"wanted Gorbachev to use his power, not to devolve it; and Gorbachevs reluctance to use that power appeared to many as weakness.\" Rather than embracing grassroots nationalism and a desire for independence, most people in the Soviet Union wanted order, security, a strong government, and greater prosperity. Once the government of Gorbachev and the Communist Party wavered and appeared unable to deliver, popular affection shifted to the democratic movements and the efforts of republican elites to achieve sovereignty and eventually independence. As late as March 1991, there was much greater enthusiasm for a single, unitary state the USSR than for independence. A referendum on the future shape of the USSR won a majority of over 75 percent in favor of preserving some form of union. But in the words of Zubok, \"the vacuum of central power,\" the failure to adopt effective economic reforms, the massive disaffection from the \"socialist choice,\" and the abortive coup against Gorbachev of August 1991 doomed perestroika. As he concludes, the Soviet Union \"was dismantled and dismembered largely by the internal tug-of-war.\"\n\nA Post-Soviet World Gorbachev had more in mind than just reforming the USSR. He elaborated plans for a new international system that would unite East and West and end the threat of nuclear annihilation. The Soviet leader spoke of a \"common European home\" extending from the Atlantic to the Urals and perhaps beyond. As the Soviet economy disintegrated in the chaos of market reforms, Moscows bargaining power with the West diminished. As the Soviet economy disintegrated in the chaos of market reforms, Moscows bargaining power with the West diminished, for the Soviets desperately needed financial aid from Europe and the United States. George H. W. Bushs national security team wanted to preserve the NATO alliance, with a united Germany within it and with nuclear weapons stationed on its soil. As Zubok puts it, \"The White House wanted to keep intact all structures that would allow the United States to continue waging the Cold War if necessary.\" Some in the Bush administration frankly admitted that the interest of the United States was to turn the Soviet Union into a \"third-rate power.\" At their shipboard meeting in Malta in early December 1989, a few weeks after the dramatic fall of the Berlin Wall, Bush pressured the Soviet leader to cease his assistance to Fidel Castros Cuba and to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Surprised by these demands, Gorbachev used the occasion to deal with the German question. He suggested that Germany be neutral or nuclear free, but Bushs secretary of state James Baker suggested that the two states be joined with a guarantee that NATO would not \"shift one inch eastward from its present position.\" Gorbachev eventually gave in but asserted that any expansion of \"the zone of NATO\" was not acceptable. And according to Gorbachev, Baker answered, \"We agree with that.\" Soon after, West German chancellor Helmut Kohl and his foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher reiterated the promise that \"NATO will not extend itself to the East.\" To the amazement of many in his foreign policy team, Gorbachev conceded that the question of unification should be decided by the German people themselves. He later went further and agreed, as stipulated in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, that every state could choose whichever alliance it wanted to join. Gorbachev continued to call for limitations on or even the elimination of nuclear arms, which in the fatal calculus of power at that moment of decline was the most important asset the Soviets still possessed. To his critics, the general secretary had essentially given away a major prize of the Soviet victory in 1945 that is, the division of its major European adversary, Germany without any significant concessions or guarantees from the West other than verbal promises. One Soviet official confided to his diary, \"This carelessness will take its revenge on us.\" Yet what was clearly a loss for the Soviet Union was a colossal gain for other states most immediately for the members of the Warsaw Pact, which enhanced their sovereignty, and later for republics of the USSR, which became full subjects in the international system.\n\nDecline The international order was once again being rejiggered by the Great Powers, but the leverage of one of them, the USSR, was declining rapidly. Gorbachev was unable to stem the growing economic collapse of his country. Western banks cut the USSR from international money markets and desperately needed credit since it was no longer clear who would repay the loans: republics or the central state? Miners in Kuzbass and Donbas went on strike demanding some relief from perpetual deficits. Most threatening were the ethnic clashes that tore at the fragile fabric of druzhba narodov (\"friendship of the peoples\") in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Non-Russian Soviet republics, beginning with Lithuania, were demanding independence from the union, and Gorbachevs major rival, Yeltsin, grew increasingly popular as he exploited the indigestible freedoms that Gorbachev had implemented. In the new politics of openness, with elections determining power, Yeltsin outperformed his nominal boss. Gorbachev would live long enough to see the opportunity to reshape the international order squandered and a new cold war turn into a hot war in Ukraine. Gorbachev repeatedly reminded the Western leaders of how his reforms and policies had ended the Cold War and spread democracy, and he pleaded with Bush not to take advantage of Soviet weakness and assert world dominance. The world should emerge multipolar, he argued, not unipolar with a single hegemonic superpower. Gorbachev would live long enough to see the opportunity to reshape the international order squandered and a new cold war turn into a hot war in Ukraine. Several East Central European governments were eager to join NATO, and there was talk of making some arrangement between NATO and the USSR. Gorbachev favored bringing his state into the alliance, but the Americans generally considered this proposal a fantasy. As Bush told the French leader Franois Mitterrand: \"It is difficult to visualize how a European collective security arrangement including Eastern Europe, and perhaps even the Soviet Union, could have the capability to deter threats to Western Europe.\" The Soviets offered the East Europeans an arrangement that would have essentially Finlandized those countries in other words, coordinated their foreign policies with the interests determined by the USSR. The offer was rejected by now-independent governments. Three decades later, Vladimir Putin made a quite similar offer to Ukraine, which was likewise rejected by Kyiv. Chancellor Kohls party allies won an overwhelming victory in East German elections in March 1990. With all the cards in his hand, Kohl made it clear to both Gorbachev and his own free-floating foreign minister, Genscher, that he was committed to Germany staying in NATO and willing to pay dearly in aid to the Soviets for this choice. The Americans were much more hesitant about largesse to the USSR but were enthusiastic about Eastern Europeans joining NATO. Gorbachev believed that with Germany in NATO, the Cold War division of Europe would be recemented and \"it [would] be too late to create a credible security structure in Europe.\" Secretary of State Baker told him that the idea of a pan-European security structure was \"an excellent dream, but only a dream.\" Increasingly it became clear that NATO was to remain the cornerstone of European security with its primary adversary, the USSR (soon to be the Russian Federation), outside. On October 3, 1990, Germany was reunited as a powerful state within NATO. Two months later, Gorbachev accepted the Nobel Peace Prize. Soviet troops withdrew gradually from Germany and the rest of East Central Europe; American troops and weapons remained. \"The alliance had started its postCold War expansion to the east,\" as Mary Sarotte writes.\n\nA Fatal Flaw The end of the Cold War meant the movement of East Central European countries, one by one, out from under Soviet economic, political, and military dominance toward adoption of Western democratic and capitalist formations. The pull and power of the West was irresistible and the fear of Russia too great. Whatever good intentions Gorbachev had or conciliatory actions he took for example, signing the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty of 1990 the relative weakness of the USSR undermined his alternatives, such as pan-European security structures or reliance on the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Bush was determined to resist Iraqi leader Saddam Husseins invasion of Kuwait and rebuffed Gorbachevs efforts to negotiate a solution. The Soviet special envoy to Iraq, Yevgeny Primakov, had convinced Hussein to withdraw his troops, but despite Gorbachevs pleading, Bush went ahead with the invasion. It is estimated that somewhere between 60,000 and 200,000 Iraqis were killed while fewer than 150 Allied soldiers died. The United States had rejected Gorbachevs requests for aid but found $100 billion to pursue the war in Iraq. Humiliated by the Americans, Gorbachev was seen by his own military leaders as weak and distracted. Humiliated by the Americans, Gorbachev was seen by his own military leaders as weak and distracted. They were distancing themselves from their commander-in-chief and engaging in their own maneuvers around the CFE Treaty, and they would eventually join the plot in August 1991 to overthrow Gorbachev. The Bush administration feigned that financial support might come with further reforms but preferred to aid the East Europeans rather than the Soviets. As plotters planned their coup against Gorbachev, Bush entertained his principal opponent, the recently elected president of the Russian Soviet Republic, Yeltsin, at his home in Texas. Yeltsin, who worked consistently to undermine Gorbachev, effectively imperiling the union, promised that Russia would destroy the Soviet command economy and rely on markets. In fact, Russia was by this stage not turning tax revenues over to the Soviet center, effectively defunding the government of the union. A sober account of the Soviet predicament was given behind closed doors in Moscow by Gorbachevs KGB chief, Vladimir Kryuchkov, in the absence of his boss: the USSR was becoming dependent on the United States, which was demanding lethal concessions that were exclusively in the Wests interests. Indeed, Bush told Gorbachev in July 1991, \"If you still feel that a rapid transition to the market is too risky . . . then we will find it harder to help you.\" As Zubok notes, rather than facilitate the transformation of the Soviet Union into a Western-style democratic capitalist state with Marshall Plansize loans, Washington \"continued to pursue the short-term vision of locking in the Cold War gains.\" Yet the Bush administration did not favor the breakup of the Soviet Union, which would result in the unpredictable expansion of new states with which it would have to deal (three of them armed with nuclear weapons). The president expressed this view in his unfairly maligned \"Chicken Kiev\" speech in early August 1991. Still, with Gorbachev attending the G-7 summit just before that, Bush rejected all the suggestions of his European allies to soften the economic transition in the Soviet Union. The neoliberal Washington Consensus had to be accepted unconditionally. Soon afterward, Yeltsin emerged as a hero defending democracy against the coup that held Gorbachev captive for three days. He was supported by tens of thousands of ordinary citizens who stood guard around Russias parliament, the White House, and rallied massively in Leningrad in front of the Winter Palace to prevent an assault by the army and the KGB. When the Soviet president returned to Moscow, Yeltsin effectively carried out his own countercoup against Gorbachev, reducing him to a figurehead and engineering Russias exit from the USSR. Personal enmity between Gorbachev and Yeltsin and the Russian presidents ambition to become the key player in what would be left of his country were the immediate contingent factors that destroyed the USSR. But as the British ambassador to Moscow Rodric Braithwaite remarked later about Gorbachev, \"Exasperation at his endless talk, and his absolute failure to act, in the end destroyed what popular support he had left.\" For his part, Bushs national security advisor, Brent Scowcroft, mused: For all his brilliance, Gorbachev appeared to have a fatal flaw. He seemed unable to make tough decisions and stick with them. . . . Had Gorbachev possessed the authoritarian and Stalin-like political will and the determination of his predecessors, we might be still facing the Soviet Union.\n\n\"The Most Revolutionary Event\" Under pressure from Yeltsin and in his weakened position, Gorbachev reluctantly abolished most of the Soviet institutions, including the CPSU, the base of his own power and the apparatus that constituted the last sinews holding together the USSR. \"Gorbachev was a bizarre political animal,\" Zubok notes, paraphrasing one of Yeltsins advisers, \"who misunderstood power.\" The postCold War settlement reinforced American dominance, not only in Europe but globally. Gorbachev struggled for the next three months, from September to December 1991, to hold together what was left of the country he headed. However, Yeltsin and the other leaders of Soviet republics, most importantly Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, stealthily undermined his authority and usurped one institution after another. On December 1, Ukrainians, who had voted in March to preserve the Soviet Union by a huge majority, now voted overwhelmingly (90 percent) for independence. The die had been cast. The end of the Soviet system, followed by the disintegration of the Soviet Union, exposed a major problem for independent Russia and its most populous neighbor, Ukraine. The Soviet Empire ultimately disintegrated, not from a popular, massive uprising from below, as many in the West imagine, but from a meeting of three inebriated leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus in a forest setting where they conspired its demise. The Soviet world ended, in a phrase once coined by T. S. Elliot, \"not with a bang but a whimper.\" The US ambassador to the USSR at the time, Bushs personal friend Robert Strauss, sent a prescient warning to Washington: The most revolutionary event of 1991 for Russia may not be the collapse of Communism, but something that Russians of all political stripes think of as part of their own body politic, and near to the heart at that: Ukraine. The postCold War settlement reinforced American dominance, not only in Europe but globally. While the Russian economy collapsed, impoverishing most of its people, the US economy embarked on a period of expanding prosperity. In Russia, cronies of the state enriched themselves buying up the assets of the Soviet command system. Yeltsin aided and was aided by a new post-Soviet bourgeoisie led by oligarchs who benefited from their closeness to the government. Bushs successor, Bill Clinton, established an unusual personal relationship with the Russian president, explaining that his commitment to democracy and good relations with the West made Yeltsin, drunk or sober, the best Russian leader America could hope for. In October 1993, Yeltsin carried out another coup, this time a violent one against his own elected parliament. By December, he had established a new strong presidency with himself in charge. The US government and many American scholars and pundits, liberals as well as conservatives, supported Yeltsin as the best bet against the coming to power of the post-Soviet Russian Communist Party, now led by right-wing nationalists, in the 1996 presidential election. Eastern Europeans worried that an unstable Russia would endanger them and continually pressured President Clinton for their admission to NATO.\n\nKennan as Cassandra A Pentagon strategy memo stated that the aim of the United States was \"to ensure that no rival superpower is allowed to emerge.\" Clinton pressured Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons while agreeing to extend NATO eastward. The Russians were increasingly frustrated by Clintons interest in NATO enlargement and the alliances military interventions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Serbia. However, Moscow was too weak to do much more than protest. At dinner with the Polish president Lech Wasa, Yeltsin inadvertently said that he did not object to Poland joining NATO, and he withdrew the last Soviet troops from Poland. In late 1994, Yeltsin launched a fierce campaign against the breakaway region of Chechnya, the images from which only confirmed the view of many in the West and Eastern Europe that Russias erratic and brutal warfare presented a military threat to their security. That unsuccessful effort actually revealed how weak the Russian armed forces had become and how fragile the relations were between Moscow and the regions. George F. Kennan predicted that NATO expansion would prove to be the most fateful error of American policy in the postCold War era. A key adviser to Clinton, Madeleine Albright, soon to become secretary of state, described the key issue for the United States as managing Russias \"devolution from an imperial to a normal nation.\" The president believed that NATO could move eastward and Russia could be bought off with economic aid as its economy foundered. In December, the Clinton security team opted secretly for moving ahead on bringing a select few East European states into NATO. The president said he was convinced that \"here we have the first chance ever since the rise of the nation-state to have the entire continent of Europe live in peace.\" The father of \"containment\" during the Cold War, George F. Kennan, predicted that NATO expansion would prove to be \"the most fateful error of American policy in the postCold War era.\" Other former US policymakers such as Robert McNamara, Paul Nitze, and Scowcroft issued similar warnings but in vain. In May 1997, the United States and Russia signed an agreement that several countries would be admitted to NATO in exchange for aid to Russia. Relations between the two largest nuclear powers quickly soured over the next few years. Mired in a sordid drama stemming from his affair with a White House aide, Clinton actively encouraged NATO to fight against the Serbian president Slobodan Milosevics efforts to keep its Kosovo autonomous region within Serbia. In 1999, NATO bombing raids attacked Belgrade and on one occasion accidently bombed the Chinese embassy. Yeltsin and his prime minister, Primakov, were furious at US disregard of Russias close alliance with Serbia. A lasting enmity was developing over Washingtons engagement in the Balkans. One of the results of NATOs new positions, geographically and strategically, was the end of arms control efforts. Another was the elimination of any constraint on the temptation to extend NATO even further eastward. The Visegrd Group Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia joined in 1999. The Baltic states were admitted alongside Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in 2004, followed by Albania and Croatia in 2009. More ominous, other states on the borders of Russia, Ukraine and Georgia, were promised potential membership, though no clear steps were taken to assure their entry. In a compelling analysis, Tony Wood sums up the process at work: \"The main reason NATO expansion could gather such momentum was precisely because Russia was not a threat.\"\n\nLiberal Hegemony As international relations scholar Richard Sakwa reminds us: The demise of the Soviet Union removed checks on international liberalism, and its radicalisation in the form of the expansive ambitions of liberal hegemony is at the heart of post-1989 international politics. . . . Liberal institutionalism gave way to liberal hegemony. Once Communist universalism had collapsed before its chief competitor, liberal universalism, the post-Soviet present was distinguished from the years of the Cold War in that no serious anti-capitalism existed. As in the period before 1914, dual crises of liberal democracy and liberal internationalism have produced a particularly dangerous world of Great Power rivalry and competitive forms of governance taking place in the context of unbridled and confident capitalism and civilizational imperialism. The United States emerged from World War II more powerful economically and militarily than any other country on the globe (or indeed any imaginable combination of countries). It had willingly constrained its foreign policy independence in the early Cold War years by helping create and agreeing to work within a system of international organizations, which included the United Nations and the Bretton Woods economic order. However, the discrepancy between rhetoric and good intentions, on the one hand, and the inordinate power of the Americans, on the other, made irresistible the temptation to establish an international order that fostered the hegemony of the United States. The Cold War had been won by the West, and a single model of politics and economics had eliminated the alternatives to it, or so things seemed. The world had become unipolar, one dimensional, and in the eyes of many commentators had been returned to the path of civilization. History had ended, it was said, with the triumph of the West. The euphoric optimism about democracy and capitalism generated by the collapse of state socialist regimes was short lived. Yet the euphoric optimism about democracy and capitalism generated by the collapse of state socialist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in 198991 was short-lived. That triumphalist optimism \"bland futuristic complacency\" in the words of economic historian Adam Tooze began to dim rapidly as predictions about the transition to democracy proved to be wide of the mark.\n\nBotched Transitions In the first years of the twenty-first century, would-be transitions to democracy turned into transitions to new forms of authoritarianism. Particularly vicious and xenophobic populist nationalisms spread from Narendra Modis India through Recep Tayyip Erdoans Turkey to Donald Trumps United States. Instead of the single-party oligarchies and military dictatorships familiar in the decades of the Cold War, something distinct in the history of authoritarianism appeared in the early twenty-first century: populist authoritarianism of the Right as a substitute for the collapse of Soviet-style \"socialist\" regimes and the subsequent disillusionment with more liberal democratic alternatives. In an age of partial democratization, the new populism claimed that present elites were corrupt cartels that did not represent the people, that the \"real\" people were not getting what they deserve, and undeserving others were benefiting from the policies promoted by unresponsive elites. Post-Communist societies were infected by oligarchy, financial and political, and Western democratic politics were distorted by increasing inequality and plutocratic influence in elections and decision-making. Illiberal leaders, using populist and nationalist rhetoric, worked to shift power toward strong executives. The failure of Gorbachevs efforts to establish a democratic socialist polity in the Soviet Union left a global political vacuum. The failure of Gorbachevs efforts to establish a democratic socialist polity in the Soviet Union left a global political vacuum that was filled by a variety of authoritarian regimes, many of them religious in nature (Iran and India come to mind), others nationalist. The defense was to rally around the flag, defend the border, and preserve the nation, something so populist nationalists claim that liberals, globalists, internationalists, and the European Union have neglected. The appeals of the populists differed across the globe, but they generally appeared to be responses to class, regional, and religious resentments that grew in the absence of socialist expression for such discontent. Resentment about being left out, hostility to the idea of goods and benefits going to the undeserving (people of a different race or immigrants), and anxiety about their future dominate these social layers emotionally. Anxiety is fear without a direct object without an immediate, clear reason to be fearful. Such trepidation about an unknown, anticipated future was amorphous but was ginned up by elites that played on the instabilities and insecurities produced by the anarchy of the market and modernitys unpredictable changes. Though far from Marxism, those who responded to the Trumps of the world felt there was a class war between themselves as the authentic people on the one hand and a hostile, unresponsive elite and its paternalistic government on the other. In many ways, the political struggle of our own times is the heir of the historic socialist movements of the past. The fight is over who gets to be represented in and favored by the state. Will it be the elites of wealth, property, and inherited privilege, or will it be the broader public? In many ways, the political struggle of our own times is the heir of the historic socialist movements of the past. While neoliberal capitalism and its attendant politics favor the elite with an anti-statist, pro-market rhetoric (while actually using the state in its own interests), those outside the favored few fight for recognition, protection, and promotion by the state. In the past, this would have been working people, women, people of color; in our own times, besides these still-aspirant groups, there are others who are marginalized and want into the game. This is the source of identity politics, which is then opposed by those already in and fearful of losing their privileged status. Populism is the politics of defining who the authentic, deserving people are. If, as Leon Trotsky once said, Stalinism was \"the syphilis of the workers movement,\" then populism is the syphilis of bourgeois democracy.",

PETERSBURG Mayor Ken Welch on Thursday defended his former deputy mayor, Stephanie Owens, who resigned in the face of an accusation that she maintained a hostile work environment.\n\nHe also said he is eliminating the position and replacing it with a chief of staff.\n\nWelch spoke at a news conference held at the St. Petersburg Police Department about the recent departures of Owens and Communications Director Janelle Irwin Taylor, who quit abruptly last week after leveling the hostile workplace claim. She said Owens created a \"culture of bullying\" while providing little communication or guidance.\n\n\"First, let me say that as mayor of this city, the buck stops with me,\" Welch said. \"I do not believe that there is a pervasive hostile work environment in our city.\"\n\nHe said Owens directly supervised only nine employees out of a workforce of 3,600.\n\nHe said Taylor alleged a hostile work environment related to Owens, her supervisor, in a conversation about proposed changes to the citys communications organization. He said there were no complaints filed, and he was unaware of a problem until the day before Taylor sent submitted her resignation letter. Taylors meeting with the mayor occurred two days before she resigned, according to the letter.\n\n\"Ms. Owens disputes that charge,\" Welch said. \"Its important to respect Ms. Taylors allegation, even without any official complaint. However, its also important to respect the statement of former Deputy Mayor Owens, who refutes those allegations.\"\n\nWelch said he has directed his staff to develop an assessment of city government that will allow employees to give feedback on their current workplace environment and inform policy going forward.\n\n\"If a high-ranking employee didnt have faith in the current process or an understanding of their options, then perhaps other employees dont either and we will address that,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday, Taylor said she stood by her allegations. She also said the conversation with Welch that led to her resignation was not about a reorganization, but rather to address her grievances with Owens.\n\n\"At this point, it is important that I focus on my next career steps, which I will be announcing in the coming days, and move on from the unfortunate circumstances that prompted my resignation,\" Taylor said. \"I encourage existing city staff to heed Mayor Welchs stated goal of providing safe avenues for which to report grievances and hope those channels will provide employees the means to ensure a healthy workplace atmosphere.\"\n\nWelch said the new chief of staff will be responsible for intergovernmental relations, strategic communications and policy initiatives while working with the city administrator. More changes are coming both in personnel and in City Hall, he said.\n\nSpend your days with Hayes Subscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletter Columnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday.

The letter, with signatures removed out of fear of retaliation, was provided to the Tampa Bay Times by a former campaign staffer who said they were one of the people who signed it.\n\n\"That letter has been pointed to by some as evidence of an improper management style by Ms. Owens during the campaign,\" he said. \"It is not.\"\n\nWelch said after he received that letter, he personally interviewed all staff, including those whose names did not appear on it. He said the letter he received is not signed but had the names of three campaign staff typed. He said one campaign staffer was not aware their name was on the letter and said there was no hostile work environment, \"only issues of communication scheduling, assignments and the like.\"\n\nHe said overall, the complaints ranged from not being recommended for a bonus, to staffing issues to not being invited to meetings and other complaints.\n\n\"I intentionally asked every person if they felt unsafe, harassed, threatened or uncomfortable working on the campaign. All responded no,\" Welch said, adding that all but one staffer stayed on for the general election.\n\n\"It has no bearing on the issue at hand,\" Welch said.\n\nOwens tendered her resignation on Sept. 2, but her last day is Friday. Her weekly calendar had no meetings or appointments listed this week. She previously told the Tampa Bay Times she resigned to \"keep any distractions at a minimum.\" She did not respond to a phone call and a text requesting comment Thursday.\n\nWelchs former colleague, Pinellas County Commissioner Janet Long, liked a tweet calling on Welch to fire Owens. Long told the Times on Wednesday that she had heard similar complaints about Owens, saying, \"Its not a good situation.\"\n\n\"I know a lot of people, and on top of that, I serve on a lot of boards that a member of the City Council also serves on. And Im close to a lot of folks who are leaders within the city,\" she said, adding, \"leaders in the city whose interactions (with Owens) have been less than stellar.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Long said it was good that Welch took responsibility and recognized needed changes going forward.\n\n\"I think thats the beginning of a nice reset,\" she said.",

He must also participate in counseling through the agencys Employee Assistance Program and has been demoted from the K9 unit to a patrol squad.\n\nCsendom has been an officer with the department since 2017.

The next thing is, can I save that officer that weve invested a lot of time and effort into?\"\n\nSt. Petersburg police spokesperson Yolanda Fernandez said a 160-hour suspension is standard for officers who have been arrested on a misdemeanor DUI charge.\n\nIn the other case, Officer Brandon Bill was suspended for 250 hours without pay after supervisors found that his commute was logged as on-duty time in his time cards and that a vacation day was marked as time worked. The agency reviewed six months of Bills time logs and GPS locations after they found he had failed to properly mark a vacation day.\n\nFernandez said the officer worked a flexible schedule on the Marine Unit and his failures to correctly log his time were due more to sloppiness than intentional deception, as he failed to correct an auto-populated time log. However, given the number of instances this occurred, the agency could not overlook his errors, she said.\n\nBill joined the agency on Nov. 3, 2008. He has been demoted from the Marine Unit to a patrol squad and 100 hours will be removed from his accrued vacation to make up for the time that was improperly logged.\n\n\"The biggest thing is hes going to serve a suspension without pay, but hes also going to give the taxpayers their money back,\" Holloway said.",

                "cc_text": "Overview If the monarchy is a political institution, and it certainly is, representing certain ideals and values, then the response to the Queens death, too, is entirely political.\n\nReading Time: 6 minutes\n\nI wasnt sure whether I should write this piece so soon after the news of Elizabeth IIs death. I am a UK republican, an advocate of the abolition of the monarchy. Griping about the monarchy at such a moment might not be such a good look, after all. But in the end, I think it better not to give in to the deluge of sentimental conformism flooding the media.\n\nIf royalists can have their say at this moment, why not republicans?\n\nYou might argue that expressing condolences isnt the same as attacking the institution which has just lost its beloved chief. But royalists arent just making their grief known; they are defending the Queens record, and the monarchy itself, implicitly or explicitly.\n\nIn other words, if the monarchy is a political institution, and it certainly is, representing certain ideals and values, then the response to the Queens death, too, is entirely political. The monarchy is an expression of a contestable political view, as are most of the views on it.\n\nSo one can move beyond the question-begging idea that the British monarchy is somehow above or transcends politics, and see all the appeals to republicans to shut up at such a moment for what they truly are: a bullying tactic intended to constrain discussion. By bowing to such rhetoric, republicans unwittingly reaffirm the ideology of monarchy.\n\nAnd why should there not be a discussion about the role of the monarchy right now? Contrary to so much blather, this is precisely the moment we should be talking about the validity of monarchy in modern Britain. After all, the head of state has just died, and her son has automatically replaced her on the basis of bloodline and superstition. Such a significant political moment as this should merit debateand fierce debate at that.\n\nTurn on any news channel right now and you will be deluged with sorrowful images of crowds outside Buckingham Palace mourning the deceased monarch, reels of footage narrating her glorious history, and endless, pointless chatter about her greatness. There is scarcely a dissenting voice to be heard.\n\nIf you are in London, as I am now, you will also notice that the Queens image is plastered on just about every digital billboard and sign in sight. She has even taken over the bus stops. I have to say, and I assert my right to say it in the face of mushy pro-royal consensus, that this is creepy North Korea-style stuff.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that to say everything I have just said (and everything I will go on to say) is not to spit on a dead womans grave. I am not attacking Elizabeth the beloved matriarch, but the Queen, and the institution she represents. I am attacking the political, not the personal.\n\nAnd even I, as staunch a republican as they come, have felt a certain sadness today. The Queen has been around for far longer than I have been alive, and her presence iswasa mighty one indeed. She led an extraordinary life, a truly great life, and I can readily agree with much of what the chatterers are saying about her: she was dutiful and dignified and a constant.\n\nYes, I can assent to all those endlessly repeated platitudes. And I have no wish to be cruel or vile, as those gleefully celebrating the death of an old woman certainly are. In fact, I comforted my own mother earlier, as she cried on the phone to me in grief about the Queens passing. I understand the depth of feeling of the many mourners.\n\nBut that does not mean I must be shy or silent during such a momentous political, social, and cultural juncture. The Queen was a political, public figure who wielded great power (she was not just the head of state but the commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces and the Supreme Governor of the Church of Englandthe CoE being a theocratic vestige of history that is for some reason still allowed significant representation, on a purely confessional basis, in the UK Parliamentnot to mention all her various other prerogatives and privileges both formal and informal), and so is her son. Again: to shut up right now would be to tacitly endorse the royalist view that the monarchy is benignly transcendent. A responder to one of my tweets on the matter earlier put it very well:\n\nI feel like a lot of people who think they're just saying 'acknowledge the Queen and her family as human beings' are really wanting much more than that unearned consensus and something beyond ordinary respect https://t.co/Sd6yzNfZdj honest UK citizen (@Anna59327) September 8, 2022\n\nBack to it, then.\n\nI also resent the insipid idea currently to be found everywhere on social media and in the news that, essentially, \"no matter what your political views, we can all agree that the Queen was unimpeachable, a constant presence above politics, blah blah blah.\"\n\nAllow me to be quite clear in my view on this attempt to drown everyone and everything under a soggy consensus: fuck that.\n\nNo, not everyone can agree. Publicly fawning over a deceased head of state is an explicitly political act, and to use this sort of moral blackmail is to posture as being above politics yourself, just as the monarchy has so expertly done for a very, very long time.\n\nPublicly fawning over a deceased head of state is an explicitly political act, and to use this sort of moral blackmail is to posture as being above politics yourself, just as the monarchy has so expertly done for a very, very long time.\n\nThis again is the royalist illusion: that the monarchy is above and beyond politics. In fact, as I wrote at the time of the Jubilee, the Queen was not some paragon of the apolitical, no angelic embodiment of virtue:\n\n[A]n investigation by The Guardian revealed that the Queen has frequently used an obscure procedure, the Queens consent, to influence government decision-making to her own benefitas, for example, when she successfully lobbied the government to alter a draft law to keep the true extent of her private wealth hidden. And besides what we know, when so much is hidden from public view, how can we know for certain how often and how deeply the monarchy interferes with democratic governance? In addition to the controversies mentioned above, she was caught up in the Paradise Papers scandal and, in my view, has protected her alleged sex abuser son, Prince Andrew, from the serious investigation that he deserves. Allow me to elaborate on that latter accusation. We know from the past that the Queen exercises tight control over the family. Given this, she could at any time have made Andrew face justice, whatever the consequences, and chose not to.\n\nThe Queen, and the monarchy in general, was a political operator par excellence, with a veritable army of press gurus behind her to create the image of the Queen as national grandmother. She possessed great power and used it to her own benefit. In short, she was like every other politician in the world.\n\nAnd what next? Now Prince Charles has morphed into King Charles III, and I think we will all be sorry for it. I am curious as to whether the Queen will turn out to be the last great British monarch. Whatever criticisms I can make of her, she was an outstanding historical figure. Her son, however, is nothing of the sort. As I wrote at the time of the Jubilee:\n\nKing Charles III, the last monarch? I would have preferred the institution to have bowed out on a high with his mother, but I hope his is the final act of the interminable, stultifying Windsor saga.\n\nId like to finish by making explicit the underlying point of everything I have said.\n\nThe monarchy is not a divinely mandated institution but a historical, human creation, whose past is riddled with invented tradition and contingency. Hard as it is to believe, and as sad as it is, the death of Queen Elizabeth II is just that: a historical event. And so it is the right of all of us to speak as we please about it. The nauseating conformity of the media, like the institution of monarchy itself, is as political a phenomenon as a general election. We are in for months of grotesque orthodoxy, of hero worship and even hysteria, on a scale unmatched since the death of Princess Diana.\n\nLet us not, then, be bullied into silence. This is the time for dissent. Republican voices should make themselves heard as much as possible, but not in the nasty way that we see in some of the smellier parts of the Twitter sewer. We must stand on principle, not vindictiveness. I mourn the death, in my own way, of Queen Elizabeth II, and sympathize with those whose private grief is far deeper than my own. But I utterly oppose what she stood for, and what the British monarchy stands for, and I will continue to say so as loudly and freely as I can.",

As of Wednesday evening, Worley remained in the Pinellas County jail with bail set at $20,513, jail records show.\n\nThe investigation that led to Worleys arrest began late in the evening on Aug. 17, when St. Petersburg police and firefighters responded to 911 calls about a dumpster fire in an alleyway behind 2920 Emerson Ave. S.\n\nOnce the flames were extinguished, firefighters and police investigators discovered a body that was described at the time as \"burned beyond recognition\" with \"most of the upper and lower extremities destroyed\" by fire. According to firefighters, the womans body had been doused in a flammable substance before it was set ablaze.\n\nThe medical examiners office later identified the body as that of Heather Elizabeth Olmstead, 31, after obtaining a single, usable thumbprint, according to court records. Those records also said \"the medical examiner has not been able to determine cause or manner of death at this time.\"\n\nCounty records show Olmstead lived off-and-on in Gulfport and Clearwater, but she most recently was described as a \"transient\" in court records from December 2021.\n\nAccording to Worleys arrest report, police investigators recovered some key evidence from the site of the dumpster fire: a cellphone found near the body that was linked to a man Worley knows, and video surveillance from surrounding buildings that showed two trucks pulling away from the scene just after the blaze was lit.\n\nOne, a white Ford pickup truck, was registered to Worleys mother, police said. The other, a black GMC truck, was registered to the man whose cellphone was found near Olmsteads body.\n\nAccording to St. Petersburg police, security footage taken from around the residential neighborhood that night shows both trucks pulling up to a home in the 3300 block of 10th Avenue S just 16 minutes before the fire started. The footage showed the man who lived there walking toward the vehicles and placing a gas can in the bed of the black GMC pickup, police said. Then the video shows the two vehicles leaving together, heading east on Fairfield Avenue toward the site where Olmsteads body was found.\n\nOn Tuesday, the night Worley was arrested, the man living in the home told police that Worley came to his house with her mother and the owner of the black GMC to buy crack cocaine. He also confirmed that the can he put in the truck was full of gasoline.\n\nWant breaking news in your inbox?

She faces one count of abuse of a dead body a third-degree felony.\n\nDetectives are asking anyone with information about the case to call them at 727-893-7780 or text SPPD + your tip to TIP411.",

A conversation about the intersections between domestic violence and community gun violence. Grant High School in Sacramento is celebrating a big anniversary.\n\nWildfire impacts\n\nWildfires in California are becoming increasingly frequent, widespread and devastating. Since 2015, fifteen of the states most destructive fires in recorded history have occurred. Damaging or destroying over 55,000 homes and other buildings and claiming the lives of more than 200 people. But as we measure each new fire by acres burned, homes destroyed, and lives lost, were also beginning to comprehend the toll wildfires are having on the youngest whove survived these extreme disasters. Health screenings of some of the states most underserved families are revealing tens of thousands of children whove lived through these fires are experiencing potentially lasting psychological trauma and other chronic health issues. Heidi de Marco, a correspondent for Kaiser Health News, joined Insight to share how children in Northern California are learning to cope with wildfire trauma.\n\nIntersection of Domestic Violence and Gun Violence\n\nWeve had multiple conversations on Insight about the rise in gun violence and firearm purchases during the pandemic, with deadly examples in Sacramento that have made national news. A mass shooting in downtown Sacramento, followed by another deadly shooting a few months later, and in the county, a father killed his children and their chaperone during a supervised visit. But there are many more that happen on an intimate and individual level that dont receive the same trajectory of attention. Genoa Barrow, a senior writer at the Sacramento Observer, went beyond gun violence and learned about the overlap of domestic violence plays, an intersection with deep roots in mental health, poverty, and socioeconomic inequality. But with little formal research beyond a troubling correlation. Genoa joined us on Insight along with Dr. Shani Buggs, a researcher with the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis.\n\nGrant High Anniversary\n\nThere is a big birthday being celebrated this year in Sacramento. Grant Union High School has been a community stronghold in Del Paso Heights - on Grand Avenue - since its establishment in 1932. Its the third-oldest school in Sacramento, after Sac High and Christian Brothers High. In addition to the schools famous championship football and basketball programs, there are a lot of other things Grant is known for, including a very special musical instrument, its unique aircraft engineering classes, an internationally-acclaimed drumline, and a community swimming pool. All of that history is carefully preserved in the alumni associations museum, and as the school celebrates its 90th anniversary this year, alumni are reflecting on why they consider themselves \"Pacers for life.\" CapRadios Sacramento Communities Reporter, Janelle Salanga, joined Insight to talk about the school, its history, and the people keeping it alive.",

                "cc_text": "It is important to note that pseudo-addiction is also mischaracterized in the Hulu series. It is used as a mechanism to accuse Purdue Pharma of encouraging irresponsible over-prescribing, when in fact it attends to patients in a state of severe \"uncontrolled\" pain. Uncontrolled pain is as devastating as it sounds, especially when we have means to treat it.\n\nOnce again, it is a concept that should be considered scientifically and medically, not simply as a harmful concept \"invented\" by Purdue for profit gains. Uncontrolled pain was not invented by Purdue at all, and has been studied from as early as 1989, before being expanded into the use of opioids for responsible pain management and becoming common amongst pain specialists for over three decades.\n\nSelling Poison\n\nDr. Finnix follows a similar path as the composite \"addict\" character, Betsy Mallum: from OxyContin use to chronic opioid abuse. He never moves to heroin, but he does buy OxyContin illicitly, while being schooled by a local drug dealer on how to get a faster high by crushing and snorting the pills through a straw.\n\nIt's not long before Finnixs collapse is total. He has begun to behave uncharacteristically, beating his Purdue sales rep before manhandling him out of his office for \"selling poison.\"\n\nThe axe finally drops in a grizzly scene when Finnix is high during a surgical procedure. Then, while accompanying his now butchered patient to the ER, he complains to the attending doctor of rib-ache and requests OxyContin unabashedly. The doctor offers him a 10mg tablet, but Finnix ups the request to a 20mg pill in a manner that paints him as perhaps the most suspicious doctor-shopping-doctor imaginable.\n\nThe onus of representation for the addict group falls mostly on Betsy Mallum (Dever), who, when quizzed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly over the fact/fiction nature of her character replies: \"Yes. She's a fictional character that represents a lot of people.\"\n\nBetsy is the first patient that Dr. Finnix turns into an addict. She receives the \"First-Bottle\" of OxyContin, to borrow Episode 1s title, and uses the pain medicine to continue to work at the mines despite an excruciating work-related injury.\n\nThere are two points of note here: Finnix prescribes OxyContin to her with strict instructions for when to take the pills -- one in the morning and one at night -- which Betsy does. He also provides the appropriate advice of a rest period from her grueling work in the mines. He offers to go down and talk to management himself in order for the young woman be able to take a break to aid her physical healing. Betsy does not take his advice.\n\nThis is because of the important part the socioeconomic environment plays in Betsys crucial and unexamined predisposition toward addiction and substance abuse disorder. She knows how the mining industry works and that, in her fathers own account, she is the smallest \"but strongest\" one down there.\n\nBetsy therefore has the obligation of needing both to retain her work: shes a small-statured female and knows she is at high-risk for disposability in a shrinking industry, but she must also fulfill a need for validation from her domineering and deeply religious father. A father who would cast her out if she were to reveal her true self: her sexuality as a lesbian involved in a behind-closed-doors relationship with fellow mine worker, Grace.\n\nThis moves us on to a pivotal point. Even though Betsy is the recipient of the \"first bottle,\" she dumps her prescription by Episode 3, \"The Fifth Vital Sign,\" without tapering of any kind and without informing Dr. Finnix. Subsequently, she descends into a world of illicit diverted pills and eventually heroin. It is the latter drug that takes her life, the night before she is to enter a Suboxone treatment program and after a conversation with Grace, when she finds out that her first love can only be a friend moving forward.\n\nDue to her addiction, Betsy never manages to make \"enough money underground\" to move to Graces Eureka Springs, Arkansas; a real place that Grace describes to Betsy as \"Oz for country queers.\" Devoid of hope after losing her first love, Betsy informs her flop house drug dealer that she is entering a Suboxone treatment center the following day. \"So give me one hell of a sendoff,\" she states as her final, fatal words.\n\nThe Fifth Vital Sign\n\nTo move beyond the episodes sign-posting, the show depicts the medical communitys adoption of pain as the \"Fifth Vital Sign\" as a ploy to fuel over-prescribing. At the time the phrase was introduced, pain was vastly under-treated, there was a pressing need to bring attention to the unmet needs of chronic pain sufferers across the nation, and to facilitate dialogue between physicians and their patients to assess their pain levels and explore treatments with opioids being just one to increase their quality of life.\n\nIntroducing pain as a \"vital sign\" was an entirely reasonable pathway to take by the medical community. Although it is reasonable to argue that pain is not a vital sign in the way that breathing and heart beats are, it is nevertheless vital to assess pain. But once again, it was not a Purdue \"invention\" as the show would usher you to believe, it was first discussed by Dr. James Campbell in an address to the American Pain Society in 1995. The term has faced some controversy, but it was well-intentioned.\n\nWhat Macy failed to do in her mishaps over medical research in her book, which led to Strongs OxyContin demonization, does not befit an analysis of the overdose death of Betsy Mallum. Per scientific examination, the pivotal 1998 CDC-Kaiser Permanente Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study used ten different measures of adverse childhood experiences, drawing the conclusion that that \"for each traumatic event that happened to a child, they were two to four times more likely to grow up to be an addicted adult.\"\n\nThe one we can outline as specific to Betsy is \"parental rejection.\" This is what she fears the most. When Betsy attempts to come out to her mother by stating that she \"likes girls always have and not just as friends,\" her words fall on deaf ears, with her mother quite literally pretending she didnt hear the utterance: \"Did you say something dear?\"\n\nIts a statement Betsys mother later regrets, realizing its impact, but by then it is far too late. Finnixs pre-OxyContin-addiction fishing trip during which he tries to irk Betsys rigid father into the enlightened mindset that being gay is not a sin but just a state of being, also misfires and leads to a demonizing, make-no-mistake style dinner scene.\n\nUnable to live as her true self through fear of rejection and in the throes of withdrawal, Betsy burns the false-self: the one that is content sitting at home and knitting quilts with her in-denial mother.\n\nWhen the news of her death is revealed, we see the camera focus on a picture of Betsy as a young child. This is also emblematic of denial; but this time not of the fictional Mallum family alone, but also of the filmmakers and Macy, who push for the narrative of the destruction of innocence via the opioid scourge.\n\nAddictions Root Causes\n\nThe Mallum parents, through the zealot foisting of religion on a girl who \"never believed in any of that stuff anyway,\" did their daughter a deathly disservice. And they are more culpable for her death than Purdue Pharma or Dr. Finnix.\n\nBetsy had a predisposition for substance abuse disorder, but Finnix did not. Although in Episode 4 we see him in a hallucinated waltz with his deceased wife, he seems content as a widower although the dance scene does belie his underlying existential pain.\n\nThe filmmakers didnt even throw in any trite backstory or anecdote of Finnix having an alcoholic father or brother a detail that would barely be substantiating for predisposition per todays medical rigor over addictions root causes. But it would have at least stimulated the viewer into questioning why this character had morphed so horrifically and so expressly.\n\nThe young Betsy, on the other hand, has a story of her own and one that would undeniably predispose her to substance abuse. Despite Strongs claims, one must stick to individual stories to understand addiction, its roots, and the specific drugs that may come to fuel it.\n\nBy choosing to fictionalize via character composites, and by picking a \"patient\" so heavily predisposed to substance abuse disorder due to ACE and environmental factors, Dopesick doesnt adequately represent the patient side of the doctor-patient relationship at all. The human element that is strong-armed into Finnix and Betsy is loaded for downfall, because that makes for good viewing. One arc is devastating Betsys and Finnixs is convoluted, although redemptive in the end.\n\nCovering all bases in this fashion is hyper-unrealistic, difficult to digest, and self-serving on the part of the filmmakers in their need to enthrall their audience.\n\nWe Have Another Pharma Case\n\nThere is another clandestine narrative at work in Dopesick. A prosecutor fights prostate cancer as he tries to bring Purdue to justice. After waking from a surgical procedure to remove the cancer, even while semi-conscious and in extreme post-surgical pain, he is aghast at the insistency of a nurse who tries to \"force\" OxyContin upon him. Heroically, he refuses and relays the tale back to his boss, who declares he made the \"right choice\" to fight the pain with the over-the-counter, non-narcotic Motrin.\n\nWhat makes the parallel between the prosecutor and Finnix so powerful is that both characters moved from bigger towns to small West Virginian areas and both describe this life choice as the \"best decision I ever made.\"\n\nThe difference between the two characters is that good old Dr. Finnix, the responsible and attentive physician, falls prey to addiction almost immediately, while the representative of law enforcement holds strong.\n\nPer the narrative of the \"Iron Law of Prohibition\" that this show peddles, representatives of the law must be invulnerable. The show pushes this weak theory clearly. After all, who could be more of a \"drop out\" than a physician, who is the biggest threat? Its not the Sacklers, if we follow the human element, but prescribers.\n\nThis good/bad dichotomy is cemented in the last statement made by the chief prosecutor of his future plans: \"We have another pharma case were looking into\" Tellingly, the drug company is not named, perhaps because it couldnt be.\n\nThe fight for pharmaceutical anti-opioid justice is a good story and resonates with the public. But as a society, perhaps we should focus on addiction and its role in the human condition. Treating addiction, as opposed to distilling and misleading the public about its causes, might be a better way to slow the continuing rise of drug overdoses in America.\n\n(Update: Dopesick won two Emmys, for outstanding lead actor and outstanding cinematography.)\n\nLynn R.

The bill was unanimously approved by the Peoples Power Assembly in May 2022.\n\nAs a result, those under the jurisdiction of the Cuban state who commit any of the crimes typified in the new code, will now be tried according to the rules established in its text.\n\nThe new code is substantively identical to the initial version posted on the website of the Peoples Supreme Tribunal (Tribunal Supremo Popular), the entity charged with drafting the text and presenting it to Parliament.\n\nThe deputies that approved the new code called it an example of the perfection and clarity of the Cuban legal system. However, the text opens the way for an increase in the repression of citizen protests, and a limitation of the fundamental rights.\n\nNow, the Cuban government will be able to apply the death penalty for a greater number of criminal offences (24 crimes listed, four more than the 1987 version). Likewise, the number of offences punishable by life sentences increased: (31 types of crimes, an increase of 28 over the past version). In the case of the death penalty, the majority of the crimes were concentrated on cases related to State security.\n\nIn addition, theyll be able to dictate sentences between four and ten years in prison for those who receive or independently finance what the authorities consider activities against the State and the Constitutional order. (Article 143).\n\nThe criminal statute called \"Other acts against State Security\" didnt exist in the 1987 Penal Code. According to this, the individual who \"by themselves or in representation of non-government organizations, institutions of an international character, associations of any form, or any legal or natural entity in the country or of a foreign state, supports, foments, finances, supplies, receives or holds in their power funds, or material or financial resources, with the objective of defraying the cost of activities against the State and its Constitutional order\" are subject to criminal penalties.\n\nThe organisms of political repression now have a new and clear penal statute allowing them to criminalize, for example, the exercise of independent journalism.\n\nThe new code also establishes sentences of up to eight years in prison for those who \"habitually\" leave or try to leave the country illegally. (Article 283.2). The Cuban government maintained this crime in the law, despite the commitments they assumed as part of the migration agreements signed with the United States between 1994 and 1995. Article 283.1 empowers the authorities to prosecute, without a prior judgment, those who are detained on multiple occasions in attempts to leave the national territory.\n\nProsecution will also be implemented for what the Code describes as \"socially unacceptable vices\" (Article 189.3). This variation in the crime of disobedience was created as they argued during the exposition of the bills rationale to confront \"the actions associated with the practice of socially unacceptable vices that arent defined within the current criminal statutes.\"\n\nThis will allow criminal sanctions for the person who repeatedly \"disobeys or fails to comply with measures that have been legally imposed by the competent authorities, or with the warnings issued as the result of their inobservance of measures adopted by the organ or entity charged with social prevention.\" In other words, citizens must now forcibly comply with any warnings or orders issued by Cuban police, even when it involves conduct thats neither illegal nor criminal.\n\nArticle 120 of the new Penal Code considers it a crime to \"attempt to totally or partially change the Constitution of the Republic or the form of government established therein, via the arbitrary exercise of Constitutional rights. Similarly, sanctions are established for \"impeding the President or Vice President, or the superior state and government organs, from exercising their functions, completely or partially, even in a temporary manner.\"\n\nFor doing either of these two things, an individual can receive sentences between four and ten years in prison. Effectively, the code legalizes political repression, given the non-existence in the country of peaceful and democratic channels to promote structural changes.\n\nHence, the publication of the new Penal Code in the Official Gazette began the formal countdown to the implementation of a repressive catalogue, specially designed to combat and avoid any dissent and protest.\n\nBoth of the latter have been on the rise in Cuba lately. The entry into effect of the Penal Code in this new context is yet another addition to the Cuban authorities attempts to detain, through the intimidation produced by repression, the new wave of social discontent.\n\nThe new Penal Code was triggered by the capacity for protest demonstrated by the Cuban public in the summer of 2021. Its principal vocation is that of serving the powers that be by legitimizing the state violence thats been increasing since then, in a way thats proportional to the rebellion of the citizens.\n\nRead more from Cuba here on Havana Times",

Those found guilty could land in prison for up to 15 years. Rights groups and activists have decried the move as a blatant attempt to stifle free speech and legitimate criticism of the war.\n\nCritics of Putin have often ended up in prison or have died in violent or mysterious ways.\n\nPutin's most prominent opponent, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in August 2020, but he managed to survive the attempt on his life. Navalny was imprisoned less than a year later on charges widely condemned as politically motivated, and he remains behind bars.\n\nDespite the recent calls from some local lawmakers, it is highly unlikely that Russia's rubber-stamp parliament would move to oust Putin or that such efforts will impact the war in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We understand that Putin won't shed a tear and stop the operation,\" Nikita Yuferev, one of the councilors from St. Petersburg, told the Post.\n\n\"These requests are written for people who are still in Russia and for whom the propaganda tries to assure that they are the minority, that there are no people who are against this,\" Yuferev said.\n\nContrary to official Russian statements, the Russian military has struggled to make gains in Ukraine while suffering staggering losses.\n\nThe Pentagon recently said Russian casualties in Ukraine are estimated to be as high as 80,000. Meanwhile, the West has moved to cripple Russia's economy via harsh sanctions while moving to isolate Moscow politically. Russia has been condemned across the world for invading Ukraine, and its military has been accused of war crimes and other atrocities.",

An investigative reporter reveals the failures of Californias legal cannabis market since marijuana became legal in the state in 2016. A volunteer group shares how much trash theyre moving from Lake Tahoe and surrounding lakes to help restore their natural beauty.\n\nSacramento's record homeless deaths\n\nNearly 200 unhoused Sacramento County residents died on sidewalks, in tents, vehicles, shelters, or hospitals last year a record number. Thats according to a new report published this week. Its a nearly 50% increase from the year before, and more deaths are linked to hypothermia than in the previous two decades combined. The report also suggests the homicide rate among the unhoused community was nearly 14 times higher than the county homicide rate. CapRadio Reporter Chris Nichols joined Insight to share more on these findings, the difficult conversations being had, and understanding how investment is falling short.\n\nInvestigation into the legal cannabis market\n\nThe passage of Proposition 64 in 2016 came with big promises for California voters. The legalization of recreational cannabis in the largest market in the nation also came with clearing records of those previously prosecuted as well as equity investments. However, heavy taxes and regulations coupled with a lack of enforcement resources to combat illegal grows have led to an explosive black market that is driving out legal businesses. As enforcement agencies work to stamp out one illegal operation, many more pop up and with the outlaw grows come environmental degradation, labor exploitation, violence, and death. Paige St. John, a reporter with the Los Angeles Times, joined Insight to discuss their investigative reporting titled, \"Legal Weed, Broken Promises: The fallout of legal pot in California.\"\n\nCleaning up Lake Tahoe\n\nThe organization's name is simple: \"Clean Up the Lake.\" It's also their mission. Since 2018, Colin West and his group of volunteers have dedicated their time, expertise, and diving skills to go inch by inch along the coastline of Lake Tahoe and surrounding smaller lakes to fish out as much junk and trash as they can get their hands on. Included in those numbers is their latest effort at \"Fallen Leaf Lake,\" near Lake Tahoe, a much smaller and shallower lake. And their work has paid off big-time, but with some surprising results. Colin joined us on Insight to talk about their efforts to clean the lake and what they've found over the years.",

(Part 2)\n\nSometimes you need more than 280 characters to tell a good story.\n\nThis diary was mostly written over five years ago but I only now finished it a few days ago. Before you read any further, you should know that by design, this is a very long, two-part diary as it is a complicated, wide-ranging, and interesting story that covers a great deal of historical ground. It deals with some painful issues which are briefly referenced to provide context and background. To say that Ive spent a fair bit of time researching and writing it is to state the obvious.\n\nFrequently and, at times, relentlessly, we obsess with the \"here and now\" of politics on this blog often communicating and recording our thoughts by using as few characters as possible. In the Age of Twitter, seeking instant gratification and a reaffirmation of our political views seems to be the preferred norm. However, every now and then, it is useful to delve back into history with some effort to search for hidden lessons; hence, this diary.As a suggestion and particularly if you are pressed for time use the social sciences method of reading books and long articles, i.e., read the first paragraph or two, skim through the middle, and read the conclusion of this diary. If you think you might like it, feel free to recommend it. Come back and read the rest of the diary at a leisurely pace. I hope you enjoy doing so. Thanks.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe final and fourth major Grand Slam tennis event of the year, the 142nd edition of the 2022 US Open, is being played this week at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York. This is my second, two-part major diary about professional tennis in the past year, although it is much more than that. The first one was about the 1973 Billie Jean King-Bobby Riggs \"Battle of the Sexes\" tennis match and can be found here \"The Male is King, the Male is Supreme, and Women Should Know That.\" Part I and Part II.\n\nOn occasion, sports and politics collide with the consequences sometimes being deadly. Set against the backdrop of a world on the brink of war, this diary is the chilling story of a tennis champion caught between his desire to excel in international tennis and the demands of loyalty made upon him by his countrys Fascist and rabidly anti-Semitic regime one which detested people like him.\n\nUncivilized Behavior\n\nThe perversion of religion under Fascism. Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahls 1935 Nazi propaganda documentary \"The Triumph of the Will\" is full of twisted religious imagery. Notably, it portrays Adolf Hitler in the opening scene as a messiah descending from the heavens to save the Fatherland and restore Germanys lost glory.\n\nIf alien spaceships from Mars had landed in Western Europe late in the year 1899, the Martians might have pointed toward Germany as a country largely inhabited by enlightened people.\n\nAt the dawn of a new century, it had the second-largest economy in the world, an educated workforce, and a high level of achievement in architecture, science, philosophy, literature, and music, and offered social welfare programs to its citizens when virtually none existed in other developed countries. And yet, a little over three decades later, the same country morphed into Fascist Nazi Germany.\n\nHow could something like this possibly happen? Isn't possessing high culture, on the one hand, somewhat of an indicator and guarantor that the same country would, on the other hand, practice civilized behavior?\n\nNot necessarily, and particularly if you tighten repressive screws over vulnerable groups in German society with a largely acquiescent populace looking on one to whom you promised revitalization of lost glory and restoration of the countrys \"proper place\" in the international order.\n\nWe all have within us the capabilities to behave and act like monsters.\n\nPicture the all-seeing eye looking down on the crucial third match of the 1937 Davis Cup with the two best players of the world, Don Budge and Baron Gottfried von Cramm playing, with the greatest of all time, Bill Tilden, in the stands rooting for his beloved German student, along with Barbara Hutton the Woolworth heiress, deeply in love with Gottfried and showing it at every shot as her second husband gets more and more furious, as Europe prepares for war, Germany recovering from hyperinflation, homosexuals and Jews gradually being stripped of their property and lives, and fighting for their lives on and off the court. Pressured by the Fhrer to \"win...or else,\" Gottfried von Cramm was literally playing for his life. It's two all in matches, extra games, and von Cramm has volleyed a sharp angle 10 feet wide to Budge's weak forehand on the Wimbledon grass with the Queen's interlocutor in the royal box trying to restrain his enthusiasm for the German royal's victory, and stock market volume is way down because they're all following the match on the radio with Al Laney from the New York Herald Tribune broadcasting. \"Take a rest,\" Tilden had told his very good friend. \"I can't,\" von Cramm answered. \"I'm fighting for my life.\" As the players walked to the court, von Cramm had been called back to take a call from the Fhrer. \"We're counting on you to winor else.\" ____________________________________________\n\nVictor Niederhoffer, \"A Terrible Splendor,\" Daily Speculations, December 17, 2009. The title of this diary comes from a book seller's promo of A Terrible Splendor: Three Extraordinary Men, a World Poised for War, and the Greatest Tennis Match Ever Played (New York, 2009) by Marshall Jon Fisher. Fisher played varsity tennis for Brandeis University. The title of Fisher's book comes from a critique of German poet Friedrich Schiller's works. It was written by controversial Scottish philosopher, historian, and essayist Thomas Carlyle, \"Fate [which] envelopes and overshadows...[against which] human will appears but like flashes [of] a brief and terrible splendor, and are lost forever in the darkness.\" The above cartoon is by British political cartoonist Philip Zec. The son of Russian immigrant Jews, he relentlessly attacked Hitler and the Nazis and became known as the \"Peoples Cartoonist.\"\n\nA two-time winner of the French Tennis Open Championships and ranked among the top tennis players in the world during the 1930s as well as being very popular in Germany, Baron Gottfried von Cramm despised the Nazis and refused to either join their party or act as their propaganda tool while competing in international tennis events. He was pressured for months by Herman Goering to officially join the Nazi Party and Cramm kept declining such offers. When offered by Goering to cancel Cramms financial debts (some held by Jewish bankers) resulting in greater financial flexibility and freedom, Cramms refusal to do so puzzled and, even, irked many in the Nazi hierarchy.\n\nGiven his popularity among the public, the Nazis also couldnt afford to alienate Cramm. And Cramm was painfully aware that he had to tread carefully for these Nazis were a different breed of people, hell-bent on eradicating the Jewish race. Cramm's wife, Lisa, was one-fourth Jewish and the granddaughter of a prominent banker, Louis Hagen. After the Nuremberg anti-Semitic laws were enacted in 1935, all Jews were systematically stripped of their civil rights and properties. Citizens were turned into outcasts.\n\nIt would only get worse in the years to come. Much, much worse.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nBaron Gottfried Alexander Maximilian Walter Kurt von Cramm traced his lineage to 12th-century Germany. Unpretentious and gracious in defeat or victory, he often introduced himself simply as Gottfried Cramm. For that reason, unless I quote from books or articles, I mostly refer to him as Cramm, and not von Cramm. Favored to win the mens singles title, he was banned and excluded from the 1939 Wimbledon Championships. American Bobby Riggs one of the two subjects of my previous tennis diary in 2021 would become the Wimbledon champion. Cramm had easily defeated Riggs in the finals of the 1939 Queens Club tournament the week before Wimbledon.\n\nA World on the Brink of Disaster\n\nAmong other \"undesirables,\" if you happened to be Jewish or homosexual in mid-to-late 1930s Nazi Germany, chances were that your luck was about to run out.\n\nA couple of years before much of the world descended into the madness of World War II, it was having a very serious nervous breakdown. With the Great Depression had come severe challenges to the existing political order and the winds of war were blowing fast and furious. The League of Nations with the United States as a notable non-member had either been largely ignored or had proved to be ineffective. For those caught up in the middle of these historical currents, life was about to take a nasty turn.\n\nIn Nazi Germany, society had been transformed under the murderous Fascist policies of Adolf Hitler with several groups targeted for harassment, persecution, and eventual extermination. In Republican Spain, General Francisco Francos Nationalists, supported by the Nazi war machine and Benito Mussolinis thugs, were in full revolt against the countrys democratically-elected government and its friends in the international brigades. Over 40,000 volunteers from 50 countries had defied the supposed \"neutrality\" of their countries and the travel ban imposed by their own governments by sneaking into Spain to help fight Fascism. Stalinist Soviet Union had turned counter-revolutionary, suppressed all dissent, and brutally purged all enemies of the state. It was in the midst of building \"socialism in one country\" an experiment that had no resemblance to real socialism and one which would cost millions of lives. Great Britain and France were feeling the economic strain of precariously clinging to vast empires, with their hold becoming ever more tenuous as the years went by. Not unlike the Soviet Union, neither Britain nor France wanted war and were woefully unprepared to counter the growing Fascist military threat. In the summer of 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War would erupt in Northeast China and lead to millions being killed in the years to come. Buffered by vast two oceans, the United States was in full political isolationist mode, though it had made some economic gains since the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Most Americans followed these events with a mixture of bewilderment and apprehension. Fought a couple of decades earlier and sold as the \"war to end all wars\" by President Woodrow Wilson World War I would come to be seen as the warm-up act to an even more horrific conflict.\n\nIf you happened to be Jewish, homosexual, mentally ill, physically disabled, Socialist, Communist, Jehovah's Witness, or a member of a minority group in Nazi Germany that didn't measure up to Hitler's notion of a superior Aryan race, chances were that you were an \"undesirable\" and your luck was about to run out. Ordinary Germans young and old, friend or foe of the regime, and whether or not they were diehard Nazis were caught up in the fervor unleashed by Hitler's promise of a Third Reich lasting a thousand years. Dissent was strictly forbidden, total conformity was expected of all Germans, and opposition of any kind was ruthlessly suppressed. The one-party state reigned supreme, and that was that. Toe the party line, or suffer the consequences. Step out of line and no one, it seemed, was safe from incurring the wrath of and escaping the long arm of the Gestapo.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nTo learn more about international volunteers during the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War, particularly the Abraham Lincoln Brigades, see my two-part essay: Condemned as \"Premature Anti-Fascists.\" Is There Ever a Bad Time to Oppose Fascism? - Part I and Part II. \"The Holocaust Explained: Nazi treatment of non-Jewish minorities,\" The Weiner Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide (UK).\n\nThe Four Men at the Center of This Remarkable Story\n\nA Jewish emigre from the Russian Empire, Daniel Prenn (with a young Gottfried von Cramm in the background) was the #1 ranked German tennis player. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Prenn was no longer allowed to represent Germany. Word came from the top that they were \"happier to lose with Aryans than to win with Prenn.\"\n\nDecades before several tennis rivalries Borg vs McEnroe, Evert vs Navratilova, Federer vs Nadal (pictured left), King vs Smith, and Sampras vs Agassi would usher in the modern era of tennis, a tennis match took place in London two weeks after the 1937 Wimbledon Championships. It was the semifinal team match between the United States and Germany in the Davis Cup. Amidst this fluid international situation marked by uncertainty and fear of an impending global war, and pitting the #1 players of both teams in the singles competition, it was widely regarded as the \"greatest tennis match ever played.\" It involved four remarkably accomplished tennis players two Americans, a German, and a Jewish engineer by the name of Daniel Prenn who had fled the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution as a teenager. At the time, two of the men harbored secrets that could either land them in prison or, worse, prove to be deadly. For them, fear was a great motivator to succeed on the tennis court.\n\nLong before the Super Bowl, World Series, World Cup, NBA Championships, and Stanley Cup Finals became \"must watch\" events around much of the world, one of the more closely followed competitions was the Davis Cup in amateur tennis. Not unlike Babe Ruth in Baseball, Joe Louis in Boxing, and Jesse Owens in Track and Field, tennis stars like Fred Perry, Donald Budge, Henri Cochet, Suzanne Lenglen, \"Big Bill\" Tilden, Rene Lacoste, Ellsworth Vines, Jean Borotra, Alice Marble, and Gottfried Van Cramm were household names and received a great deal of international media coverage. In fact, one can argue that Bill Tilden, unlike Ruth, was enormously popular not only among American sports fans but equally revered by international tennis enthusiasts. In the pre-television age, amateur exploits in sports had a hold on the publics imagination that is hard to comprehend in the present-day era of rampant commercialism and self-promotion in professional sports.\n\nDonald Budge\n\nThe two Americans, Donald Budge (on the right) and Bill Tilden, had personalities that made them each others polar opposites. They never really competed against one another for by the time Budge rose to prominence, Tilden had turned professional and was barred from competitive amateur play. They resided in separate social worlds and their backgrounds defined the very different paths they chartered to reach the top of the tennis world. Brash, opinionated, and brimming with a sense of entitlement, Tilden came from a privileged family in Philadelphias high society. His affluence meant membership in exclusive tennis clubs like the historic Germantown Cricket Club, from which he grew up only a block away. An unremarkable athlete in high school, he enrolled in the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania just to please his father. Few classmates remembered him years later during the brief period he attended UPenn. A late bloomer and one who worked diligently at teaching himself the nuances of tennis, he didnt win his first major title until he was twenty-seven years old in 1920. The first American to win Wimbledon, he would not lose a consequential tennis match for the next six years.\n\nNot unlike Billie Jean King in the late 1950s and the Willams Sisters in the 1990s, the unassuming, soft-spoken, good-natured Budge, son of a Scottish immigrant and truck driver from Oakland, California, had mastered his craft decades earlier on public tennis courts in California. Only two weeks before this historic match, he had won the Men's Singles title at Wimbledon. A tenacious competitor, who would come to redefine the game of tennis with his devastating backhand and return of serve, he first made the US Davis Cup team when he was only nineteen years old. Growing up in a small house in Oakland unlike Tilden's privileged background in Philadelphia he excelled at baseball and basketball, with tennis as his third sport. When he was fifteen, his father challenged him to win the California State fifteen-and-under tennis title. Remarkably, Budge did just that. He was on his way to becoming an elite tennis player. By the summer of 1937, at twenty-two years old, he was the top-ranked tennis player in the world.\n\n\"Big Bill\" Tilden (left) and Gottfried von Cramm.\n\nBaron Gottfried von Cramm (pictured on the left with Bill Tilden) came from German nobility, with his family tracing its roots in that country for hundreds of years since the Middle Ages. Considered to be a perfect gentleman, he epitomized the sports long tradition of good sportsmanship and even more so than Tilden, had grown up in an aristocratic environment and an atmosphere of affluence. Cramm's family epitomized societal prestige and \"old money.\" It was a world of private tutors, gardeners, maids, cooks, summer estates, horse riding, playrooms, acres of farmland and playing fields, tennis courts, golf courses, ponds, and opulence. World War I had little to no effect on the insular and idyllic life of the von Cramm Family. Central to their years of growing up was a distinct element of British culture, one Brughard von Cramm (Gottfried's father) had become familiar with while a law student in England. English manners, customs, and in particular, love of sports dominated their existence.\n\nIn 1928, when Cramm was only 19 years old, he would meet the most famous tennis player in the world at that time, Bill Tilden. He promised himself that day that he, too, would become a part of the competitive world of international tennis.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nFrank DeFord, Big Bill Tilden: The Triumphs and the Tragedy (New York, 1976), pp 199-201. DeFord recounts Tilden's freshman year at the University of Pennsylvania in 1911 when his mother passed away. Tilden was despondent and decided to take a \"year off from college; it stretched into two, three, four years.\" In 1915, his father died. Tilden would never graduate from college.\n\nBaroness Elisabeth \"Lisa\" von Dobeneck (left) with her husband\n\nBy the mid-1930s, Cramm was a two-time winner of the French Open and among the top-ranked tennis players in the world. After the Nazis came into power in 1933, many of his friends started disappearing into concentration camps. Realistically, what were his choices? Get out of Germany, where his family had lived for over 800 years, or refuse to play for the German national tennis team. His refusal would endanger his wifes life as she was one-fourth Jewish.\n\nBaroness Elisabeth \"Lisa\" von Dobeneck, a granddaughter of Jewish banker Louis Hagen, was a childhood friend of Cramm's and they had married in 1930. The glamorous couple was soon the toast of Berlin and at least superficially, their marriage appeared to be a happy one.\n\nIn addition to being a superb tennis player, Cramm's integrity on the court was beyond reproach and his impeccable manners impressed all who competed against him. Given his privileged background, there was no hint of arrogance or feeling of superiority about him; more than a few opponents would notice his humility and fairmindedness. Budge would say this about his friend in a book written many years later by tennis historian and sportswriter, Bud Collins.\n\nBeing an anti-Nazi was not a comfortable position to be in 1930s Germany. It could easily get you and your family members imprisoned or killed. War talk was everywhere. Hitler was doing everything he could to stir up Germany. The atmosphere was filled with tension although von Cramm was a known anti-Nazi and remained one of the finest gentlemen and most popular players on the circuit. The competition was played at Wimbledon before a rapt audience that included Queen Mary and Jack Benny, to name two. Just before Budge and von Cramm took to Center Court with the series tied at 2-2, von Cramm received a \"supportive\" telephone call from Adolf Hitler.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nRobin Finn, \"Don Budge, First to Win Tennis's Grand Slam, Dies at 84,\" New York Times, January 27, 2000. Fisher, A Terrible Splendor, pp 208-15. Along with many other celebrities in the Centre Court stands were two Americans who would become much more famous by the late 1940s: Ed Sullivan and Ralph Bunche. Watching the match and also keeping a close eye on Cramm was the \"Reich Sport Leader,\" Reichssportfhrer Hans von Tschammer und Osten. All Cramm was interested in was how to win the match, stay alive, and remain a relatively free man.\n\nThe Sports Scene in 1930s Nazi Germany\n\nThe Nazis' ascension to power meant Von Cramm would soon lose a dear friend, teammate, and top-ranked player on the German Davis Cup team. Daniel Prenn, an immigrant to Germany from the Soviet Union, was Jewish and became a victim of draconian anti-Semitic laws.\n\nRegardless of their athletic stature and prominence in German society, no Jewish athlete was exempt from persecution.\n\nGottfried Von Cramm meeting Adolf Hitler and his goons for the first time in 1933. It wasn't a meeting he looked forward to. He was literally caught between a rock and a hard place. ____________________________________________\n\nSee The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936, \"Persecution of Athletes,\" The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, for other examples of German athletes expelled from international competition due to \"racial reasons.\" See this timeline which showed how Jews were systematically excluded from different levels of German sporting activities from 1933-35.\n\nDaniel Prenn (right) with Bill Tilden during the 1932 Davis Cup Finals in Berlin.\n\nDaniel Prenn, representing Berlin's famous Rot-Weiss Tennis Club, had won the German Open Tennis Championships and for four years from 1928-1932, he was ranked as the top player in his adopted country. He had also had a fair bit of success in other international competitions. By the early 1930s, Germany had a strong Davis Cup team. Prenn and the German tennis team had performed admirably against rival teams from France, England, and the United States. With the arrival of another promising young player, Gottfried von Cramm, the formidable German team had defeated heavily-favored Britain in the 1932 Davis Cup only to lose the title match against Bill Tilden and the American team in Berlin. It was said that German tennis fans had \"quietly allowed their hopes, strong as they were, to die.\"\n\nAll of this had occurred against the backdrop of intense political and economic turbulence in Germany. The Weimar Republic had failed to quell internal political turmoil and was, not unlike many other countries, struggling to cope with the economic devastation brought about by the Great Depression. The memory of Germany's humiliating defeat in World War I had created an unstable environment, and one that the Nazis exploited to their advantage. Looking for victims to blame for his country's miserable condition, Hitler had stormed into power by early 1933.\n\nAs a young man, Prenn had fled the Soviet Union and not unlike many of his countrymen, settled in Berlin. For well over a decade, he had prospered in Germany and his tennis skills had catapulted him into celebrity status.\n\nDaniel Prenn (right) and Gottfried von Cramm before leaving Berlin for Italy in 1932. It would be the last time they would play together in the Davis Cup. Daniel Prenn was as unlikely a candidate to become the hero of German tennis as one could imagine. Born a Jew in the Lithuanian city of Vilnius (then part of Russia) in 1904, he had grown up mostly in St. Petersburg. Czarist Russia was no paradise for Jews. Even in urbane, progressive St. Petersburg, Jews were subject to extreme restrictions. There were quotas on how many Jews could practice the law, how many could be admitted to the hospitals, and how many could be buried in the city cemeteries. They could be expelled from the city at any moment under the slimmest of pretexts. And in the provinces, millions of Jews perished in intermittent, bloody pogroms between 1821 and 1917. Then things got worse. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, it was clear that the Communists were no saviors to the Jews. Pogroms broke out again during the revolution and ensuing civil war, killing another 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews. Along with the Russian aristocracy, who were being hunted down and executed by the Bolsheviks, many Jews chose to emigrate. Prenn fled with his family, along with thousands of others, down the well-worn escape route: south to the Crimea, of which the White Army still had control, by ship to the Balkans, and then northwest by rail to Berlin. Berlin had long had a reputation of tolerance towards political refugees, and in 1920, when the Prenns arrived, it was also a cheap place to live. ____________________________________________\n\nFisher, A Terrible Splendor, p. 55. Over 500,000 Russians fled the 1917 Russian Revolution to settle in Berlin, where they were an integral part of economic, cultural, and literary life. Prenn even met Russian novelist and poet Vladimir Nabokov, of Lolita fame, in 1923. The above two photographs and several others used in this diary come from Fisher's website.\n\nIn April 1933, Prenn's tennis career in Germany came to an abrupt end. By this time, he had also earned a Ph.D. in Engineering from the Technical University of Charlottenberg. Moving forward, no non-Aryan was to represent the Third Reich in international sports competitions. Germanys reichssportfhrer (Minister of Sports) issued a statement in which he explicitly stated that \"the player Dr. Daniel Prenn (a Jew) will not be selected for the Davis Cup in 1933.\" A few weeks later, King Gustav of Sweden visited Berlin. A huge tennis fan, he knew Prenn well and played a public doubles tennis match with him at the Rot-Weiss Club to make a point. It mattered little.\n\nCramm protested this decision and tried to persuade Hitler to change his mind. His appeal went nowhere. That year, the German team was favored to win the Davis Cup. The Nazi Regime had decided that they were \"happier to lose with Aryans than to win with Prenn.\" The Germans would not contend again until 1937.\n\nIn addition to a few of Prenn's tennis contemporaries, British tennis players Fred Perry and Henry Wilfred \"Bunny\" Austin vehemently protested the decision. Both Perry and Austin had been members of Britain's 1932 Davis Cup team, one which had been improbably upset 3-2 in the semifinals by Prenn, Cramm, and their German teammates. In the deciding 5th match, Prenn had defeated Perry 3-2 in sets, winning the 5th set 7-5 after being down 2-5 in games and one point away from defeat.\n\nIn a letter to the editor published in the Times (London), they reminded everyone of Prenn's exploits against them.\n\nThe newspaper clipping is from the St Petersburg Times, April 12, 1933. \"Sir, We have read with considerable dismay the official statement which has appeared in the press that Dr. D.D. Prenn is not to represent Germany in the Davis Cup on the grounds that he is of Jewish origin. We cannot but recall the scene when, less than 12 months ago, Dr. Prenn before a large crowd at Berlin won for Germany against Great Britain the semi-final round of the European Zone of the Davis Cup, and was carried from the arena amidst spontaneous and tremendous enthusiasm. We view with great misgivings any action which may well undermine all that is most valuable in international competitions. Yours Faithfully,\n\nH.W. Austin\n\nFred Perry ____________________________________________\n\nAron Lewin, \"Dr Daniel Prenn: A Tennis Career Cut Short by Nazi Germany,\" The Voice, Jewish Holocaust Centre.\n\nLess than a month after Prenn was banned, another prominent German Jewish tennis player, Nelly Neppach (shown below right), committed suicide at the young age of thirty-four. She had been the first female German tennis player to gain international recognition. Suffering from depression and isolation, and with anti-Semitism laws severely restricting her options, she decided to end her life.\n\nThe International Lawn Tennis Federation did absolutely nothing about these injustices. The German Tennis Federation (DTB) issued a brief statement in the May 1933 issue of the DTBs official tennis publication, Tennis and Golf, stating that her life had come to a \"fast end,\" implying that an ongoing problem had been resolved.\n\nThis 2016 exhibition at the German Sports & Olympia Museum in Cologne, Germany explored the fate of 17 prominent Jewish athletes during the Nazi Regime. Outside the museum next to the Rhine River, life-size plexiglass sculptures were displayed for everyone to see. After seizing power in 1933, the Nazis began to systematically persecute and push out Jews including Jewish athletes. They were excluded from their sports clubs, banned from national teams, titles they had won were taken back and they were prohibited from participating in competitions because they were Jewish. Some were murdered like so many of their fellow Jews... Before Hitler took power, these athletes were big stars in the wake of a \"huge boom in sports in the 1920s in Germany,\" historian Hans Joachim Teichler told DW. In 1914, there were about one million gymnasts in Germany and perhaps 100,000 athletes, he said. \"In 1933, there were still a million gymnasts and six million athletes.\" Before the persecution of the Jews, religion never played a role in public sports clubs, Teichler argued. \"They were respected, voted on the board and awarded emblems and honors like the Golden Eagle.\" But the political and social situation took a drastic turn. ____________________________________________\n\nHenry Wahlig, \"Between Success and Persecution: Jewish Stars in German Sport Until 1933 and Beyond,\" Jewish Sports Stars. Ruben Kalus, \"Olympics 1936: How the Nazis Treated Jewish Athletes,\" Deutsche Welle, August 5, 2016.\n\nIn the 1930s when most of the world was suffering from the debilitating economic effects of the Great Depression, speaking up for and defending victims of Nazi Germany was not a high priority for too many people including those in most of the \"civilized\" world. Political and economic isolationism had shrunk the minds of many people whose major focus in life was just trying to survive and live under harsh economic conditions.\n\nGay Life in Weimar and Nazi Germany\n\nDecades before anyone had ever heard of the Nazis, Berlin had been one of the more tolerant cities in Europe and became famous for public displays of different types of sexuality. Noted author Thomas Mann and physicist Albert Einstein were huge supporters and proponents of the rights of gay men and women. This was the familiar environment known to Cramm and his friends. Married at the age of twenty-one in 1930, he kept up appearances by hosting cocktail parties and attending dinners at the Rot-Weiss Club, implying that he was enjoying life with his new bride. At the time, there were over 200,00 homosexuals in Berlin and 600 nightclubs, including 85 clubs just for lesbians. The local police practiced a tradition of acceptance, so long as people were discreet in their liaisons. World War I, the bloodiest war to date in history, had engendered a libertine lifestyle and \"devil may care\" attitude among many young men and women.\n\nCramm would soon start meeting men he was attracted to. In Weimar Berlin, you could pretty much do what your heart desired, although there are no credible reports of Von Cramm partying all night or flaunting his discreet monogamous relationships.\n\nGay clubs in Weimar Berlin were at the center of the citys bustling gay and transvestite scene while hosting cabaret artists such as Marlene Dietrich. [Cramm] had apparently signed a confession admitting to homosexual acts of indecency with a young Jewish actor called Manasse Herbst, and he further admitted sending money to Herbst allegedly when the former had tried to blackmail him about their clandestine relationship. There is little doubt that Von Cramm had indeed had a relationship with Herbst. However, the exact status of Von Cramms sexuality remains the subject of a little conjecture... What is clear, is that at the time of his first marriage, the night life in Berlin had a very laissez faire and promiscuous tinge to it. Berlin was awash with gay night clubs, lesbian only night clubs, bisexual night clubs and night clubs where all sorts of sexual partners of both sexes were ten a penny. Keeping up appearances. The above photograph shows Cramm with three of the top female players in the 1930s Britain's Katherine Stammers along with Americans Helen Jacobs and Alice Marble. Von Cramm kept his private life and whatever sex life he had extremely private and under wraps. Many believed him to be homosexual, yet many young women fell at his feet too. The Baron simply said nothing and kept such things to himself. ____________________________________________\n\nFisher, A Terrible Splendor, pp 47-48 and pp 70-72. Young gay men, like the English writer Christopher Isherwood, had moved to Berlin and said, \"Berlin means boys.\" His friend, W.H. Auden, agreed with him.\n\n\"The King, The Baron, The House painter and Boris!,\" Strandsky Tales and Stories, June 14, 2014. Cramms homosexuality was well-known in international tennis cirlcles.\n\nErnst Rhm (right) with Adolf Hitler.\n\nUnder the leadership of Ernst Rhm (pictured on the right with Adolf Hitler), the Sturmabteilung (Storm Troopers; SA), or \"Brownshirts\" as they were commonly referred to, played a pivotal role in propelling Hitler to power. Using intimidating tactics against anyone who opposed them, the political violence unleashed by the SA had made them a force to be feared and reckoned with. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles had limited the German army to 100,000 soldiers; by 1934, however, the SA numbered 3-4 million men. Rhm wanted to merge the army with his paramilitary force and one that would be under his command. A later joke referred to the SA as resembling roast beef. Why? Because they were brown on the outside (their uniforms) and red inside (socialist beliefs). Once in power and rather than have his boss rely upon the army and wealthy industrialists to expand the regime's power and capabilities Rhm wanted Hitler to implement the \"socialist\" part of their agenda to redistribute wealth. The real revolution, he argued, had yet to take place.\n\nA decorated German army officer during World War I, Rhm had known Hitler since the early 1920s and both men were determined to counter the \"betrayal\" of the German High Command in signing the Versailles Peace Treaty. High-ranking Nazis had been well aware of Rhm and other homosexuals in the SA. Ignoring that fact as \"immaterial,\" Hitler repeatedly said that it didn't bother him how Rhm and his associates conducted themselves in private.\n\nOnce in power and seizing upon this opportunity to limit the SA's influence while condemning homosexuality as \"deviant behavior,\" Hitler moved against his old friend and early supporter. It came to be known as the Night of the Long Knives, or die Nacht der langen Messer, a phrase Hitler himself selected from a popular Nazi song to describe the SA's purge.\n\nDavid Lows cartoons would deeply anger Adolf Hitler, who complained vociferously to British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, about it. In the late 1930s, Low would be repeatedly attacked by the conservative British press as being hostile to the idea of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasing Hitler. Between June 30 and July 2, 1934, the Nazi Party leadership, on the order of Nazi Party Leader and Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler, purged the leadership of the Nazi paramilitary formation, the Sturmabteilungen (Storm Troopers; SA). The Nazi leaders took advantage of the purge to kill other political enemies, primarily on the German nationalist right. Known as the \"Night of the Long Knives\" or \"Operation Hummingbird,\" the murders cemented an agreement between the Nazi regime and the German Army (Reichswehr) that enabled Hitler to proclaim himself Fhrer of National Socialist Germany and to claim absolute power. By 1934 Adolf Hitler appeared to have complete control over Nazi Germany, but like most dictators, he constantly feared that he might be ousted by others who wanted his power. To protect himself from a possible coup, Hitler used the tactic of divide and rule and encouraged other leaders such as Hermann Gring, Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler and Ernst Rhm to compete with each other for senior positions. Albert Speer pointed out in his book, Inside the Third Reich (1970): \"After 1933 there quickly formed various rival factions that held divergent views, spied on each other, and held each other in contempt. A mixture of scorn and dislike became the prevailing mood within the party. Each new dignitary rapidly gathered a circle of intimates around him.\" Joseph Goebbels wrote in his diary: \"Executions nearly finished. A few more are necessary. That is difficult but necessary... It is difficult but is not, however, to be avoided. There must be peace for ten years. The whole afternoon with the Fhrer. I can't leave him alone. He suffers greatly but is hard. The death sentences are received with the greatest seriousness. All in all about 60.\" ____________________________________________\n\n\"The Nazi Party: The Night of the Long Knives,\", Jewish Virtual Library. In 1933, Rhm had made a speech in which he reminded his opponents about the Nazi agenda, \"It is in fact high time the national revolution stopped and became the National Socialist one. Whether they like it or not, we will continue our struggle if they understand at last what it is about with them; if they are unwilling without them; and if necessary against them.\" Editorial Cartoonist David Low was appalled when Hitler became Germany's Chancellor and persistently mocked what the Nazis stood for in his editorial cartoons. He noted in his book Years of Wrath (1949) that Hitler was deeply angered by the above cartoon published one day after the SA purge was announced by Joseph Goebbels, shown above cowering between's Hitler's legs. Herman Goering is represented by the Hun as a violent god of war. The cartoon strongly suggested that there was no substantive difference between the murderous Nazis and \"uncivilized Huns,\" a nomadic people who had spread fear and terror in much of 5th century Europe. \"Night of the Long Knives,\" Spartacus Educational.\n\nHeinrich Himmlers Gestapo Thugs and the Persecution of Gays in Nazi Germany\n\nBy eliminating Ernst Rhm and others in the SA leadership, Hitler consolidated power and removed a potential threat to his authority. From then on, he emerged as Germany's Supreme Leader who \"had the right to be judge and jury, and had the power to decide whether people lived or died.\"\n\nThis exhibition by the Florida Holocaust Museum examines the Nazi regimes attempt to eradicate homosexuality, which left thousands dead and shattered the lives of many more. One attempt by the Nazis to purify German society was their condemnation of male homosexuals as \"socially aberrant.\" Early in the Nazi regime, male homosexual organizations were banned.\n\nIn 1934, a special Gestapo division was established to create \"pink lists\" of homosexuals throughout Germany.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1945, an estimated 100,000 men were arrested, and of these, some 50,000 homosexuals were sentenced. Most of these men spent time in regular prisons, and an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 were sent to concentration camps.\n\nLesbians were not subjected to systematic persecution. Few women are believed to have been arrested.\n\nThose defined as homosexuals were designated by a pink triangle (Jews who were homosexuals were killed because they were Jews) ____________________________________________\n\nSee this extensive bibliography of resources in English and other languages about the Nazi persecution of gays and lesbians, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Click on this slideshow to learn more about non-Jewish victims of Nazi Germany. The Nazis were determined to \"purge\" their country of gays. The dreaded Gestapo or Geheime Staatspolizei, Secret State Police went around rounding up enemies (real or not) and closed down many gay bars. Berlin, the \"homosexual's paradise,\" was about to undergo drastic changes. Rhm's archenemy, Reichsfhrer Heinrich Himmler, ordered the Gestapo that he wanted a complete list of all active homosexuals. People were bribed to testify against friends and neighbors, with many using this opportunity to settle old scores. Vowing to protect the \"moral fiber\" of German society, Himmler's thugs sent tens of thousands of homosexuals to concentration camps, including several of Cramms friends.\n\nBadge Classification System in Nazi Concentration Camps In Nazi Concentration Camps, the colored triangle identified who the prisoner was. It was also meant as a badge of shame. Pink triangles were for homosexuals or those suspected of being one. The Night of the Long Knives was a huge triumph for Hitler... The purge of the SA was the first great show of violence under Nazi rule. It would not be the last. Hitler had taken a giant step closer to creating his Master Race. There was no place for homosexuality with the Master Race. Rhm had been a very public figure in Germany, and his murder delivered a strong message. Now that the party had been cleansed, the targets became any men who preferred to have sex with other men. One such man was Rudolf Brazda... Like all homosexuals, Rudolf was aware of Paragraph 175, but he and most other homosexuals knew that usually they would be left alone if they were discreet and not seeking relationships with young boys. However, as all homosexuals were to discover, this world was changing more rapidly than they could imagine... Fear dominated life for homosexuals. When interviewed years later, Rudolf said, \"We were hunted like animals.\" Following World War II, the pink triangle came to symbolize the persecution of gay men. It was later repurposed in recent decades to celebrate gay pride. Predating the Nazis all the way back to 1871, Paragraph 175 of the German Criminal Code outlawed sexual relations between men. It wasnt revoked until 1994. ____________________________________________\n\nKen Setterington, \"The Gay Life is Over,\" Branded by the Pink Triangle (Toronto, 2013), pp 25-27.

                "cc_text": "Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping was riding high. He had consolidated power within the Chinese Communist Party. He had elevated himself to the same official status as the CCPs iconic leader, Mao Zedong, and done away with presidential term limits, freeing him to lead China for the rest of his life. At home, he boasted of having made huge strides in reducing poverty; abroad, he claimed to be raising his countrys international prestige to new heights. For many Chinese, Xis strongman tactics were the acceptable price of national revival.\n\n(Read in Chinese).\n\nOutwardly, Xi still projects confidence. In a speech in January 2021, he declared China \"invincible.\" But behind the scenes, his power is being questioned as never before. By discarding Chinas long tradition of collective rule and creating a cult of personality reminiscent of the one that surrounded Mao, Xi has rankled party insiders. A series of policy missteps, meanwhile, have disappointed even supporters. Xis reversal of economic reforms and his inept response to the COVID-19 pandemic have shattered his image as a hero of everyday people. In the shadows, resentment among CCP elites is rising.\n\nI have long had a front-row seat to the CCPs court intrigue. For 15 years, I was a professor in the Central Party School, where I helped train thousands of high-ranking CCP cadres who staff Chinas bureaucracy. During my tenure at the school, I advised the CCPs top leadership on building the party, and I continued to do so after retiring in 2012. In 2020, after I criticized Xi, I was expelled from the party, stripped of my retirement benefits, and warned that my safety was in danger. I now live in exile in the United States, but I stay in touch with many of my contacts in China.\n\nAt the CCPs 20th National Party Congress this fall, Xi expects that he will be given a third five-year term. And even if the growing irritation among some party elites means that his bid will not go entirely uncontested, he will probably succeed. But that success will bring more turbulence down the road. Emboldened by the unprecedented additional term, Xi will likely tighten his grip even further domestically and raise his ambitions internationally. As Xis rule becomes more extreme, the infighting and resentment he has already triggered will only grow stronger. The competition between various factions within the party will get more intense, complicated, and brutal than ever before.\n\nAt that point, China may experience a vicious cycle in which Xi reacts to the perceived sense of threat by taking ever bolder actions that generate even more pushback. Trapped in an echo chamber and desperately seeking redemption, he may even do something catastrophically ill advised, such as attack Taiwan. Xi may well ruin something China has earned over the course of four decades: a reputation for steady, competent leadership. In fact, he already has.\n\nTHE CHINESE MAFIA\n\nIn many respects, the CCP has changed little since the party took power in 1949. Now, as then, the party exercises absolute control over China, ruling over its military, its administration, and its rubber-stamp legislature. The party hierarchy, in turn, answers to the Politburo Standing Committee, the top decision-making body in China. Composed of anywhere from five to nine members of the broader Politburo, the Standing Committee is headed by the partys general secretary, Chinas paramount leader. Since 2012, that has been Xi.\n\nThe details of how the Standing Committee operates are a closely guarded secret, but it is widely known that many decisions are made through the circulation of documents dealing with major policy questions, in the margins of which the committees members add comments. The papers are written by top leaders in ministries and other party organs, as well as experts from the best universities and think tanks, and to have ones memo circulated among the Standing Committee members is considered a credit to the writers home institution. When I was a professor, the Central Party School set a quota for the production of such memos of about one a month. Authors whose memos were read by the Standing Committee were rewarded with the equivalent of roughly $1,500more than a professors monthly salary.\n\nAnother feature of the party system has remained constant: the importance of personal connections. When it comes to ones rise within the party hierarchy, individual relationships, including ones family reputation and Communist pedigree, matter as much as competence and ideology.\n\nThe CCP is more of a mafia organization than a political party.\n\nThat was certainly the case with Xis career. Contrary to Chinese propaganda and the assessment of many Western analysts that he rose through his talent, the opposite is true. Xi benefited immensely from the connections of his father, Xi Zhongxun, a CCP leader with impeccable revolutionary credentials who served briefly as propaganda minister under Mao. When Xi Jinping was a county party chief in the northern province of Hebei in the early 1980s, his mother wrote a note to the provinces party chief asking him to take an interest in Xis advancement. But that official, Gao Yang, ended up disclosing the notes content at a meeting of the provinces Standing Committee. The revelation was a great embarrassment to the family since it violated the CCPs new campaign against seeking favors. (Xi would never forget the incident: in 2009, when Gao died, he pointedly declined to attend his funeral, a breach of custom given that both had served as president of the Central Party School.) Such a scandal would have ruined the average rising cadres career, but Xis connections came to the rescue: the father of Fujians party chief had been a close confidant of Xis father, and the families arranged a rare reassignment to that province.\n\nXi would continue to fail upward. In 1988, after a poor showing in a municipal peoples congress election, rather than being demoted from his position as a deputy mayor, he became a prefecture party chief. Once there, however, Xi languished on account of his middling performance. In the CCP, moving from the prefecture level to the provincial level is a major hurdle, and for years, he could not overcome it. But once again, family connections intervened. In 1992, after Xis mother wrote a plea to the new party leader in Fujian, Jia Qinglin, Xi was transferred to the provincial capital. At that point, his career took off.\n\nAs all lower-level cadres know, to climb the CCP ladder, one must find a higher-level boss. In Xis case, this proved easy enough, since many party leaders held his father in high esteem. His first and most important mentor was Geng Biao, a top diplomatic and military official who had once worked for Xis father. In 1979, he took on the younger Xi as a secretary. The need for such patrons early on has knock-on effects decades down the line. High-level officials each have their own \"lineages,\" as insiders call these groups of protgs, which amount to de facto factions within the CCP. Indeed, disputes that are framed as ideological and policy debates within the CCP are often something much less sophisticated: power struggles among various lineages. Such a system can also lead to tangled webs of personal loyalty. If ones mentor falls out of favor, the effect is the professional equivalent of being orphaned.\n\nOutsiders may find it helpful to think of the CCP as more of a mafia organization than a political party. The head of the party is the don, and below him sit the underbosses, or the Standing Committee. These men traditionally parcel out power, with each responsible for certain areasforeign policy, the economy, personnel, anticorruption, and so on. They are also supposed to serve as the big bosss consiglieres, advising him on their areas of responsibility. Outside the Standing Committee are the other 18 members of the Politburo, who are next in the line of succession for the Standing Committee. They can be thought of as the mafias capos, carrying out Xis orders to eliminate perceived threats in the hope of staying in the good graces of the don. As a perk of their position, they are allowed to enrich themselves as they see fit, seizing property and businesses without penalty. And like the mafia, the party uses blunt tools to get what it wants: bribery, extortion, even violence.\n\nSHARING IS CARING\n\nAlthough the power of personal connections and the flexibility of formal rules have remained constant since Communist Chinas founding, one thing has shifted over time: the degree to which power is concentrated in a single man. From the mid-1960s onward, Mao had absolute control and the final say on all matters, even if he exercised his power episodically and was officially merely first among equals. But when Deng Xiaoping became Chinas de facto leader in 1978, he chipped away at Maos one-man, lifelong dictatorship.\n\nDeng restricted Chinas presidency to two five-year terms and established a form of collective leadership, allowing other officialsfirst Hu Yaobang and then Zhao Ziyangto serve as head of the party, even if he remained the power behind the throne. In 1987, the CCP decided to reform the process for selecting members of the Central Committee, the partys nominal overseer and the body from which Politburo members are chosen. For the first time, the party proposed more candidates than there were seatshardly a democratic election, but a step in the right direction. Even the endorsement of Deng could not guarantee success: for example, Deng Liqun, a Maoist ideologue whom Deng Xiaoping had promised to promote to the Politburo, failed to earn enough votes and was forced to retire from political life. (It is worth noting that when the Central Committee held an election in 1997, Xi barely squeaked by. He had the fewest votes of all those selected to join, reflecting a general distaste within the party for \"princelings,\" descendants of top CCP leaders who rose thanks to nepotism rather than merit.)\n\nSeeking to avoid a repeat of the disastrous Cultural Revolution, when Maoist propaganda reached its apogee, Deng also sought to prevent any leader from forming a cult of personality. As early as 1978, a student from the Central Party School who was a close family friend noticed on a school trip to a pig farm in the Beijing suburbs that items that Hua Guofeng had used on an inspection visita hot water bottle, a teacupwere displayed in a glass cabinet, as if it were a religious shrine. My friend wrote to Hua criticizing the personal worship, and Hua had the display removed. In 1982, Chinas leaders went so far as to write into the party constitution a ban on cults of personality, which they viewed as uniquely dangerous.\n\nFamily reputation and pedigree matter as much as competence and ideology to the Communist Party.\n\nDeng was willing to go only so far in sharing power, and he forced out Hu and Zhao successively when each proved too politically liberal. But Dengs successor, Jiang Zemin, deepened the political reforms. Jiang institutionalized his group of advisers to operate more as an executive office. He sought advice from all members of the Standing Committee, which now made decisions by majority vote, and he circulated draft speeches widely. Jiang also made the elections to the Central Committee slightly more competitive by increasing the ratio of candidates to seats. Even princelings, including one of Dengs sons, lost their elections.\n\nWhen Hu Jintao took over from Jiang in 2002, China moved even further toward collective leadership. Hu ruled with the consent of the nine members of the Standing Committee, a clique known as the \"nine dragons controlling the water.\" There were downsides to this egalitarian approach. A single member of the Standing Committee could veto any decision, driving the perception of Hu as a weak leader unable to overcome gridlock. For nearly a decade, the economic reforms that began under Deng stalled. But there were upsides, too, since the need for consensus prevented careless decisions. When SARS broke out in China during his first year in office, for instance, Hu acted prudently, firing Chinas health minister for covering up the extent of the outbreak, and encouraging cadres to report infections truthfully.\n\nHu also sought to expand the use of term limits. Although he ran into resistance when he tried to institute term limits for members of the Politburo and its Standing Committee, he did manage to introduce them at and below the provincial and ministerial level. More successfully, Hu established an unprecedented process by which the composition of the Politburo was first selected by a vote of senior party members.\n\nIronically, it was through this quasi-democratic system that Xi rose to the heights of power. In 2007, at an expanded meeting of the Central Committee, the CCPs top 400 or so leaders gathered in Beijing to cast votes recommending which ministerial-level officials from a list of 200 should join the 25-member Politburo. Xi received the most. The deciding factor, I suspect, was not his record as party chief of Zhejiang or Shanghai but the respect voters held for his father, along with the endorsement of (and pressure from) some key party elders. In a similar advisory election five years later, Xi got the most votes and, by the consensus of the outgoing leaders, ascended to the top of the pyramid. He swiftly got to work undoing decades of progress on collective leadership.\n\nPARTY OF ONE?\n\nWhen Xi took the reins, many in the West hailed him as a Chinese Mikhail Gorbachev. Some imagined that, like the Soviet Unions final leader, Xi would embrace radical reforms, releasing the states grip on the economy and democratizing the political system. That, of course, turned out to be a fantasy. Instead, Xi, a devoted student of Mao and just as eager to leave his mark on history, has worked to establish his absolute power. And because previous reforms failed to place real checks and balances on the party leader, he has succeeded. Now, as under Mao, China is a one-man show.\n\nOne part of Xis plot to consolidate power was to solve what he characterized as an ideological crisis. The Internet, he said, was an existential threat to the CCP, having caused the party to lose control of peoples minds. So Xi cracked down on bloggers and online activists, censored dissent, and strengthened Chinas \"great firewall\" to restrict access to foreign websites. The effect was to strangle a nascent civil society and eliminate public opinion as a check on Xi.\n\nAnother step he took was to launch an anticorruption campaign, framing it as a mission to save the party from self-destruction. Since corruption was endemic in China, with nearly every official a potential target, Xi was able to use the campaign as a political purge. Official data show that from December 2012 to June 2021, the CCP investigated 393 leading cadres above the provincial and ministerial level, officials who are often being groomed for top positions, as well as 631,000 section-level cadres, foot soldiers who implement the CCPs policies at the grassroots level. The purge has ensnared some of the most powerful officials whom Xi deemed threatening, including Zhou Yongkang, a former Standing Committee member and the head of Chinas security apparatus, and Sun Zhengcai, a Politburo member whom many saw as a rival and potential successor to Xi.\n\nA bust of Xi, Jiangxi province, China, June 2019 Jason Lee / Reuters\n\nTellingly, those who helped Xi rise have been left untouched. Jia Qinglin, Fujians party chief in the 1990s and eventually a member of the Standing Committee, was instrumental in helping Xi climb the ranks of power. Although there is reason to believe that he and his family are exceedingly corruptthe Panama Papers, the trove of leaked documents from a law firm, revealed that his granddaughter and son-in-law own several secret offshore companiesthey have not been caught up in Xis anticorruption campaign.\n\nXis tactics are not subtle. As I learned from one party insider whom I cannot name for fear of getting him in trouble, around 2014, Xis men went to a high-ranking official who had openly criticized Xi and threatened him with a corruption investigation if he didnt stop. (He shut up.) In pursuing their targets, Xis subordinates often pressure officials family members and assistants. Wang Min, the party chief of Liaoning Province, whom I knew well from our days as students at the Central Party School, was arrested in 2016 on the basis of statements from his chauffeur, who said that while in the car, Wang had complained to a fellow passenger about being passed over for promotion. Wang was sentenced to life in prison, with one of the charges being resistance to Xis leadership.\n\nAfter ejecting his rivals from key positions, Xi installed his own people. Xis lineage within the party is known as the \"New Zhijiang Army.\" The group consists of his former subordinates during his time as governor of Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces and even university classmates and old friends going back to middle school. Since assuming power, Xi has quickly promoted his acolytes, often beyond their level of competence. His roommate from his days at Tsinghua University, Chen Xi, was named head of the CCPs Organization Department, a position that comes with a seat on the Politburo and the power to decide who can move up the hierarchy. Yet Chen has no relevant qualifications: his five immediate predecessors had experience with local party affairs, whereas he spent nearly all his career at Tsinghua University.\n\nXi and his deputies have demanded a degree of loyalty not seen since Mao.\n\nXi undid another major reform: \"the separation of party and state,\" an effort to reduce the degree to which ideologically driven party cadres interfered with technical and managerial decisions in government agencies. In an attempt to professionalize the bureaucracy, Deng and his successors tried, with varying degrees of success, to insulate the administration from CCP interference. Xi has backtracked, introducing some 40 ad hoc party commissions that end up directing governmental agencies. Unlike his predecessors, for example, he has his own team to handle issues regarding the South China Sea, bypassing the Foreign Ministry and the State Oceanic Administration.\n\nThe effect of these commissions has been to take significant power away from the head of Chinas government, Premier Li Keqiang, and turn what was once a position of co-captain into a sidekick. The change can be seen in the way Li comports himself in public appearances. Whereas Lis two immediate predecessors, Zhu Rongji and Wen Jiabao, stood side by side with Jiang and Hu, respectively, Li knows to keep his distance from Xi, as if to emphasize the power differential. Moreover, in the past, official communications and state media referred to the \"Jiang-Zhu system\" and the \"Hu-Wen system,\" but almost no one today speaks of a \"Xi-Li system.\" There has long been a push and pull between the party and the government in Chinawhat insiders call the struggle between the \"South Courtyard\" and the \"North Courtyard\" of Zhongnanhai, the imperial compound that hosts the headquarters of both institutions. But by insisting that everyone look up to him as the highest authority, Xi has exacerbated tensions.\n\nXi has also changed the dynamic within the Standing Committee. For the first time in CCP history, all Politburo members, even those on the Standing Committee, must report directly to the head of the party by submitting periodic reports to Xi, who personally reviews their performance. Gone is the camaraderie and near equality among Standing Committee members that once prevailed. As one former official in Beijing told me, one of the committees seven membersWang Qishan, Chinas vice president and a longtime ally of Xihas grumbled to friends that the dynamic between Xi and the lesser members is that of an emperor and his ministers.\n\nXi is positioning himself not as merely a great party leader but as a modern-day emperor.\n\nThe most brazen change Xi has ushered in is to remove Chinas presidential term limit. Like every paramount leader from Jiang onward, Xi holds three positions concurrently: president of China, leader of the party, and head of the military. Although the limit of two five-year terms applied only to the first of those three positions, beginning with Hu, there was an understanding that it must also apply to the other two to make it possible for the same person to hold all three posts.\n\nBut in 2018, at Xis behest, Chinas legislature amended the constitution to do away with the presidential term limit. The justification was laughable. The professed goal was to make the presidency consistent with the party and military positions, even though the obvious reform would have been the reverse: to add term limits to those positions.\n\nThen there is the cult of personality. Even though the ban on such cults remains in the party constitution, Xi and his deputies have demanded a degree of loyalty and admiration for the leader not seen since Mao. Ever since 2016, when Xi was declared the partys \"core leader\" (a term never given to his predecessor, Hu), Xi has positioned himself in front of members of the Standing Committee in official portraits. His own portraits are hung everywhere, Mao style, in government offices, schools, religious sites, and homes. According to Radio France Internationale, Xis subordinates have proposed renaming Tsinghua University, his alma mater and Chinas top school, Xi Jinping University. They have even argued for hanging his picture alongside Maos in Tiananmen Square. Although neither idea went anywhere, Xi did manage to get Xi Jinping Thought enshrined in the partys constitution in 2017joining Mao as the only other leader whose own ideology was added to the document while in officeand in the state constitution the next year. In one lengthy article published in Xinhua, the state media organ, in 2017, a propagandist crowned Xi with seven new North Koreanstyle titles that would have made his post-Mao predecessors blush: \"groundbreaking leader,\" \"diligent worker for the peoples happiness,\" \"chief architect of modernization in the new era,\" and so on.\n\nWithin the party, Xis lineage is carrying out a fierce campaign insisting that he be allowed to stay in power to finish what he started: namely, \"the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\" As their efforts intensify, their message is being simplified. In April, party officials in Guangxi proposed a new slogan: \"Always support the leader, defend the leader, and follow the leader.\" In an echo of Maos \"little red book,\" they also issued a pocket-size collection of Xi quotations and invited citizens to memorize its contents. Xi seems to be positioning himself not as merely a great party leader but as a modern-day emperor.\n\nTHE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES\n\nThe more a political system centers on a single leader, the more the flaws and peculiarities of that leader matter. And in the case of Xi, the leader is thin-skinned, stubborn, and dictatorial.\n\nThese qualities were in evidence even before he took office. In 2008, Xi became president of the Central Party School, where I taught. At a faculty meeting the next year, the number two official at the school conveyed Xis threat to teachers that he would \"never allow them to eat from the partys rice bowl while attempting to smash the partys cooking pot\"meaning taking government pay while discreetly criticizing the system. Angry about Xis absurd notion that it was the party, not Chinese taxpayers, that bankrolled the state, I talked back from my seat. \"Whose rice bowl does the Communist Party eat from?\" I asked out loud. \"The Communist Party eats from the peoples rice bowl but smashes their cooking pot every day.\" No one reported me; my fellow professors agreed with me.\n\nXi acts as \"chairman of everything.\"\n\nOnce in office, Xi proved unwilling to brook criticism. Xi uses Standing Committee and Politburo meetings not as an opportunity to hash out policies but as a chance to deliver hours-long monologues. According to official data, between November 2012 and February 2022, he called for 80 \"collective study sessions,\" in which he spoke at length on a given topic before the Politburo. He rejects any suggestions from subordinates that he thinks will make him look bad. According to an old friend of Wang Qishan, who as a Standing Committee member during Xis first term was part of the inner circle, Wang once proposed that Xis \"eight-point regulation,\" a list of requirements for party members, be made an official party rule. But even this rather sycophantic suggestion was considered an affront by Xi because he had not come up with it himself, and he rebuked Wang on the spot.\n\nXi is also a micromanager. He acts as \"chairman of everything,\" as many analysts have noted. In 2014, for example, he issued instructions on environmental protection 17 timesa remarkable degree of meddling, given all that is on his plate. Deng, Jiang, and Hu recognized that administering a country as vast as China requires taking local complexities into account. They emphasized that cadres at all levels should take instructions from the CCPs Central Committee but adapt them to specific situations as needed. Such flexibility was crucial for economic development, since it gave local officials room to innovate. But Xi insists that his instructions be obeyed to the letter. I know of a county party chief who in 2014 tried to create an exception to the central governments new rules on banquets because his county needed to host delegations of foreign investors. When Xi learned of the attempted innovation, he grew furious, accusing the official of \"speaking ill of the CCP Central Committees policy\"a serious charge that, as a result of this incident, was subsequently codified in the partys disciplinary regulations and is punishable by expulsion.\n\nThe CCP used to have a long tradition, dating back to Mao, in which cadres could write to the top leader with suggestions and even criticisms, but those who dared try this with Xi early in his tenure learned their lesson. Around 2017, Liu Yazhou, a general in the Peoples Liberation Army and a son-in-law of a former president, wrote to Xi recommending that China reverse its policy in Xinjiang and cease rounding up members of the Uyghur minority. He was warned not to speak ill of Xis policies. Xis refusal to accept such counsel removes an important method of self-correction.\n\nWhy, unlike his predecessors, is Xi so resistant to others advice? Part of the reason, I suspect, is that he suffers from an inferiority complex, knowing that he is poorly educated in comparison with other top CCP leaders. Even though he studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University, Xi attended as a \"worker-peasant-soldier,\" a category of students admitted in the 1970s on the basis of political reliability and class background, not their academic merits. Jiang and Hu, by contrast, earned their spots in university through highly competitive exams. In 2002, when Xi was a provincial cadre, he received a doctoral degree in Marxist theory, also at Tsinghua, but as the British journalist Michael Sheridan has documented, Xis dissertation was riddled with instances of suspected plagiarism. As I know from my time at the Central Party School, high-ranking officials routinely farm out their schoolwork to assistants while their professors turn a blind eye. Indeed, at the time he supposedly completed his dissertation, Xi held the busy job of governor of Fujian.\n\nMR. WRONG\n\nIn any political system, unchecked power is dangerous. Detached from reality and freed from the constraint of consensus, a leader can act rashly, implementing policies that are unwise, unpopular, or both. Not surprisingly, then, Xis know-it-all style of rule has led to a number of disastrous decisions. The common theme is an inability to grasp the practical effect of his directives.\n\nConsider foreign policy. Breaking with Dengs dictum that China \"hide its strength and bide its time,\" Xi has decided to directly challenge the United States and pursue a China-centric world order. That is why he has engaged in risky and aggressive behavior abroad, militarizing the South China Sea, threatening Taiwan, and encouraging his diplomats to engage in an abrasive style of foreign policy known as \"Wolf Warrior\" diplomacy. Xi has formed a de facto alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin, further alienating China from the international community. His Belt and Road Initiative has generated growing resistance as countries tire of the associated debt and corruption.\n\nXis economic policies are similarly counterproductive. The introduction of market reforms was one of the CCPs signature achievements, allowing hundreds of millions of Chinese to escape poverty. But when Xi came to power, he came to see the private sector as a threat to his rule and revived the planned economy of the Maoist era. He strengthened state-owned enterprises and established party organizations in the private sector that direct the way businesses are run. Under the guise of fighting corruption and enforcing antitrust law, he has plundered assets from private companies and entrepreneurs. Over the past few years, some of Chinas most dynamic companies, including the Anbang Insurance Group and the conglomerate HNA Group, have effectively been forced to hand over control of their businesses to the state. Others, such as the conglomerate Tencent and the e-commerce giant Alibaba, have been brought to heel through a combination of new regulations, investigations, and fines. In 2020, Sun Dawu, the billionaire owner of an agricultural conglomerate who had publicly criticized Xi for his crackdown on human rights lawyers, was arrested on false charges and soon sentenced to 18 years in prison. His business was sold to a hastily formed state company in a sham auction for a fraction of its true value.\n\nNowhere has Xis desire for control been more disastrous than in his reaction to COVID-19.\n\nPredictably, China has seen its economic growth slow, and most analysts believe it will slow even more in the coming years. Although several factors are at playincluding U.S. sanctions against Chinese tech companies, the war in Ukraine, and the COVID-19 pandemicthe fundamental problem is the CCPs interference in the economy. The government constantly meddles in the private sector to achieve political goals, a proven poison for productivity. Many Chinese entrepreneurs live in fear that their businesses will be seized or that they themselves will be detained, hardly the kind of mindset inclined to innovation. In April, as Chinas growth prospects worsened, Xi hosted a meeting of the Politburo to unveil his remedy for the countrys economic woes: a combination of tax rebates, fee reductions, infrastructure investment, and monetary easing. But since none of these proposals solve the underlying problem of excessive state intervention in the economy, they are doomed to fail.\n\nNowhere has Xis desire for control been more disastrous than in his reaction to COVID-19. When the disease first spread in the city of Wuhan in December 2019, Xi withheld information about it from the public in an attempt to preserve the image of a flourishing China. Local officials, meanwhile, were paralyzed. As Wuhans mayor, Zhou Xianwang, admitted the next month on state television, without approval from above, he had been unable to publicly disclose the outbreak. When eight brave health professionals blew the whistle about it, the government detained and silenced them. One of the eight later revealed that he had been forced to sign a false confession.\n\nA worker closing a barrier to a residential area during a COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai, May 2022 Aly Song / Reuters\n\nXis tendency to micromanage also inhibited his response to the pandemic. Instead of leaving the details of policy to the governments health team, Xi insisted that he himself coordinate Chinas efforts. Later, Xi would boast that he \"personally commanded, planned the response, oversaw the general situation, acted decisively, and pointed the way forward.\" To the extent that this was true, it was not for the better. In fact, his interference led to confusion and inaction, with local health officials receiving mixed messages from Beijing and refusing to act. As I learned from a source on the State Council (Chinas chief administrative authority), Premier Li Keqiang proposed activating an emergency-response protocol in early January 2020, but Xi refused to approve it for fear of spoiling the ongoing Chinese New Year celebrations.\n\nWhen the Omicron variant of the virus surged in Shanghai in February 2022, Xi yet again chose a baffling way to respond. The details of the decision-making process were relayed to me by a contact who works at the State Council. In an online gathering of about 60 pandemic experts held shortly after the outbreak began, everyone agreed that if Shanghai simply followed the latest official guidelines, which relaxed the quarantine requirements, then life in the city could go on more or less as usual. Many of the citys party and health officials were on board with this approach. But when Xi heard about it, he became furious. Refusing to listen to the experts, he insisted on enforcing his \"zero COVID\" policy. Shanghais tens of millions of residents were forbidden from going outside, even to get groceries or receive life-saving health care. Some died at the gates of hospitals; others leaped to their deaths from their apartment buildings.\n\nJust like that, a modern, prosperous city was turned into the site of a humanitarian disaster, with people starving and babies separated from their parents. A leader more open to influence or subject to greater checks would not likely have implemented such a draconian policy, or at least would have corrected course once its costs and unpopularity became evident. But for Xi, backtracking would have been an unthinkable admission of error.\n\nACTION, REACTION\n\nThe CCPs leadership has never been a monolith. As Mao once said, \"There are parties outside our party, and there are factions within our party, and this has always been the case.\" The main organizing principle of these factions is personal ties, but these groups tend to array themselves on a left-to-right continuum. Put differently, although Chinese politics are largely personalistic, there are real differences over the direction of national policy, and each lineage tends to associate itself with the ideas of its progenitor.\n\nOn the left are those who remain committed to orthodox Marxism. This faction dominated the party before the Deng era, and it advocates the continuation of class struggle and violent revolution. It includes subfactions named for Mao, Chen Yun (who was the second most powerful official under Deng), Bo Xilai (a former Politburo member who was sidelined and imprisoned before Xi took power), and Xi himself. At the grassroots level, the left also includes a small, politically powerless contingent of Marxist university students, as well as workers who were laid off as a result of Dengs reforms.\n\nThe center consists mainly of Dengs political descendants. Because most of todays cadres were trained under him, this is the faction that dominates the CCP bureaucracy. Centrists support full-throated economic reforms and limited political reforms, all with the goal of ensuring the partys permanent rule. Also in the center is a group descended from two retired top officials, Jiang and Zeng Qinghong (a former vice president), as well as a group called the Youth League Faction, consisting of supporters of former party leader Hu Jintao and the current premier Li.\n\nLast are the subfactions on the right, which in the Chinese context means liberals who advocate a market economy and a softer form of authoritarianism (or even, in some cases, constitutional democracy). This camp, which I belong to, is the least powerful of the three. It includes followers of Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, party leaders under Deng. It also arguably includes Wen Jiabao, who was Chinas premier from 2003 to 2013 and still wields influence. When asked about his push for political reform in a 2010 interview, Wen responded, \"I will not yield until the last day of my life.\"\n\nWithin the CCP elite, many resent Xis disruption of the traditional power distribution.\n\nXi faces growing opposition from all three factions. The left, while initially supportive of his policies, now thinks he has not gone far enough in reviving Maos policies, with some having become disenchanted after he cracked down on the labor movement. The center resents Xis undoing of economic reforms. And the right has been completely silenced by Xis elimination of even the slightest political debate.\n\nGlimpses of these divides can be seen in the Standing Committee. One member, Han Zheng, is widely perceived as a member of Jiangs faction. Li in particular seems to diverge from Xi, and a row between the officials is breaking out into public view. Li has long quietly opposed Xis zero-COVID policy, stressing the need to reopen businesses and protect the economy. In May, after Li told 100,000 party cadres at an online conference that the economy was in worse shape than expected, Xis allies launched a counterattack. In Xinhua, they defended him by arguing, \"Chinas economic development prospects will definitely be brighter.\" As a symbol of their resistance to Xis COVID policy, Li and his entourage refuse to wear masks. In April, during a speech in the city of Nanchang, Lis aides could be seen asking attendees to remove their masks. So far, Li has taken Xis imperiousness sitting down, always acquiescing out of necessity. But he may soon reach a breaking point.\n\nIndignation at the elite level is replicating itself further down the bureaucracy. Early in Xis tenure, as he began to shuffle power, many in the bureaucracy grew disgruntled and disillusioned. But their resistance was passive, expressed through inaction. Local cadres took sick leave en masse or came up with excuses to stall Xis anticorruption initiatives. At the end of 2021, the CCPs disciplinary commission announced that in the first ten months of that year, it had found 247,000 cases of \"ineffective implementation of Xi Jinpings and the Central Committees important instructions.\" During the Shanghai lockdown, however, resistance became more overt. On social media, local officials openly criticized the zero-COVID policy. In April, members of the residents committee of Sanlin Town, a neighborhood in Shanghai, collectively resigned, complaining in an open letter that they had been sealed in their offices for 24 days with no access to their families.\n\nChinas leader is facing not only internal dissent but also an intense popular backlash.\n\nEven more troubling for Xi, elite dissatisfaction is now spreading to the general public. In an authoritarian state, it is impossible to accurately measure public opinion, but Xis harsh COVID measures may well have lost him the affection of most Chinese. An early note of dissent came in February 2020, when the real estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang called him a \"clown\" for bungling the response to the pandemic. (After a one-day trial, Ren was sentenced to 18 years in prison.) Chinese social media platforms are awash in videos in which ordinary people beg Xi to end his zero-COVID policy. In May, a group calling itself the \"Shanghai Self-Saving Autonomous Committee\" released a manifesto online titled, \"Dont be a slavesave yourself.\" The document called on the citys residents to fight the lockdown and form self-governing bodies to help one another. On social media, some Chinese have sarcastically proposed that the most effective plan for fighting the pandemic would be to convene the 20th National Congress as soon as possible to prevent Xi from staying in power.\n\nMeanwhile, despite Xis claims of having vanquished poverty, most Chinese continue to struggle to make ends meet. As Li revealed in 2020, 600 million people in Chinasome 40 percent of its populationbarely earned $140 a month. According to data obtained by the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, some 4.4 million small businesses closed between January and November 2021, more than three times the number of newly registered companies in the same period. Facing a financial crisis, local governments have been forced to slash government salariessometimes by as much as 50 percent, including pay for teachers. They will likely resort to finding new ways of plundering wealth from the private sector and ordinary citizens, in turn generating even more economic misery. After four decades of opening up, most Chinese dont want to go back to the days of Mao. Within the CCP elite, many resent Xis disruption of the traditional power distribution and think his reckless policies are jeopardizing the future of the party. The result is that for the first time since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Chinas leader is facing not only internal dissent but also an intense popular backlash and a real risk of social unrest.\n\nFIVE MORE YEARS?\n\nHarboring resentment is one thing, but acting on it is another. Members of the partys upper echelons know that they can always be charged with corruption, so they have little incentive to maneuver against Xi. High-tech surveillance is presumed to be so pervasive that party elites, including retired national leaders, do not dare communicate with one another outside official events, even about mundane matters. The public, for its part, stays silent, held back by censorship, surveillance, and the fear of arrest. That is why opponents of Xi are focused on the one legal avenue for removing him: denying him a third term as party leader at the upcoming National Congress.\n\nPerhaps sensing the growing disappointment, Xi has done everything he can to tilt the playing field in his favor. The most important constituency, of course, is his fellow Standing Committee members, who ultimately have the greatest say over whether he stays in office, in part because of their control over members of Chinas legislature. Xi has likely done what he can to ensure the support of Standing Committee members, from promising that they will stay in power to pledging not to investigate their families.\n\nNearly as important is the military, since denying Xi a third term would likely require the support of the generals. Propagandists routinely remind Chinese that \"the party commands the gun,\" but Chinas leaders realize that in truth the gun is always pointed at the partys head. Although Xi has steadily replaced Chinas generals with his own men over the years, military officials rhetoric still wavers between emphasizing personal loyalty to Xi and institutional loyalty to the Central Military Commission, the body, headed by Xi, that oversees them.\n\nIn one potential sign of lingering opposition within the ranks, I learned last December from several of my contacts in China that Liu, the military official whom Xi had rebuked for criticizing policy on the Uyghurshad disappeared along with his younger brother, also a general. Both brothers houses were raided. The news sent shock waves through the military, since as the son-in-law of a former president, Liu would normally have been considered untouchable. But by detaining him and his brother, Xi had issued his strongest warning yet to princelings and the top brass of the Peoples Liberation Army that they should get in line.\n\nChina's Politburo Standing Committee members lining up at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, November 2012 Carlos Barria / Reuters\n\nXi has also ramped up his ostensible anticorruption drive. In the first half of 2022, the government has punished 21 cadres at or above the provincial and ministerial level and 1,237 cadres at the district and departmental level. There has been a distinct focus on the security and intelligence agencies. In January, Chinese state television aired a confession by Sun Lijun, once a high-ranking security official, who had been charged with corruption and now faces the prospect of execution. His sin, according to the partys top disciplinary body, was that he had \"formed a cabal to take control over several key departments,\" \"harbored hugely inflated political ambitions,\" and had \"evil political qualities.\" In March, Fu Zhenghua, who as deputy minister of public security had been Suns boss, was also charged with corruption, removed from office, and expelled from the CCP. The message was clear: obey or risk downfall.\n\nAdding extra layers of insurance to his quest for a third term, Xi has issued a veiled threat to retired party cadres. Party elders have long wielded enormous clout in Chinese politics; it was retired elites who forced out Zhao in 1989, for example. In January, Xi took direct aim at this group, announcing that the government would \"clean up systemic corruption and eliminate hidden risks\" by retroactively investigating the past 20 years of cadres lives. And in May, the party tightened the guidelines for retired cadres, warning them \"not to discuss the general policies of the party Central Committee in an open manner, not to spread politically negative remarks, not to participate in the activities of illegal social organizations, and not to use their former authority or position influence to seek benefits for themselves and others, and to resolutely oppose and resist all kinds of wrong thinking.\"\n\nXi has also sought to guarantee the backing of the 2,300 CCP delegates invited to attend the National Congress, two-thirds of whom are high-level officials from across the country and one-third of whom are ordinary members who work at the grassroots level. The delegates have been carefully screened for their loyalty to Xi. And to prevent any surprises at the congress, a ban on \"nonorganizational activities\" forbids them from mingling outside of formal small-group meetings of their provincial delegations, limiting their ability to organize against a particular policy or leader.\n\nIn the months leading up to the congress, the CCPs stealth infighting will probably intensify. Xi could order more arrests and more trials of high-ranking officials, and his critics could leak more information and spread more rumors. Contrary to the conventional wisdom among Western analysts, he may not have locked up a third term. Xis proliferating opponents could succeed in ushering him out of office, provided they either convince enough Standing Committee members that he has lost the support of the CCPs rank and file or persuade party elders to intervene. And there is always a chance that an economic crisis or widespread social unrest could turn even stalwart allies against him. Despite all this, the most likely outcome this fall is that Xi, having so rigged the process and intimidated his rivals, will get his third term as party leader and, with it, the right to continue as president and head of the military for another term. And just like that, the only meaningful political reform made since Dengs rule will go up in smoke.\n\nXI UNBOUND\n\nWhat then? Xi will no doubt see his victory as a mandate to do whatever he wants to achieve the partys stated goal of rejuvenating China. His ambitions will rise to new heights. In a futile attempt to invigorate the economy without empowering the private sector, Xi will double down on his statist economic policies. To maintain his grip on power, he will continue to preemptively eliminate any potential rivals and tighten social control, making China look increasingly like North Korea. Xi might even try to stay in power well beyond a third term. An emboldened Xi may well accelerate his militarization of disputed areas of the South China Sea and try to forcibly take over Taiwan. As he continues Chinas quest for dominance, he will further its isolation from the rest of the world.\n\nBut none of these moves would make discontent within the party magically disappear. The feat of gaining a third term would not mollify those within the CCP who resent his accumulation of power and reject his cult of personality, nor would it solve his growing legitimacy problem among the people. In fact, the moves he would likely make in a third term would raise the odds of war, social unrest, and economic crisis, exacerbating existing grievances. Even in China, it takes more than sheer force and intimidation to stay in power; performance still matters. Mao and Deng earned their authority through accomplishmentsMao by liberating China from the Nationalists, and Deng by opening it up and unleashing an economic boom. But Xi can point to no such concrete triumphs. He has less margin for error.\n\nThe only viable way of changing course, so far as I can see, is also the scariest and deadliest: a humiliating defeat in a war. If Xi were to attack Taiwan, his likeliest target, there is a good chance that the war would not go as planned, and Taiwan, with American help, would be able to resist invasion and inflict grave damage on mainland China. In that event, the elites and the masses would abandon Xi, paving the way for not only his personal downfall but perhaps even the collapse of the CCP as we know it. For precedent, one would have to go back to the eighteenth century, when Emperor Qianlong failed in his quest to expand Chinas realm to Central Asia, Burma, and Vietnam. Predictably, China suffered a mortifying loss in the First Sino-Japanese War, setting the stage for the downfall of the Qing dynasty and kicking off a long period of political upheaval. Emperors are not always forever.",

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The brave move by the Smolninsky District Council drew a predictably swift and unfriendly reaction. A day after the resolution against Putin was made public, a local police station told the lawmakers they were facing legal charges \"due to actions aimed at discrediting the current Russian government.\"\n\nThe district councils statement came in the form of a request to the Russian parliament, the State Duma, and asserted that Putins decision to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24 led to a massive loss of life, turned countless Russian men into disabled veterans, hindered the national economy, and fast-tracked NATOs eastward expansion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA second municipal council in Moscows Lomonosovsky district followed suit and voted on a similar motion calling on Putin to resign. Outspoken criticism of Putin is rare, and while the two motions were little more than symbolic statements, they represented a remarkable public rebuke. They also served as evidence that public support for the war in Ukraine is not universal, and could be eroding as a recent survey of Russian public opinion found.\n\n\"We believe that the decision made by President Putin to start the special military operation is detrimental to the security of Russia and its citizens,\" the Smolninsky document filed on Wednesday evening said.\n\n\"We ask you,\" the lawmakers wrote, \"to initiate a treason charge against the president of the Russian Federation to remove him from office.\"\n\nPutin grew up in the Smolninsky neighborhood and began his career in St. Petersburg, where he served as a deputy mayor. Many of the Russian presidents closest friends still live in St. Petersburg where some of them have grown fabulously wealthy during Putins 22 years as the countrys supreme leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe State Duma is controlled by Putins United Russia party and is effectively his rubber stamp, at times adopting his policies by unanimous vote.\n\nThe resolutions authors conceded that they had little hope their request would be acted but that they believed they achieved their largely symbolic goal: to let other antiwar Russians know that they are not alone in their sentiment, which is often drowned out by the states militaristic rhetoric, echoed by propagandists on state-controlled television.\n\nThe Kremlin has outlawed criticism of the war, and has initiated a further crackdown on dissent, including from journalists.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\"We understand that Putin wont shed a tear and stop the operation,\" Nikita Yuferev, one of the seven councilors who wrote the document, said in an interview with The Washington Post. \"These requests are written for people who are still in Russia and for whom the propaganda tries to assure that they are the minority, that there are no people who are against this.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lomonosovsky districts statement slammed Putins rhetoric and urged him to step side.\n\n\"The rhetoric you and your subordinates use is full of intolerance and aggression,\" the statement said. \"People once again fear and hate Russia while we threaten the whole world with nuclear weapons.\" The Lomonosovsky district added: \"Therefore, we ask for you to be relieved of your duties as your views and governance model are hopelessly outdated.\"\n\nYuferev said that after their request went viral on Russian social media, the councilors received a \"flurry\" of letters of support from people offering anything from legal help to donations to cover the fines that will likely be imposed on the politicians.\n\nIn March, the Smolninsky councilors also wrote a letter to Putin urging him to stop the war as \"the fate of thousands of Russian servicemen and millions Ukrainians are at stake.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly, after Russian troops marched across the border, the Kremlin dialed up the level of the repressions against its opponents, outlawing the use of the word \"war\" when talking about the invasion and threatening those who publicly criticize the Russian army with fines and jail terms. Thousands fled the country, and hundreds have been fined or detained for antiwar demonstrations.\n\nWhile Putin is unlikely to face any charges, the lawmakers are already under pressure and face at least a fine.\n\nJust a day after the document went public, Yuferev received a text message from a local police station ordering him to come in to testify in proceedings launched against him and other council members \"due to actions aimed at discrediting the current Russian government.\"",

FRANCE 24 spoke to Ksenia Torstrem, a municipal deputy for the St. Petersburg district and one of the leading petitioners demanding Putins resignation.\n\nRussia's President Vladimir Putin speaks with acting governor of Kirov region via a video call at the Kremlin in Moscow on August 9, 2022.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe petition, signed initially by 19 local Russian elected officials and published on Monday, contains a brief text that condemns Putins invasion of Ukraine and demands that he step down.\n\n\"We, the municipal deputies of Russia, believe that the actions of President Vladimir Putin are harming the future of the country and its citizens. We demand the resignation of Vladimir Putin from the post of president of the Russian Federation,\" states the petition, which has been circulated widely on social networks and been picked up by several media outlets.\n\nIt is a striking show of opposition in a country where the Kremlins harsh crackdown on dissent has meant Putin is rarely denigrated publicly. Since the start of the conflict, those who criticise the president risk jail time due to a law that criminalises the publication of \"fake news\" on the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHowever the conflict in Ukraine or the \"special military operation\", as Moscow calls it is not going as planned for the Kremlin. Amid Moscows setbacks and Ukraines counter-offensive successes, there is mounting criticism among those in Russia opposed to the war.\n\nDespite the risks of speaking out, another 84 signatures have been added to the petition since its publication, though Torstrem is still confirming the numbers.\n\nBefore the launch of the petition, several elected officials from a district of St. Petersburg Putin's hometown had gone even further by sending a letter to the Duma on September 7, demanding that the president not only be removed from office but also tried for \"treason\".\n\nFRANCE 24 spoke to Ksenia Torstrem, a municipal councillor from St. Petersburg and one of the leading voices behind the September 12 petition calling for Putin's resignation.\n\nFRANCE 24: Why did you choose to launch a petition against Vladimir Putin at this time?\n\nKsenia Torstrem: We wanted to express our support for our friends from Smolninskoye (the St. Petersburg district whose elected officials called for Vladimir Putin to be tried for treason).\n\nWe admire their courage and can only regret the trouble they are now having with the police, who accuse them of discrediting the armed forces.\n\nLocal elected officials consulted each other to find out what we could do to express our solidarity. And in the current context it is not easy, without risking trouble with the authorities.\n\nSo we thought that a petition was the safest way. It is not against the law to sign a petition in Russia.\n\nIsn't a petition calling on Putin to resign dangerous in itself?\n\nThere is nothing that prohibits it. But then, you never know what to expect from the government at the moment. That's why I was chosen as a spokesperson for the petitioners, because I left Russia for Finland at the start of the conflict. Im risking less than other colleagues who have chosen to stay.\n\nBut it is clear that even signing such a petition is frightening. When we started circulating the text on Telegram to ask other elected officials to sign, there were a number who admitted that they were afraid to do so, especially because they have children. Others refused because they felt that there was no point in taking such a risk for a petition that they felt would have no impact.\n\nWhat is your objective, do you really think that Putin could decide to resign?\n\nWhy not? To resign would be a way for Vladimir Putin to leave power peacefully.\n\nAnd such a petition is important, also, in the midst of the current propaganda. Everything is done to make people believe that there is no criticism of the governments policies. In fact, there are millions of Russians who do not agree [with Putin], and such a petition signals to them that they are not alone.\n\nPerhaps there are also some people in the elite who would like to launch impeachment proceedings against Vladimir Putin. We also want to show them that they have support at the local level.\n\nDo you think that with more than 60 signatures, your petition is a success?\n\nIt is not bad. Of course, if you compare it with other petitions that, at the beginning of the fighting, had gathered many more signatures opposing the conflict, it may seem low.\n\nHowever, we have received signatures from local politicians from all over the country from St. Petersburg, Moscow, Irkutsk and Vladivostok.\n\nThe text of your petition is very short and does not go into detail about the grievances against Vladimir Putin. What do you accuse him of?\n\nI don't really know ... I'm not sure I can answer this question without getting into trouble.\n\nBut I have been opposing Vladimir Putin for a long time, and I have been denouncing the corruption in the country. Our petition is also about supporting the authors of the letter calling for Vladimir Putin to stand trial. And they have stated the reasons for their actions... *\n\n*The petition levies four main accusations at Putin, namely that the invasion has resulted in: the unnecessary destruction of Russian combat units; the deaths of young Russian citizens, who could have otherwise contributed to economic development; economic instability; Ukraine now being better equipped militarily than ever after receiving modern arms from NATO, despite one of Russias stated goals being the \"demilitarisation\" of Ukraine.\n\nThis article has been translated from the original in French.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

The situation worsens due to the general attitude toward their own wounded.

The United Nations International Childrens Emergency Fund (UNICEF) says they have lost track of that at least 26,000 children who, instead of being moved within Ukraines orphanage system, were reunited with their parents and legal guardians once Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The United Nations worry that the lack record-keeping and follow-up by Ukrainian officials can put orphaned children at risk of violence, exploitation and human trafficking. Ukraines National Social Service (NSS), tasked with overseeing childrens rights, said it had done \"everything possible to preserve the lives and health of children and prevent them from being left in the epicenter of hostilities.\" It said that support for families is provided by specialized social services, and that it was working to resolve problems,\" Reuters reports.

More from the story: Liberated Kharkiv Oblast residents from Zaliznychne told the Washington Post that Russians dropped their weapons on the ground when they fled, with some jumping onto stolen bicycles, trying to pass for locals. Vehicular losses were also great. Many pictures of Kharkiv Oblast showed abandoned Russian assets ranging from main battle tanks to engineering vehicles, self-propelled mortars and supply trucks. Analyst Jakub Janovsky estimated that Russia lost a total of 336 fighting vehicles in the country from Sept. 7-11. A full 102 vehicles were lost on Sept. 11 alone, most of them in Kharkiv Oblast.\" Read the rest of Kyiv Independents reporting here.

I am Aben Clayton and will be taking over the blog for the next hour. The impact of recent counteroffensive operations seems to have swung the pendulum in favor of Ukrainian forces, though it remains unclear how much their gains will impact the ultimate trajectory of the more than six month conflict. Other notable happenings from the war include: The United States assesses that Russia has largely ceded its gains near Kharkiv and many retreating Russian soldiers have exited Ukraine , moving over the border back into Russia, a senior US military official said on Monday, Reuters reports.\n\nThe Ukrainian authorities have said they are capturing so many prisoners of war among Russian soldiers retreating from occupation of the north-eastern region that the country is running out of space to put them , the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe military command of the Russian federation has stopped sending new units into Ukraine following a dramatic Ukrainian counter-offensive that has reshaped the war and left Moscow reeling, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said Monday.\n\nMunicipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg have signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign. \"We, the municipal deputies of Russia, believe that the actions of President V.

Overall we assess the Ukrainians are making progress as they fight to liberate and reclaim territory in the south and east. On the ground in the vicinity of Kharkiv we assess that Russian forces have largely ceded their gains to the Ukrainians and have withdrawn to the north and east. Many of these forces have moved over the border into Russia,\" the US military official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity, without offering a number. Well bring more details on this shortly. NEW: Russia's low troop morale, logistics issues, and the inability to sustain operations helped contribute to losses of occupied territory to Ukraine in Kharkiv region in recent days: senior U.S. military official Jack Detsch (@JackDetsch) September 12, 2022 Heres another voice. #Ukraine has presented #Russia|n forces w/\"multiple dilemmas\" per senior US military official\n\nRussia's ceding ground in #Kharkiv area \"indicative\" of morale & other issues, per the official Jeff Seldin (@jseldin) September 12, 2022\n\nUpdated at 16.02 EDT\n\n12 Sept 2022 15.32 EDT The Ukrainian authorities have said they are capturing so many prisoners of war among Russian soldiers retreating from occupation of the north-eastern region that the country is running out of space to put them, the Associated Press reports. As Ukrainian troops retook a wide swath of territory from Russia on Monday, pushing all the way back to the north-eastern border in some places, it was not yet clear if the Ukrainian blitz could signal a turning point in the war. Momentum has switched back and forth before, but rarely with such a big and sudden swing. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich did not specify the number of Russian prisoners but said the POWs would be exchanged for Ukrainian service members held by Moscow. Military intelligence spokesman Andrey Yusov said the captured troops included \"significant\" numbers of Russian officers. Ukraines deputy interior minister accused fleeing Russian forces of burning official documents and concealing bodies in an attempt to cover up rights violations in the areas they controlled until last week. Here is some footage with subtitles (and a warning of blurred images of bodies) tweeted by the UKs Sky News from its reporter in Zaliznychne, which the channel explains is a rural village that was occupied after the Russian invasion and until three days ago. Sky's Deborah Haynes was granted access to Zaliznychne, a rural village that three days earlier was occupied by the Russians.\n\nResidents there spoke of relief that they have gone - and gave rare testimony about what has been unfolding.\n\nMore here: https://t.co/X3flQUBL0r pic.twitter.com/XOy6EdtBQC Sky News (@SkyNews) September 12, 2022\n\nUpdated at 15.47 EDT\n\n12 Sept 2022 14.41 EDT Theres more detail from Ukraines advance to the Russian border, as reported by the Associated Press, quoting residents of the Kharkiv region. \"The Russians were here in the morning. Then at noon, they suddenly started shouting wildly and began to run away, charging off in tanks and armored vehicles,\" Dmytro Hrushchenko, a resident of Zaliznychne, a small town near the eastern front line, said. Oleh Syniehubov, the governor of Kharkiv region, said that \"in some areas of the front, our defenders reached the state border with the Russian Federation\". And a spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence said Russian troops were surrendering en masse as \"they understand the hopelessness of their situation\". Video taken by the Ukrainian military showed soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over battle-damaged buildings. In one scene, a fighter wiped his boots on a Russian flag on the ground. Other videos showed Ukrainians inspecting the wreckage of Russian military vehicles, including tanks. Efforts to disarm landmines were under way in the recaptured areas, along with a search for any remaining Russian troops, Ukrainian military officials said.\n\nUpdated at 14.56 EDT\n\n12 Sept 2022 14.00 EDT Summary It is 9pm in Ukraine. The military command of the Russian federation has stopped sending new units into Ukraine following a dramatic Ukrainian counter-offensive that has reshaped the war and left Moscow reeling, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said Monday. This information could not be corroborated. The Kremlin has yet to respond.\n\nMunicipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg have signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign. \"We, the municipal deputies of Russia, believe that the actions of President V. V. Putin harm the future of Russia and its citizens. We demand the resignation of Vladimir Putin from the post of President of the Russian Federation!\" read the statement published by Ksenia Torstrem, the municipal deputy of the Semenovsky district of St Petersburg.\n\nUkrainian forces have gained significant ground these past few days, particularly in the Kharkiv region . Today, it appears they continued to make great strides, reaching the border at one more location in the Kharkiv region: near the village of Ternova.\n\nMeanwhile, just today, Russia launched five missile strikes, more than 10 airstrikes and more than 20 attacks from rocket systems on military and civilian targets in Ukraine, the general staff of the countrys armed forces said. After knocking out the power and water supply once again to the Kharkiv region with earlier missile strikes, Russian forces continued its offensive on the city, this time directing its shelling toward the residential Nemyshlyansky district.\n\nAuthorities found the bodies of four tortured civilians in the recently recaptured Kharkiv town of Zaliznychne , the Ukrainian prosecutor generals office said. The discovery is an echo of the war crimes uncovered after Ukrainian troops retook Bucha and other areas around Kyiv.\n\nRussian soldiers engaged in mass looting as they fled Kharkiv oblast, the defence intelligence unit of Ukraines defence ministry said. Soldiers loaded \"generators, telephones and computers taken from Ukrainians into their cars. Rare cases of school robberies have been recorded, even horizontal bars and sports equipment were taken out of gyms\".",

But amid repeated setbacks in a catastrophic war in Ukraine, his inflexible approach is looking more like his great flaw. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight As Russian forces fled in disarray in Ukraines Kharkiv region Saturday dressing as civilians, stealing bicycles, abandoning tons of military equipment and ammunition Putin sounded strikingly tone deaf as he opened a giant new Ferris wheel in Moscow. \"There is nothing like that in Europe,\" he boasted via video-link.\n\nWithin hours, the Ferris wheel had broken down, and tickets had to be refunded. Repairing whats broken about Putins war strategy and, by extension, his presidency and reputation, will be far harder.\n\nUkraines northeastern counteroffensive was underway even as Putin, at a conference in the Far East days earlier, insisted that Russia had \"lost nothing and will lose nothing\" in the war, a remark that seemed oblivious to Russias repeated setbacks and shockingly high casualties, and ignorant of what was transpiring on the battlefield.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutins spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday that the war \"will continue until the goals that have been set are achieved.\" What those goals are, however, is difficult to know. Putins initial goal, of capturing Kyiv and toppling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskys government, failed.\n\nNow, Western intelligence and military analysts argue Russia is unlikely to achieve its presumed fallback goal of conquering all of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.\n\nPresuming that Putins goal involves being able to declare victory in some form, the messy Russian retreat from Kharkiv what Moscow called a \"regroup\" now leaves the 69-year-old president with stark and shrinking choices.\n\nUkrainian forces recaptured most of the Kharkiv region. Despite setbacks, the Kremlin insists that the war will continue on Sept. 12. (Video: Reuters)\n\nHe could scale-up and announce a politically risky national mandatory military mobilization something Peskov on Tuesday denied was even under discussion. He could grind on, plowing in poorly trained and increasingly de-motivated soldiers, and carrying out brutal artillery attacks on towns and cities to terrorize the Ukrainian population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, he could escalate in some extreme fashion, as some of Putins fiercest critics fear, turning to chemical or even nuclear weapons.\n\nSo far, Putin has done everything he can to avoid mandatory mobilization, which risks triggering wider public opposition to the war even though many Russian military experts believe there is no other way to defeat Ukraine militarily.\n\nAnd while deploying a weapon of mass destruction cannot be ruled out, many experts play down fears of Putin doing so, because it would destroy his dwindling international support with crucial partners like China and India, and because it would undermine his efforts to convey a sense of normalcy to Russians.\n\nIf Putin sticks to his habit of refusing to back down, analysts say, he is most likely to grind on.\n\n\"Vladimir Putin certainly has the will to continue this war, but he has been largely operating under the illusion that the Russian military was winning and would eventually win,\" said Michael Kofman, director of Russian studies at Arlington-based Center for Naval Analyses, or CNA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The question is, is he willing to take the political risk to try to salvage the Russian military effort in this war?\" Kofman said, referring to mandatory mobilization.\n\n\"Many Russians have been fairly lukewarm in terms of either supporting or not caring about this war, seeing their lives as largely unaffected because they believe that their kids will not be sent to fight,\" Kofman added. \"Peoples attitudes really change if they think their kids will be sent to fight.\"\n\nNor is either side ready to discuss peace. Dmitry Medvedev, Russian deputy head of the Security Council, said Monday the war would not end without Kyivs \"total capitulation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Zelensky speaks with increasing boldness about taking back not only all of the eastern Donbas region, but also Crimea, which Russia annexed illegally in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut grinding on poses its own risks to Putin, who is coming under increasing pressure and scrutiny despite a Kremlin crackdown on criticism of the war.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAfter Russia admitted the retreat Saturday, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov suggested that Putin might not be aware of the mistakes that had been made, and would have to call the president himself to discuss the situation. Peskov on Monday insisted Putin is fully briefed.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry claimed Saturday that the \"regrouping\" took place without a single loss for Russia, and with some 4,000 Ukrainians killed, assertions not supported by the facts.\n\nThat night, as fireworks burst across the capital in celebration of Moscow City Day, the hard-line pro-war faction, aware of the actual scale of the losses, was livid. They demanded harsher military action, the targeting of civilian infrastructure and mandatory military mobilization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile opposition deputies in 35 municipalities signed calls in recent days for Putin to be removed, a rare sign of symbolic public dissent. They now are likely to face tough consequences.\n\nMost ordinary Russians, no longer paying much attention to the war, were probably unaware of the big retreat, analysts said. But if Russia faces more setbacks, the outrage from pro-war hard-liners could sharpen, public awareness would rise and, with it, pressure on Putin.\n\nWith complaints about the \"difficulties\" and \"mistakes\" being voiced on state television and by prominent figures like Kadyrov, it is becoming harder to maintain the Kremlin line that everything is going according to plan.\n\nPutin, however, seems to be stubbornly sticking to the same strategy, banking on his conviction that Western support for Ukraine will crumple, forcing Ukraine to capitulate in time. This already seems to be backfiring, with Ukraines recent gains capturing imaginations, reinforcing support for Kyiv.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn some ways, Putin is a victim of his own policies. The Kremlin for years has fostered a large group of politically apathetic citizens, making it difficult now to take firmer steps to win the war, such as mobilization, which require patriotic fervor to avoid a political backlash.\n\nSociologist Boris Kagarlitsky said the loyal but passive mass of Russian citizens which he puts at up to 80 percent saw themselves as \"outside politics,\" and are focused on their own lives, seeing the war as none of their business.\n\n\"These people do not trust television, but they do not trust the internet either,\" Kagarlitsky said. \"So television propaganda doesnt work on them, but any kind of antiwar propaganda or opposition discourse doesnt work on them either, because they just do not turn on anything that has to do with politics or economic issues or general values or anything that doesnt affect them directly.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnline, such citizens seek out videos about hunting, fishing, cooking, fashion shows, animals, and similar, he said. Under Putin, \"a good citizen is a passive citizen, who is not getting himself or herself involved in anything.\"\n\nPolitical analyst Tatiana Stanovaya founder of R. Politik analytical group, said even as failures and pressure from the hard-line pro-war lobby mounted, Putin was reluctant to risk upsetting the passive masses, particularly given opinion polls showing declining interest in the war.\n\nInstead the Kremlin was carefully maintaining the narrative there was no war, just a \"special military operation\" where everything is going to plan and life, for most, can continue on as normal.\n\n\"I dont see that he can radically pivot to review this understanding of the situation,\" said Stanovaya, who is based in France, adding that mobilization was unlikely. \"He bets that the West will fall apart with time. Ukraine will give up, one day. So today we had to retreat to spare manpower, but tomorrow Ukraine will sign a capitulation and all this will not matter, in Putins vision.\"\n\nBut she added this approach required Russias elite to blindly follow Putins vision of a Russian victory cementing its place as a great power in a multipolar world, without knowing how this would happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is his stake, but he cant explain it to the elites, because its nonsense. You just cant be convincing about it. This is why he doesnt really speak about it. He doesnt explain how he is going to win,\" she said, adding there was \"a growing problem\" with Putins leadership.",

Sputnik/Gavriil Grigorov/Pool via REUTERS\n\nReuters\n\nMoscow: A group of St Petersburg local politicians who called for President Vladimir Putin to be sacked over the war in Ukraine faces the likely dissolution of their district council following a judge's ruling on Tuesday, one of the deputies said.\n\nNikita Yuferev said the judge decided that a series of past council meetings had been invalid, paving the way for it to be broken up by the regional governor.\n\nAnother council member, Dmitry Palyuga, said the same court then fined him 47,000 roubles ($780) for \"discrediting\" the authorities by calling for Putin's removal. Court officials could not be reached by telephone for comment.\n\nFour more members of the Smolninskoye local council are due to appear in court in the next two days.\n\nLast week, a group of deputies from the council appealed to the State Duma to bring charges of state treason against Putin and strip him of power, citing a series of reasons including Russia's military losses in Ukraine and the damage to its economy from Western sanctions.\n\nAnother local deputy said 65 municipal representatives from St Petersburg, Moscow and several other regions had signed a petition she published on Monday calling for Putin's resignation.\n\nWhile posing no current threat to Putin's grip on power, the moves mark rare expressions of dissent by elected representatives at a time when Russians risk heavy prison sentences for \"discrediting\" the armed forces or spreading \"deliberately false information\" about them.\n\nPalyuga told Reuters before Tuesday's hearing that the group's appeals were aimed not only at liberal Russians but also at \"people loyal to the authorities who are starting to have doubts when they see the lack of success of the Russian army\".\n\nHe said he expected the numbers of such people to increase after last week's lightning counter-offensive in which Ukraine drove Russian forces out of dozens of towns and recaptured a large swathe of territory in its northeast Kharkiv region.\n\n\"Of course, what is happening now has successfully coincided with our agenda. Many people who liked Putin are starting to feel betrayed. I think the more successfully the Ukrainian army operates, the more such people will become,\" he said.\n\nRussian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said the greater risk to the Kremlin lay not in the councillors' protest itself but in the danger of responding too harshly to it.\n\n\"The reaction, or overreaction, may cause more political damage to the regime than this petition. But I have no doubts that all those who signed the petition will (come) under political pressure,\" said Stanovaya, founder of the independent analysis project R.Politik.\n\nThousands of legal cases have been launched against people accused of discrediting the army, usually leading to fines for first-time offences, but a Moscow district councillor was jailed for seven years in July after being convicted of spreading false information. Several other journalists and opposition figures have been charged and face potential prison terms. [\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that critical points of view were tolerated, within the limits of the law. \"As long as they remain within the law, this is pluralism, but the line is very, very thin, one must be very careful here,\" he said.\n\nKsenia Thorstrom, a St Petersburg local councillor who published Monday's petition calling for Putin's resignation, said it was too early to say how the campaign would turn out.\n\n\"To call for a politician to resign is absolutely normal. There can be nothing criminal about it,\" she told Reuters.\n\n\"Of course there is a certain risk, but to show solidarity with our colleagues - independent politicians who still remain in Russia - is much more important.\"",

                "cc_text": "Iran's strategy in the Middle East is essentially a take on an old proverb: Give your proxies and partners weapons and you can sustain their battles for a day. Teach them to make weapons and they can fight your enemies for a lifetime.\n\nWith Iranian-backed militant groups taking the charge in the Islamic republic's fight against Israel and the United States, Tehran is seeing its effort to help them acquire their own weapons-manufacturing capabilities pay off.\n\n\"Iran has established a network of allies and partners throughout the Middle East, from the Huthis in Yemen, to pro-Iranian groups in Iraq, to pro-Iranian groups in Syria, to Hizballah in Lebanon, to Hamas in Gaza,\" said Samuel Bendett of the Virginia-based Center for Naval Analyses. \"And [Tehran] basically feeds some of its technology there directly, or provides kits and parts and other assistance to the local developers from those units, from those groups, and either gives them training in Iran or trains them on their location.\"\n\nIncreasingly, those Tehran-backed militant groups are turning to weapons they have produced themselves, often based on Iranian blueprints or manufactured or assembled with Iran's assistance. \"Those groups now have a lot of know-how which was provided to them by Iran,\" Bendett said. \"And they're now using them against the U.S. and its allies in the region.\"\n\nThe Iranian-backed Islamic Resistance Movement -- better known as Hamas and considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union -- utilized a vast array of indigenously produced weapons and employed advanced battlefield tactics during its surprise multipronged attack on Israel on October 7 that left around 1,200 people dead.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces said they recovered Iranian-manufactured mortars and explosives used by the Palestinian extremist group after the assault, and Israeli military officials have reportedly estimated that up to 10 percent of the weapons used in the attack were made in Iran.\n\nBut most were produced or refined by Hamas indigenously in the Gaza Strip, including assault rifles, missiles, rockets, mortars, shells, and ammunition, according to Israeli defense officials.\n\nSome of the at least 19 Iranian proxies and partners in the region that help make up Iran's so-called axis of resistance have also used Iranian-derived or indigenously manufactured weapons built with Tehran's help against Israel as well as U.S. troops based in the region since the Hamas assault.\n\nThese militant groups boast varying levels of firepower in their respective arsenals made up of Soviet-era, Russian, Iranian, and indigenously manufactured weapons based on Iranian designs. While Iran denies delivering arms to the groups directly, many of the missiles, rockets, and other weapons are similar to those produced by Iran.\n\nLebanese Hizballah boasts the most formidable arsenal of projectiles among Tehran's proxies -- including its own manufactured or refitted missiles and rockets. Since October 7, Hizballah has launched hundreds of rockets and missiles at Israel.\n\nThe Iranian-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen claim to have launched ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones, at Israel. On November 8, the Pentagon announced that a U.S. military surveillance drone was shot down off the coast of Yemen by Huthi forces.\n\nIn an apparent response to U.S. support for Israel's retaliatory land invasion and aerial bombardment of the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria have launched 58 attacks against U.S. forces in the past month, according to the Pentagon.\n\nTehran has denied involvement in the Hamas attack, and in early November Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reportedly pressed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh to silence those calling for Iran and Lebanese Hizballah to join the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAccording to sources cited by Reuters, Khamenei said during the meeting with Haniyeh in Tehran that Iran would continue to offer political and moral support but would not directly enter the conflict.\n\nBut Iran has publicly boasted about the military aid it has provided to Hamas in recent years. And despite international sanctions and a sea and land blockade on the Gaza Strip that was imposed by Israel and Egypt in 2005, experts say it is clear that Tehran has provided assistance to boost Hamas's fighting capabilities.\n\nMiddle East political analyst Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib told RFE/RL that Hamas built up its arsenal by looting weapons from former stockpiles of the Palestinian Authority or illegally purchasing them decades ago from Israeli sources through straw-man sales, smuggling arms and materials across the border with Egypt, and domestically producing drones, rockets, and various munitions.\n\nBut there is little evidence that any seaborne smuggling of arms has taken place since Hamas took power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, he said. And the smuggling from Egypt that reached its height after the Egyptian revolution in 2011 declined sharply after the Muslim Brotherhood government there was overthrown in 2013 and has since \"been reduced to a trickle.\"\n\nNevertheless, Alkhatib said, \"the weaponry and the arsenal that Hamas has right now has been building up for over a decade\" and benefited from thousands of tons of smuggled arms and materials that could be used to manufacture its own weapons.\n\n\"Even if the smuggling stopped, those are still significant and vast enough to offer Hamas and other groups the ability to inflict damage as we saw on October 7 and as we're seeing in their defensive battle with advancing Israeli ground troops,\" said Alkhatib, a U.S. citizen from Gaza.\n\nWhereas Hamas historically focused on building up a stockpile of rifles and machine guns, he says, it turned its attention to developing kinetic capabilities -- including mines, targeted explosive warheads, improvised explosive devices, anti-tank missiles, and rocket propelled grenades.\n\nHamas has also invested heavily in developing longer-range rockets and guidance and targeting capabilities as well as a range of unmanned aerial vehicles, including fixed-wing and weaponized commercial-grade drones.\n\nHamas had a falling out with Tehran, including over the extremist group's support of the Syrian uprising in 2011, Alkhatib says. But Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's leader in Gaza, realigned the organization with Tehran \"because they have realized that without Iran, their military capability won't stand a chance in continuing to evolve.\"\n\nThe realignment \"with Iran, with the Syrian regime, and certainly with [Lebanese] Hizballah,\" he added, \"are directly related to Hamas's needs and reliance on Iran to procure materials and, more importantly in the era of limited to no smuggling, technologies and know-how to domestically produce [weapons] systems.\"\n\nAided by Iranian weapons blueprints and the use of modern digital platforms for remote training, Hamas has learned how to upgrade old rockets and missiles to expand their range and lethality, he said.\n\nIran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Lebanese Hizballah have also been able to remotely teach Hamas fighting tactics and how to develop its massive tunnel network. \"And, more importantly, Iran is also teaching Hamas how to use strategic capabilities,\" Alkhatib said, such as how to integrate drones on the battlefield.\n\n\"What was particularly spectacular about the October 7 attack,\" Alkhatib said, \"is that Hamas for the first time demonstrated a combined-arms approach to guerrilla warfare, whereby intelligence was linked with the artillery barrage, was linked with the aerial capabilities of using the paragliders, was linked with the ground troops with the elite forces, with the logistical networks to transport the hostages back to Gaza and to send the attacks in waves with internal operational security.\n\n\"This was a qualitative leap forward in Hamas's fighting doctrine. And it could have only been learned and developed through assistance from Iran, broadly, and more specifically, its proxies and its arms in the region such as Hizballah and the IRGC,\" he added.\n\nElsewhere in the Middle East, Iran's support for proxies and its involvement in the Syrian civil war now leaves it with a significant number of experienced fighters at the ready for future conflicts.\n\nAlkhatib notes that Iran supported hundreds of thousands of Shi'ite militias and fighters in Iraq and Syria, both to support the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and to combat the Islamic State (IS) extremist group alongside Syrian and Iraqi government forces.\n\n\"Now that both have been largely defeated, IS and the Syrian rebels, Iran was left with these powerful, battle-hardened, well-trained, well-organized militias that had nothing to do,\" Alkhatib said. \"And so, they have been recycled and repurposed by the IRGC to further bolster the so-called axis of resistance, and to be used in a potential fight with Israel and the United States.\"",

But pronouncing it in connection with Ukraine can still result in a fine or even prison. \"Its a war, not a special operation. We need a general mobilization,\" said Gennady Andreyevich Zyuganov, the leader of the Communist Party historically the bastion of Vladimir Putins support. The rapid advance of Ukrainian troops in the last week has caused a commotion in Russia. The presidents entourage is attempting to put out the fire within its ranks. Putins spokesperson has even issued a warning: any criticism, whether from the opposition or from ultranationalists, will be subject to prosecution. This week, the Saint Petersburg councilors who requested the leaders impeachment will go to court.\n\n\"A war and a special operation have different roots. You can stop a special operation, but you cannot stop a war even if you try. This has two results: victory or defeat. Winning the [eastern region of] Donbas is a question of historic survival. Everyone in this country should really value what is happening,\" Zyuganov told the Russian parliament on Tuesday. The 78-year-old politician, who has been at the head of the party since 1993, used a term banned by the laws against \"discrediting\" the Russian armed forces. As a result of these laws, the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, whose director Dmitri Muratov won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, was forced to delete news stories that described events in Ukraine as a war.\n\nAmidst the clamor unleashed by Zyuganovs pointed message, the Communist Party distanced itself from its leaders statement. \"[Zyuganov] called for mobilizing the economy and the political system, not for mobilizing the countrys population,\" said his press secretary, Alexander Yushchenko, in a subsequent interview where he called for \"severe punishment for those who share these provocations.\" By then, a good part of the Russian media had already echoed the words of the Communist leader.\n\nThe head of the Communist Party was a key player in September 2021, when he swiftly put an end to some party members allegations that Putins party, United Russia, had stolen the parliamentary elections through the new electronic voting system. Valeri Rashki, the Moscow Communist leader who had encouraged the demonstrations in the capital, was removed shortly thereafter due to a scandal involving illegal hunting and drunk driving.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier stands on an abandoned Russian tank on the edge of Izyum, in the Kharkiv region. JUAN BARRETO (AFP)\n\nDemands for a general mobilization now have reached Putins own party. \"Without full mobilization, including the economy, we will not achieve the proper results. The fact is that society should be as united as possible and ready for victory,\" said Mikhail Sheremet, member of the Duma Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, on Monday.\n\nThe Kremlin has warned that it will not tolerate internal dissent. \"Critical points of view, as long as they remain within the law, this is pluralism, but the line is very, very thin, one must be very careful here,\" the Russian presidents spokesperson, Dmitri Peskov, said on Tuesday in response to questions about the recent wave of criticism.\n\nThe spokesperson denied that it is in Putins plans to order a mobilization, despite the anger in circles of power over the troops loss of territories recovered by Ukraine. \"At the present time, no, it is not being discussed,\" said Peskov. The Chechen president, Ramzan Kadirov, denounced that cities had been \"given away.\" A few propaganda officials urged \"punishment or execution\" for the commanders responsible for the disaster.\n\nOpposition on trial\n\nThe rest of the critics, which now include 65 councilors from major Russian cities who are demanding Putins removal from office, come from the political opposition. Banned in national parliament, this sector has managed to use municipal councils to stay involved in politics. Its biggest splash was made on September 7 in the Saint Petersburg district of Smolninskoye, when a group of councilors asked the Duma to consider removing Putin from power because of the offensive on Ukraine. This Tuesday a trial took place against Dmitri Paligua, the first of the five councilors, who stood accused of having discredited the president. The court sentenced him to pay a fine of 47,000 rubles, around 780, a measure that is more of a warning than a punishment.\n\nThe councilors initiative has received support from politicians all over Russia, from the capital to the far east of the country. \"We currently have 54 signatures. It is a relative success. I remember that at the beginning of the offensive, we gathered 200 signatures against it. The number has diminished, people are afraid, but its a good number,\" said Ksenia Tsortrem, a politician from another Saint Petersburg district and a supporter of the petition, over the phone. Several hours later, the number had grown to 65.\n\n\"It is a way to show our solidarity and that we arent afraid,\" she says. When asked about Peskovs assertion that Russia has political pluralism, she laughs. \"No, I dont agree. It hasnt existed for a long time. There have been new elections in Moscow and there is not a single independent councilor,\" Torstrem adds, emphasizing, \"doing politics today is very difficult.\" \"Alexei Navalny is at another level, and hes in prison. Vladimir Kara-Murza is also in prison. Those who havent left are in prison. Politics arent possible, only a bit of activism,\" she laments.\n\nFor now, the councilors are undergoing an administrative procedure that may involve more fines like the one slapped on Paligua. \"I hope the court doesnt convict us, because we didnt do anything illegal. We called a legal session, and we addressed the representatives following the procedures set out by federal laws,\" Nikita Yuferev, one of the councilors, told this newspaper. After months of unsuccessfully attempting to contact the Russian president to request the end of the offensive, Dmitri Paliuga proposed using legal means: addressing the Duma. Six days later, he was facing trial for it.\n\n\"We have not asked the federal deputies to do anything illegal. We only urged them to go to the Constitution and start a process that it allows,\" Yuferev said by phone. A councilor since 2019, he said that the intention of his letter was to make Putins public aware that the offensive has led to more countries joining NATO and the rearmament of Ukraine.\n\n\"I dont think that making an appeal to comply with the law means discrediting the Armed Forces, but we live in Russia, and if they want to punish us, none of our arguments will be valid for them,\" adds Yuferev, who quotes a Russian saying: \"No one is safe from jail or poverty.\"\n\nThe letter came at the time of the clearest advance of Ukrainian forces. \"It was a coincidence. We did not expect an attack,\" says the politician. They had previously undertaken other initiatives to demand peace. On February 24, the day the offensive began in Ukraine, they made a request to call for a demonstration, which was denied by the Saint Petersburg City Council. Then, on March 2, the council held a public street meeting in which it approved sending a petition to Putin to end his military campaign. \"We did not receive a response from the presidential administration,\" said the councilman.\n\nFor now, the opposition will continue to be relegated to small gestures on the local scene. \"Unfortunately, the current high-level Russian politics, the legislative power of the regions and the State Duma, is controlled by the authorities. It does not allow anyone who can cause trouble to enter, much less talk about the mistakes of the special operation. That is why it is necessary to act from municipal politics, which are less controlled,\" Yuferev explains.",

Through tears, she recounted having to tell her 5-year-old daughter that he was never coming home and watching her infant daughter take her first steps without her father there.\n\n\"You robbed a great man of a good life,\" Stephanie Magli told 35-year-old Robert Allen Holzaepfel. \"But you also robbed my kids of the life that they deserve, and an opportunity for me to grow old with my best friend.\"\n\nHolzaepfel was sentenced to 35 years in prison Friday after he pleaded guilty to third-degree murder, DUI manslaughter and a felony charge of driving while his license was suspended or revoked. He could have been sentenced to life in prison if convicted during a trial, but Maglis family asked prosecutors to accept the plea deal that public defenders had offered.\n\nFrank Magli, the deputys father, reflected on the impact of Holzaepfels choices.\n\n\"You create loss that touches every facet of our life,\" he said, addressing the defendant, who sat quietly next to public defenders in an orange jumpsuit.\n\nMaglis mother said her faith compels her to forgive Holzaepfel, even if it takes \"a lifetime of trying.\"\n\nShe said she wasnt happy when she first heard that her son planned to go into law enforcement because she worried he could die in the line of duty. In February of last year, her fears came true.\n\n\"Its been a complete nightmare,\" Angela Magli-Ramirez said as she wept on the stand.\n\n\"I didnt know unconditional love until he was born,\" she later added.\n\nLaw enforcement officers packed the courtroom Friday in a show of support. Pinellas Sheriff Bob Gualtieri sat between Maglis parents and widow in the front row. Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney Bruce Bartlett, who prosecuted the high-profile killings of three other law enforcement officers, also was there to represent the state, alongside Assistant State Attorney Emily VanOosting.\n\nStephanie Magli asked Holzaepfel to address the family himself. But instead, he stayed silent as his public defender, Margaret Russell, spoke on his behalf.\n\n\"Your honor,\" Russell addressed Judge Joseph Bulone, \"Robert Holzaepfel has asked me to say that theres no apology, no act of atonement, no words of prayer that can bring back this loved husband, father, friend and colleague.\"\n\nWant breaking news in your inbox?

They broke the trucks window to try to get into the vehicle and help Holzaepfel, who then sped off and drove south down East Lake Road, according to Gualtieri.\n\nDeputies responded to the scene to stop Holzaepfel. Magli had gotten out of his car to deploy stop sticks when Holzaepfels truck slammed into Magli and spun out of control into the median, trapping the deputy under the vehicle. Holzaepfels blood alcohol level was almost three times the legal limit at the time of the crash, deputies said.\n\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page, Maglis death was the first line-of-duty death in the Pinellas County Sheriffs Offices 110-year history.\n\n\"For us, this is the first, thankfully, and hopefully the last ever in the history of Pinellas County Sheriffs Office,\" Gualtieri told reporters after the sentencing. \"And it is something undoubtedly that we think about every single day and will think about every single day, as we should.\"\n\nGualtieri recalled Magli as a \"good guy\" committed to doing his job every day. Just recently, the sheriff said, somebody had approached him about a family member who was driving on East Lake Road the day Hozaepfel was racing down the street.\n\n\"If Michael hadnt been there doing what he did, this drunk who didnt care about anybody or anything, who was running from the cops wouldve plowed through that median and taken out a whole bunch of cars and a whole bunch of people,\" Gualtieri said.\n\nThe 35 years Hozaepfel will serve in prison is equivalent to a life sentence, Gualtieri said.\n\n\"This is justice,\" he said. \"The system worked the way it was supposed to work.\"",

REUTERS/REUTERS PHOTOGRAPHER Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nSummary Local councillors demanded Putin be removed for 'treason'\n\nOne member fined $780 for discrediting authorities\n\nRare act of public dissent by elected deputies\n\nSept 13 (Reuters) - A group of St Petersburg local politicians who called for President Vladimir Putin to be sacked over the war in Ukraine faces the likely dissolution of their district council following a judge's ruling on Tuesday, one of the deputies said.\n\nNikita Yuferev said the judge decided that a series of past council meetings had been invalid, paving the way for it to be broken up by the regional governor.\n\nAnother council member, Dmitry Palyuga, said the same court then fined him 47,000 roubles ($780) for \"discrediting\" the authorities by calling for Putin's removal. Court officials could not be reached by telephone for comment.\n\nFour more members of the Smolninskoye local council are due to appear in court in the next two days.\n\nLast week, a group of deputies from the council appealed to the State Duma to bring charges of state treason against Putin and strip him of power, citing a series of reasons including Russia's military losses in Ukraine and the damage to its economy from Western sanctions.\n\nAnother local deputy said 65 municipal representatives from St Petersburg, Moscow and several other regions had signed a petition she published on Monday calling for Putin's resignation.\n\nWhile posing no current threat to Putin's grip on power, the moves mark rare expressions of dissent by elected representatives at a time when Russians risk heavy prison sentences for \"discrediting\" the armed forces or spreading \"deliberately false information\" about them. read more\n\nPalyuga told Reuters before Tuesday's hearing that the group's appeals were aimed not only at liberal Russians but also at \"people loyal to the authorities who are starting to have doubts when they see the lack of success of the Russian army\".\n\nHe said he expected the numbers of such people to increase after last week's lightning counter-offensive in which Ukraine drove Russian forces out of dozens of towns and recaptured a large swathe of territory in its northeast Kharkiv region. read more\n\n\"Of course, what is happening now has successfully coincided with our agenda. Many people who liked Putin are starting to feel betrayed. I think the more successfully the Ukrainian army operates, the more such people will become,\" he said.\n\n'VERY, VERY THIN' LINE\n\nRussian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said the greater risk to the Kremlin lay not in the councillors' protest itself but in the danger of responding too harshly to it.\n\n\"The reaction, or overreaction, may cause more political damage to the regime than this petition. But I have no doubts that all those who signed the petition will (come) under political pressure,\" said Stanovaya, founder of the independent analysis project R.Politik.\n\nThousands of legal cases have been launched against people accused of discrediting the army, usually leading to fines for first-time offences, but a Moscow district councillor was jailed for seven years in July after being convicted of spreading false information. Several other journalists and opposition figures have been charged and face potential prison terms.

There can be nothing criminal about it,\" she told Reuters.\n\n\"Of course there is a certain risk, but to show solidarity with our colleagues - independent politicians who still remain in Russia - is much more important.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Filipp Lebedev; Editing by Bill Berkrot\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "After Russian forces in Ukraine suffered a series of crushing defeats over the weekend, Russian President Vladimir Putin went into retreat himself.\n\nThe Russian president postponed a planned meeting with his top military brass and representatives of the defense industry in Sochi, in a sign that Putin is caught in the lurch after Ukrainian forces reclaimed a lot of territory that Russian armed forces had seized earlier in the war, according to TASS. It is thought to be the largest Russian defeat since the beginning of the war.\n\n\"The Sochi meetings are in demand, they will continue,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, indicating that the meeting was just being postponed, not canceled.\n\nPeskov said Putin had pushed off the meeting with Russian defense leadership and defense industry representatives, which is usually held in May, due to a \"very, very busy\" schedule.\n\nBut he also suggested that Putin needed time to digest the new developments in the war, alluding to the losses.\n\n\"Especially since as the special military operation develops, certain experience is gained that needs to be discussed,\" Peksov added.\n\nThis is now at least the second shakeup Russian defense leadership have had to endure in trying to set up this meeting with Putin this year. In the thick of the invasion this May, Peskov suggested there were no plans to hold the usual meeting.\n\nOther signs that the Ukrainian counteroffensive has left the Kremlin shaken have emerged in recent hours. Putin had planned to host a series of referenda as a way to fabricate support for Russias takeover. But Putin has now allegedly canceled them, according to Meduza, which cites two sources close to the Kremlin.\n\nA pro-Moscow official in Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, has also suggested the referenda are on \"pause\" given the Ukrainian counteroffensive, although he has sought to walk back his comments, according to France 24.\n\nThe news comes days after Ukrainian forces began launching a counteroffensive in southern territories captured by Russia. Ukrainian forces also launched operations aimed at the northeast of the country, which Russian troops likely werent prepared for. Russia had rerouted forces to the south to handle the expected counteroffensive there, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nThat regrouping may have been a strategic blunder. In the end, Russian forces were outnumbered by eight to one in the Kharkiv region, according to Vitaly Ganchev, a top military official appointed to the region.\n\nUkrainian forces have so far reclaimed over 3,000 square kilometers of territory since the beginning of the month, according to Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forcesa statistic that would indicate the Ukrainians have tripled their won territory in just a couple of days. Ukrainians have reclaimed more than 20 settlements in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, sending Russian forces retreating. Ukrainians have also taken Vysokopillia, Novovoznesenske, Bilohirka, Myroliubivka, and Sukhyi Stavok, Natalia Humeniuk, the head of the United Coordinating Press Center of Defense Forces of the South of Ukraine, said Monday.\n\nThe wins that Ukrainian armed forces secured in the last several days could place Russian narratives about the warwhich, in Russia, remain focused on an alleged attempt to \"liberate\" the Donbasin jeopardy.\n\nAccording to a British intelligence assessment, the losses will likely inject tension into Russias military leadership and exacerbate existing suspicions in Russias military ranks, which have been gutted in recent weeks.\n\n\"The rapid Ukrainian successes have significant implications for Russias overall operational design,\" the British intelligence assessment states. \"The majority of the force in Ukraine is highly likely being forced to prioritize emergency defensive actions.\"\n\n\"The already limited trust deployed troops have in Russias senior military leadership is likely to deteriorate further,\" the assessment read.\n\nAlready, Russian officials are second-guessing the entire \"special\" military operation in Ukraine. Municipal deputies from Moscow and St. Petersburg demanded that Putin resign, noting that \"everything went wrong.\" Some lawmakers have accused Putin of high treason for invading Ukraine.\n\nEven Ramzan Kadyrov, Putins key ally in Chechnya, has started lobbing criticism at Russias military.\n\n\"Mistakes were made,\" Kadyrov said on Telegram. \"And if today or tomorrow changes are not made to the strategy of the special military operation,' I will be forced to turn to the leadership of the Ministry of Defense, the leadership of the country to explain to them the situation that is really happening on the ground.\"\n\nSo far, though, the Kremlin has attempted to project a sense of calm about the losses in Ukraine. Russias Defense Ministry hasnt explicitly admitted a defeat, but rather has indicated Russia has made a decision to \"regroup.\"\n\n\"In order to achieve the declared goals of the special military operation for the liberation of Donbas, it was decided to regroup the Russian forces stationed near Balakleya and Izyum to boost efforts in the Donetsk direction,\" Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Igor Konashenkov told reporters.\n\nPeskov, for his part, said that Russia will continue to work to achieve its military goals.\n\n\"The special military operation is underway and will continue until the goals that have been set are achieved,\" Peskov told reporters.",

But there is a solution across Cal State campuses offering education as a gateway to avoid re-incarceration. In 2016, the RAND Corporation found that individuals who participate in educational programs while in prison are 43% less likely to return to prison. Project Rebound was created in that spirit. The program began at San Francisco State University by a former prison inmate who became a college professor, John Irwin. The program has expanded to over 14 Cal State campuses, including Sacramento State. Insight spoke with Aaron Greene, who is a former student turned director of Project Rebound at Sac State, as well as current student Desiree McFarland about how the program is working to help those formerly incarcerated achieve their higher education goals and avoid re-offending.\n\n\"Claire and the Eager Speaker\"\n\nFrom \"Alexa\" to \"Siri\" and \"Google Assistant,\" smart speakers have made their way into our daily lives. But technology meant to add efficiency and convenience can come with some kinks that can make us feel like we're speaking different languages, especially when you throw in the curveball of imaginative and crafty children. NPR White House Correspondent Tamara Keith knows this all too well. Her son Davis found a way to outsmart not only the speaker but parents. And these escapades were the perfect inspiration for a children's book. Tamara and her sons are the authors of \"Claire and the Eager Speaker,\" a read-along picture book with anecdotes many families can relate to.",

                "cc_text": "ST. PETERSBURG Deputy Mayor Stephanie Owens resigned Friday following allegations from the citys former communications director that she fostered a \"hostile work environment.\"\n\nOwens tendered her resignation about two hours after Mayor Ken Welch announced to staff that he had placed her on administrative leave pending an investigation into Janelle Irwin Taylors claims. Owens last day at the city is Sept. 9.\n\n\"Recent events distract from our impactful and intentional work to move our great city forward, and therefore I resign in the spirit of progress,\" Owens wrote in an email to Welch. \"I have been privileged to serve alongside committed colleagues on behalf of our city, who I know will continue to pursue the mission of equity and innovation. I look forward to continuing to be a change agent to implement that mission.\"\n\nThe first scandal of the Welch administration began eight months into his tenure on Thursday, when Taylor, the citys former communications director, abruptly resigned. She cited Owens as the reason why, saying she created a \"hostile work environment\" and \"culture of bullying\" while providing little communication or guidance.\n\nTaylors accusations are similar to those made in a letter signed by some of Welchs former campaign staff. Prior to being appointed by Welch to serve as deputy mayor and chief of policy, Owens was Welchs campaign manager and transition director.\n\nThe letter, with signatures removed out of fear of retaliation, was provided to the Tampa Bay Times by a former campaign staffer who was one of the people who signed it. A high-ranking campaign worker who read it at that time confirmed its authenticity. The letter begins with praise for Welchs campaign and his 15-point victory in the August 2021 primary election.\n\n\"Since the majority of the team was formed in May of 2021, the campaigns central leadership has been vested in our campaign manager, Stephanie Owens,\" the letter reads. \"Over the course of the past four months under her leadership, the campaign internally has devolved into a toxic work environment that has taken form in instances of aggression, rudeness, deception, deep unprofessionalism and a general negativity to people both inside and outside of the campaign.\"\n\nIt continues: \"Each of us have stories and experiences that have compelled us to pen this letter.\"\n\nOwens initially referred comments about Taylors claims to a city spokesperson. Reached by the Times on Friday, Owens denied the allegations.\n\n\"Theres no truth to what she said,\" Owens said. \"But whats more important is to keep any distractions at a minimum to allow the Welch administration to continue to drive and be successful.\"\n\nAsked about the campaign letter detailing similar allegations to Taylor, Owens said, \"I do not have comment about that letter.\"\n\nWelch notified staff of placing Owens on administrative leave in an email Friday morning. He did not respond to requests by phone, text and email for comment about the campaign letter or Owens resignation. A news conference is planned for next week.\n\nSpend your days with Hayes Subscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletter Columnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday.

We will continue to move forward.\"\n\nFollowing Owens resignation, interim city spokesperson Yolanda Fernandez said there is no longer a need for an internal review. Owens made an annual salary of $217,000.\n\nShe said the mayor has asked human resources staff to develop additional initiatives to educate employees on their rights and protections meant to foster workplace civility and professionalism.\n\nTaylor said she appreciates how Welch has responded to her concerns.\n\n\"I am grateful to Mayor Welch for taking this situation seriously and ensuring adequate investigation,\" Taylor said. \"I am hopeful these events will begin a period of healing and growth.\"\n\nAsked if she would take her job back if offered, Taylor said, \"I would evaluate that decision if the option became available.\"",

                "cc_text": "More than 40 local elected officials across Russia signed a two-sentence petition on Monday that ended with: \"We demand the resignation of Vladimir Putin from the post of president of the Russian Federation!\"\n\nThe petition, pushed by opponents of the Ukraine invasion, had no practical impact, and it was roundly ignored in Russias state-controlled media. But it was striking in its very existence, showing that despite the Kremlins extraordinary crackdown on dissent, Ukraines counteroffensive successes have left opponents of President Vladimir V. Putin newly emboldened and his supporters looking for someone else to blame.\n\nPro-war commentators and politicians have pointed to the military leadership or senior officials, saying they have not waged the war with sufficient decisiveness and competence, or have not delivered all the facts to Mr. Putin. Longtime Kremlin critics have seized on that discord, and Russias setbacks at the front, to take the risk of speaking out against Mr. Putin.\n\n\"There is now hope that Ukraine will end this war,\" said Ksenia Torstrem, a member of a municipal council in St. Petersburg who helped organize the petition and called Ukrainian advances an \"inspiring factor\" for it. \"We decided we needed to put pressure on from all sides.\"\n\nOn Russian state television, where criticism of the Kremlin is rare, supporters of the war are increasingly pointing fingers over what they cast as a disorganized and insufficiently concerted invasion; others are raising the idea of suing for peace. With anger spreading over the embarrassing withdrawal of Russian troops from more than a thousand square miles of northeastern Ukraine, one senior lawmaker said in an interview that an \"urgent adjustment\" to the war effort was needed.\n\nIn a phone interview on Monday, that lawmaker, Konstantin F. Zatulin, a senior member of Parliament in Mr. Putins United Russia party, laid out the stakes.\n\nMr. Zatulin described the retreat by Russian troops as doing \"very serious damage to the very idea of this special military operation,\" using the term that the Kremlin has adopted for the war. But he also cautioned that if criticism of the war effort from across the political spectrum spirals out of control, it could lead to unforeseen consequences, citing the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Soviet collapse of 1991.\n\n\"It must be underlined that this criticism should not go overboard,\" he said. \"Otherwise, it could spark an uncontrollable reaction.\"\n\nImage A photograph released by state media showing Vladimir V. Putin leading a video meeting on economic issues from the Kremlin on Monday. Credit... Gavriil Grigorov/Sputnik, via Agence France-Presse Getty Images\n\nMr. Zatulin insisted that any optimism by people hoping that Mr. Putin would be toppled was \"very much premature.\" Ukraines successes, he said, might prompt the Kremlin to escalate its war effort to try to deliver Ukraine a decisive defeat, though he added that he did not expect this to mean \"nuclear war.\"\n\n\"What now appears to some to be the success of the Ukrainian side could in fact lead to the last drop that will lead to the beginning of a war for real,\" Mr. Zatulin said. \"Given that Russia truly did not use the full force of its abilities, nothing remains to be done other than to demonstrate this force.\"\n\nThere is no evidence that Mr. Putins hold on power might be weakening, and the Kremlin on Monday said the invasion would \"be continued until the original goals are achieved.\"\n\nStill, there were gathering signs that Russias elite was unsettled by the armys retreat and uncertain how to proceed.\n\nA member of the lower house of Parliament, Mikhail Sheremet, told a Russian news outlet that the military would not succeed in Ukraine \"without a full mobilization.\" It was an implicit criticism of Mr. Putins refusal to carry out a nationwide draft, a step that Russian proponents of an escalated war effort have long been demanding.\n\nThe leader of a pro-Putin party, Sergei Mironov, praised the strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure targets Sunday night that left parts of the country without power, but complained that they \"should have been carried out two to three months ago.\"\n\nAnd on the social network Telegram, where pro-war Russian military bloggers have gained huge followings, the grumbling also continued. \"Stop whining,\" Yevgeny Poddubny, a war correspondent for Russian state television, posted, referring to those who were worried about an escalating war.\n\nBut a senior member of the upper house, Andrei Klimov, tried to push back against the voices calling for all-out war, telling reporters that he saw no \"necessity\" for a mobilization or for martial law to be declared.\n\nImage Russian conscripts watching a tank biathlon at army games in the Moscow region last month. Credit... Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times\n\nOpponents of Mr. Putin have been heartened by the discord.\n\n\"Many have the hope that something will finally break,\" Ivan I. Kurilla, a historian at the European University at St. Petersburg and a critic of Mr. Putin, said in a phone interview. \"We are probably wrong, its probably not yet time, but since everyone has been waiting for half a year for something to crack, this hope is very strong.\"\n\nAfter the invasion in February, Mr. Putin led the most intense crackdown on dissent since taking power two decades ago, signing a censorship law that made any criticism of the war effort or even calling it a war rather than a \"special military operation\" a potential crime. Thousands of journalists, activists and others fled the country, while just about all the prominent independent news media outlets still operating inside Russia were forced to shut down. Leading opposition figures who refused to flee were jailed.\n\nSo when a group of municipal council members from Mr. Putins home city of St. Petersburg published a statement calling for the president to be removed from office for treason last week, it was a shocking move in an environment in which fear of imprisonment has driven almost all criticism of Mr. Putin underground.\n\nSome of those council members now face fines for \"discrediting\" the military and government, but in Moscow, members of another municipal council followed suit in calling for Mr. Putin to resign. And over the weekend, Ms. Torstrem, the St. Petersburg representative, wrote to fellow opposition-minded local deputies in a Telegram chat group: \"I also want to do something.\"\n\nShe was convinced to speak out, she said, both by colleagues who had already published anti-Putin statements and by the military advances of Ukrainian troops. She also noted the unhappiness in the pro-Putin camp, saying it put the Kremlin in a particularly delicate spot.\n\nImage Abandoned munitions in a village on the outskirts of Izium, on Sunday. Credit... Juan Barreto/Agence France-Presse Getty Images\n\nMs. Torstrem, who is 38, helped draft the petition issued Monday calling on Mr. Putin to step down. She was careful not to mention the war, to avoid making any of the signatories vulnerable under the laws that criminalize criticism of it. The petition said only that Mr. Putins actions \"do harm to the future of Russia and its citizens.\"\n\nThe petition had 19 signatories from Moscow and St. Petersburg when she published it on Twitter Monday morning. By the end of the day, the number had grown to more than 40, including municipal representatives from the remote city of Yakutsk in Siberia and from Samara on the Volga River.\n\nShe acknowledged that it was unclear how, in practice, the petition might help precipitate Mr. Putins resignation. But one signatory, Vasily Khoroshilov, a municipal deputy in Moscow, said the idea was to send a message to powerful opponents of Mr. Putin that they would have support among the Russian public.\n\n\"The radical patriots have also started to doubt the correctness of the path that is being followed,\" Mr. Khoroshilov, 38, said in a phone interview. \"Some forces in the highest echelons of power might take some kind of decisive action if they see support among the people.\"\n\nMr. Putins core supporters appear to be focused on the notion that any problems in the war are not his fault, but that he was being misled by senior officials or the military leadership.\n\nThat was the message sent by Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman ruler of the southern Russian region of Chechnya. He posted a rambling voice message to his Telegram account over the weekend and warned that if the military did not change its strategy \"today or tomorrow,\" he would be forced \"to speak to the Defense Ministrys leadership and the countrys leadership to explain to them the real situation on the ground.\"\n\nImage Ramzan Kadyrov, center, at a military parade in the Chechen capital in May. Credit... Chingis Kondarov/Reuters\n\nMr. Zatulin, the senior lawmaker, said that many in Russia believed that \"Putin was wrongly informed and doesnt know everything, that he was deluded.\"\n\n\"The president himself maintains his authority and is the foundation of stability at this moment,\" Mr. Zatulin said.\n\nBut, he cautioned, \"its clear that any system has its limits.\"\n\nAlina Lobzina and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.",

All times EDT.\n\n9:12 p.m.: Ukraine has set its sights on freeing all of the territory occupied by invading Russian forces, a goal U.S. President Joe Biden said would be \"a long haul\" to achieve.\n\nIn a Tuesday evening address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said around 8,000 square kilometers have been liberated by Ukrainian forces so far this month, apparently all in the northeastern region of Kharkiv.\n\n\"Stabilization measures\" had been completed in about half of that territory, Zelenskyy said, \"and across a liberated area of about the same size, stabilization measures are still ongoing.\"\n\nReuters was not able to immediately verify the full scope of battlefield successes claimed by Ukraine.\n\nAsked whether Ukraine has reached a turning point in the six-month war, Biden said it was hard to tell.\n\n\"It's clear the Ukrainians have made significant progress. But I think its going to be a long haul,\" he said.\n\n8 p.m.: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to withdraw his troops from Ukraine, as a counter-offensive by Kyiv's forces made quick advances.\n\nScholz urged Putin in a 90-minute telephone call to \"come to a diplomatic solution as quickly as possible, based on a cease-fire, a complete withdrawal of Russian forces and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Ukraine,\" according to the chancellor's spokesman Steffen Hebestreit, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nIn a phone call, Scholz also urged Putin \"not to discredit and continue to fully implement\" the grain deal in light of the stretched global food supply, Hebestreit said.\n\n7:04 p.m.:\n\n5:51 p.m.: In Balakliya, a crucial military supply hub taken by Ukrainian forces late last week, Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said 150,000 people had been liberated from Russian rule in the area, Reuters reported.\n\nMaria Tymofeeva, 43, said fighting had raged for three days last week before going quiet.\n\n\"A lot of people have disappeared,\" she said. Asked if there were many collaborators in the town, she said, \"I think so, yes,\" before adding, with a laugh, \"I think they have fled!\"\n\nFighting was continuing elsewhere in the northeastern Kharkiv region, Maliar earlier told Reuters, saying Ukraine's forces were making good progress because they were highly motivated and their operation well planned.\n\n4:29 p.m.: The Biden administration is likely to announce a fresh military aid package for Ukraine in \"coming days,\" the White House said on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n\n\"I do think you'll see another one here in coming days,\" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters.\n\n3:25 p.m.: The United Nations is trying to broker a resumption of Russian ammonia exports through Ukraine, a Western diplomat said on Tuesday, a move that could stabilize a landmark deal allowing Ukrainian food and fertilizer shipments from Black Sea ports, Reuters reported.\n\nAmmonia is a key ingredient in nitrate fertilizer. A pipeline transporting ammonia from Russia's Volga region to Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa was shut down when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nFacilitating Russia's food and fertilizer exports is a central aspect of a package deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey on July 22 that also restarted Ukraine's Black Sea grain and fertilizer shipments. Russia has recently criticized the deal, complaining that its exports were still hindered.\n\nThe United Nations has proposed that ammonia gas owned by Russian fertilizer producer Uralchem be brought via pipeline to the Russia-Ukraine border. There it would be purchased by U.S.-headquartered commodities trader Trammo, according to the proposal.\n\n2:30 p.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday posted a promotional video on Twitter encouraging people to buy Ukrainian-made goods, saying a percentage of the profits will go toward efforts to rebuild the country.\n\n2:10 p.m.: A group of St. Petersburg local politicians who called for President Vladimir Putin to be sacked over the war in Ukraine faces the likely dissolution of their district council following a judge's ruling on Tuesday, one of the deputies said, according to Reuters.\n\nNikita Yuferev said the judge decided that a series of past council meetings had been invalid, paving the way for it to be broken up by the regional governor. Another council member, Dmitry Palyuga, said the same court then fined him 47,000 rubles ($780) for \"discrediting\" the authorities by calling for Putin's removal. Court officials could not be reached by telephone for comment.\n\nFour more members of the Smolninskoye local council are due to appear in court in the next two days.\n\nLast week, a group of deputies from the council appealed to the State Duma to bring charges of state treason against Putin and strip him of power, citing a series of reasons including Russia's military losses in Ukraine and the damage to its economy from Western sanctions.\n\nAnother local deputy said 65 municipal representatives from St. Petersburg, Moscow and several other regions had signed a petition she published on Monday calling for Putin's resignation.\n\nWhile posing no current threat to Putin's grip on power, the moves mark rare expressions of dissent by elected representatives at a time when Russians risk heavy prison sentences for \"discrediting\" the armed forces or spreading \"deliberately false information\" about them.\n\n1:55 p.m.: A local councilor from St. Petersburg who called on Vladimir Putin to resign says he's been overwhelmed by the level of support from members of the public. Dmitry Palyuga, of St. Petersburg's Smolny municipal council, co-authored a petition calling on the Russian president to step down that was sent to Russia's State Duma. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report:\n\n1:20 p.m.: International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said she spoke with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday and they agreed to explore ways to ramp up the IMF's support for Ukraine using all available tools, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Excellent call with President @ZelenskyyUa,\" Georgieva wrote on Twitter. She said they discussed how the global lender could \"continue to back Ukraine and agreed to explore ways to ramp up our financial and policy engagement to (Ukraine) using all tools available to us.\"\n\nThe call came a day after the IMF's executive board held an informal session to discuss proposed changes that would give all member countries, including Ukraine, access to additional emergency funding to deal with budget woes caused by food shocks.\n\nIn a separate posting on Twitter, Zelenskyy said he spoke with Georgieva and thanked her for \"the allocation of $1.4 billion of additional support. Discussed future cooperation to increase Ukraine's financial stability.\"\n\n12:50 pm.: The Kremlin on Tuesday hailed the significance of Russian President Vladimir Putins planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week, noting that its particularly important amid tensions with the West, The Associated Press reported.\n\nPutins foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the two leaders are scheduled to meet Thursday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, on the sidelines of a summit of a security pact dominated by Moscow and Beijing.\n\n\"The meeting has a special significance in view of the current international situation,\" Ushakov told reporters, saying Putin and Xi will discuss the international situation, along with regional issues and bilateral cooperation.\n\nChina has pointedly refused to criticize Russias action in Ukraine and denounced Western sanctions against Moscow. Russia, in turn, has strongly backed China amid tensions with the U.S. that followed a recent visit to Taiwan by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\"China has taken a well-balanced approach to the Ukrainian crisis, clearly expressing its understanding of the reasons that prompted Russia to launch the special military operation,\" Ushakov said. \"The issue will be thoroughly discussed during the meeting.\"\n\nThe talks between Putin and Xi follow their meeting in February, when the Russian leader attended the opening of the Beijing Olympics shortly before sending troops into Ukraine.\n\n12:15 p.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin has yet to publicly comment on a lightning rout of his forces in north-eastern Ukraine, but is under pressure from nationalists at home to regain the initiative.\n\nHe has few quick fix options, if Western intelligence and open source analysis is accurate, and most of the potential steps he could take come with domestic and geopolitical risks.\n\nReuters has enumerated some of Putins main options in Ukraine in this report.\n\n11:40 a.m.:\n\n11:15 a.m.: Ukraines military claimed Tuesday for the first time that it encountered an Iranian-supplied suicide drone used by Russia on the battlefield, The Associated Press reported, showing the deepening ties between Moscow and Tehran as the Islamic Republics tattered nuclear deal with world powers hangs in the balance.\n\nU.S. intelligence publicly warned back in July that Tehran planned to send hundreds of the bomb-carrying drones to Russia to aid its war on Ukraine. While Iran initially denied it, the head of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has boasted in recent days about arming the worlds top powers.\n\nThe Ukrainian militarys Strategic Communications Directorate published images of the wreckage of the drone. It resembled a triangle, or delta-shaped, drone flown by Iran known as the Shahed, or \"Witness\" in Farsi.\n\nThe military official and the website both said Ukrainian troops encountered the drone near Kupiansk amid Kyivs offensive that has punched through Russian lines around Kharkiv on the eastern front.\n\nThe image suggested the Shahed drone had been shot down by Ukrainian forces and hadnt detonated on impact as designed, though little other information was immediately released by Kyiv. An inscription on the drone identified it as an \"M214 Gran-2,\" which didnt immediately correspond to known Russian weaponry.\n\n11:05 a.m.: Chancellor Olaf Scholz invoked the spirit of the Berlin Airlift on Tuesday to implore Germans that \"the seemingly impossible can succeed,\" urging them to brace for a tough winter and to rise to the challenge of a shift in energy supply away from Russian gas, Reuters reported.\n\nHe spoke to business leaders at Tempelhof Airport, which was the focal point of the Airlift between 1948 and 1949, when Western forces flew hundreds of thousands of tonnes of supplies into divided Berlin after the Soviets blocked rail and street access to the city's Western-occupied sectors.\n\nGermany and other European countries are scrambling to secure energy supplies after Russia halted flows through a key gas pipeline. Moscow blames sanctions, imposed by the West after Russia invaded Ukraine, for impeding the pipeline's maintenance.\n\n\"Of course we knew and we know that our solidarity with Ukraine will have consequences,\" Scholz said in a speech at the German Employers' Day.\n\n10:45 a.m.: Pope Francis begged for an end to Russias \"senseless and tragic war\" in Ukraine as he arrived Tuesday in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan to join faith leaders from around the world in praying for peace, The Associated Press reported.\n\nFrancis flew to the Kazakh capital of Nur-Sultan to meet with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev for an official state visit portion of his three-day trip. On Wednesday and Thursday, he participates in a government-sponsored triennial interfaith meeting, which is gathering more than 100 delegations of Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Shinto and other faith groups from 50 countries.\n\n\"I have come to echo the plea of all those who cry out for peace, which is the essential path to development for our globalized world,\" he said.\n\nDirecting himself at global superpowers, he said expanding efforts at diplomacy and dialogue were ever more important. \"And those who hold greater power in the world have greater responsibility with regard to others, especially those countries most prone to unrest and conflict.\"\n\n\"Now is the time to stop intensifying rivalries and reinforcing opposing blocs,\" he said.\n\n10:30 a.m.:\n\n10:15 a.m.: Ukraine on Tuesday vowed to liberate all its territory after driving back Russian forces in the northeast of country and raising flags over battle-scarred towns, calling on the West to speed up deliveries of weapons to back the dramatic advance, Reuters reported.\n\nSince Moscow abandoned its main bastion in northeastern Ukraine on Saturday, marking its worst defeat since the early days of the war, Ukrainian troops have recaptured dozens of towns in a stunning shift in battleground momentum.\n\nSpeaking in Balakliia, a crucial military supply hub taken by Ukrainian forces, Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar said 150,000 people had been liberated from Russian rule in the area. She spoke in the central square, where Ukrainian flags had been raised.\n\n\"The aim is to liberate the Kharkiv region and beyond - all the territories occupied by the Russian Federation,\" she said on the road to Balakliia, which lies 74 km (46 miles) southeast of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city.\n\n10:00 a.m.: Russian occupiers have begun leaving the southern Ukrainian region of Crimea with their families, the Kyiv Independent reported on Twitter Tuesday, citing a report by Ukrainian intelligence.\n\n\"An \"urgent evacuation\" of Russian proxies, intelligence officers, and military commanders is taking place, the Main Intelligence Directorate said,\" according to the media outlet.\n\n\"The developments are a direct result of successful Ukrainian counteroffensives,\" it quoted the intelligence report as saying.\n\nThe report could not immediately be independently verified.\n\n9:45 a.m.:\n\n9:20 a.m.: Any damage inflicted on Ukraine's power and heating systems will seriously exacerbate living conditions this winter, especially for an estimated 6.9 million internally displaced people, the United Nations' migration agency said on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n\nIn response to a Ukrainian counter-offensive in the east and south of the country in recent days, Russia has stepped up shelling of power stations and other infrastructure, causing blackouts in the city of Kharkiv and elsewhere.\n\n\"Any attempt to damage those facilities will have a terrible impact on the capacity to heat those cities,\" Antonio Vitorino, director general of the International Organization of Migration (IOM) told a group of reporters in Kyiv.\n\n\"We are making all efforts to assist the population in preparing for the winter but we need electricity, and that depends on state services to (restore) a working electricity system,\" said Vitorino, who met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday.\n\n9:00 a.m.: Lights on monuments in the French capital will be switched off earlier than normal, to save power. In August, President Emmanuel Macron warned that high energy prices caused by the war in Ukraine could signal \"the end of abundance,\" widely interpreted as preparing public opinion for a difficult winter ahead, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n8:40 a.m.: Ukrainian authorities have detained an unspecified number of Russian teachers who moved to Ukrainian towns and cities after Russia took control of them after launching its invasion in late February, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on September 12 that the teachers, who moved to Ukraine to teach a Russian curriculum at local Ukrainian schools \"committed a crime.\"\n\n\"Of course, a court will decide on their punishment, but on the territory of our country there is still a big number of Russian citizens who came to temporarily occupied territories and they will surely face justice unless they leave our territory immediately,\" Vereshchuk said.\n\nVereshchuk added that the detained Russian teachers will not be included in prisoner-exchange lists as they are not combatants.\n\n8:25 a.m.: Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Germany on Tuesday of ignoring Kyiv's pleas for Leopard tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles, saying Berlin offered only \"abstract fears and excuses\" for not providing such military hardware, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now to liberate people and save them from genocide,\" Kuleba tweeted, as Ukraine presses a counter-offensive to retake land in the east and south from Russian forces.\n\n\"Not a single rational argument on why these weapons cannot be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?\" he wrote, in unusually blunt language.\n\n8:15 a.m.:\n\n7:50 a.m.: The Kremlin said on Tuesday there was no discussion of a nationwide mobilization to bolster the countrys military campaign in Ukraine, days after a surprise Ukrainian offensive drove Russia out of almost all of Kharkiv region, Reuters reported.\n\nAsked about a call for mobilization by a member of the Russian parliament, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: \"At the moment no, there is no discussion of this.\"\n\nAsked about criticism of the countrys leadership online by nationalist commentators who have demanded mobilization, Peskov said it was an example of \"pluralism\" and that Russians as a whole continue to support President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Russians support the president, and this is confirmed by the mood of the people ... The people are consolidated around the decisions of the head of state,\" he said.\n\n\"As for other points of view, critical points of view, as long as they remain within the law, this is pluralism, but the line is very, very thin, one must be very careful here,\" he added.\n\nMilitary commentators ordinarily supportive of the campaign reacted with fury after Russias Defense Ministry on Saturday said it was abandoning Ukraines northeastern Kharkiv region in a \"regrouping\" after the lightning counteroffensive last week. Many suggested that only a full-scale nationwide mobilization could rectify the situation.\n\n7:35 a.m.: Swedens government said on Tuesday it would donate 500,000 COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer and BioNTech to Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\n7:10 a.m.: U.S. leaders from President Joe Biden on down are being careful not to declare a premature victory after a Ukrainian offensive forced Russian troops into a messy retreat in the north, The Associated Press reported.\n\nInstead, military officials are looking toward the fights yet to come and laying out plans to provide Ukraine more weapons and expand training, while warily awaiting Russias response to the sudden, stunning battlefield losses.\n\nAlthough there was widespread celebration of Ukraines gains over the weekend, U.S. officials know Russian President Vladimir Putin still has troops and resources to tap, and his forces still control large swaths of the east and south.\n\n\"I agree there should be no spiking of the ball because Russia still has cards it can play,\" said Philip Breedlove, a retired U.S. Air Force general who was NATOs top commander from 2013 to 2016. \"Ukraine is now clearly making durable changes in its east and north and I believe that if the West properly equips Ukraine, theyll be able to hold on to their gains.\"\n\nU.S. officials acknowledged that the U.S. provided information to help the Ukrainian counteroffensive but declined to say how much or if Western officials helped strategize the idea to throw Russian forces off guard by calling attention to attack plans in the south, while actually plotting a more formidable campaign in the east.\n\nThe U.S provided information \"on conditions\" in the country, said one of the officials, but \"in the end, this was the Ukrainian choice. The Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian political leadership made the decisions on how to conduct this counteroffensive.\"\n\n6:55 a.m.:\n\n6:40 a.m.: The Russia-installed rector at Kherson State University in southeastern Ukraine, Tatyana Tomilina, has reportedly survived an assassination attempt and is currently in the hospital, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported Tuesday.\n\nRussian news agencies reported late on September 12 that a handmade explosive device detonated, killing a man thought to be her security guard and injuring Tomilina as they were entering her apartment block.\n\nInitial reports said that Tomilina was hospitalized with shrapnel wounds and contusions. Russia-appointed authorities in Kherson said on September 13 that Tomilina's life is not under threat and that her wounds are not serious.\n\nIt was not immediately possible to verify the reports. Since Russia launched its attack on Ukraine, there have been several assassination attempts conducted against Russian-appointed officials in territories occupied by Russian troops.\n\nTomilina started collaborating with Russian-imposed authorities in Kherson after Russian armed forces took control of the city in March, weeks after the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine. She later was appointed to the post of rector at the university. She was previously the director of the Mishukov Academic Lyceum at Kherson State University, a position she was fired from some time ago for her pro-Russian positions.\n\n6:25 a.m.: Fighting is still raging in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region but Ukraine's forces are making good progress because its forces are highly motivated and its operation is well planned, Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\n\"The aim is to liberate the Kharkiv region and beyond - all the territories occupied by the Russian Federation. Fighting is continuing (in Kharkiv region). It is still early to say full (Ukrainian) control has been established over Kharkiv region,\" Malyar said in an interview.\n\n\"Our strength stems from the fact that we are very motivated and that we plan operations thoroughly,\" she said, adding that Ukraine had taken the decision to press on with its operation in the Kharkiv region due to the successes notched up so far.\n\nMalyar was speaking on the road to Balakliia, a crucial military supply hub recaptured by Ukrainian forces late last week during a counter-offensive that forced Russian troops to flee further east. Balakliia is 74 km (46 miles) southeast of Kharkiv, the regional capital and Ukraine's second largest city.\n\n6:10 a.m.:\n\n5:55 a.m.: Ukrainian intelligence reports that Russia is preparing new shelling of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, according a Telegram report on The Kyiv Independent.\n\n4:45 a.m.: The Associated Press reports that, early Tuesday, Russia shelled the Ukrainian city of Lozova in the Kharkiv region, killing three people and injuring nine, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov.\n\n4 a.m.: The Kyiv Independent reports that the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine posted Tuesday morning a video showing Ukrainian troops removing Russian flags and signs from buildings in the city of Vovchansk, which was occupied on the first day of the full-scale invasion. The report says the city is \"understood to have been vacated by Russian troops on Sept. 11.\"\n\n3:24 a.m. Ukrainian troops continue to pressure retreating Russian forces, according to The Associated Press.\n\nYellow-and-blue Ukrainian flags flutter from buildings in the partly destroyed towns around the city of Kharkiv, while Ukrainian soldiers inspect charred Russian tanks left along the way, according to the news service.\n\n3 a.m.: Russia has opened a treason case against an aviation factory manager on suspicion of passing secret military information to Ukraine, according to Reuters, which referenced Russian news agencies that cited Russia's principal security agency known as FSB.\n\nAccording to Reuters, reports say the FSB said the manager is suspected of taking photos of equipment from Russia's fighter planes and sending them to a Ukrainian who worked at a Ukrainian aviation plant.\n\n2:30 a.m.\n\n1 a.m.: Sony Group Corps music business has exited Russia, transferring the business and musicians to local management, due to the Ukraine conflict, Reuters reported.\n\n\"As the war continues to have a devastating humanitarian impact in Ukraine, and sanctions on Russia continue to increase, we can no longer maintain a presence in Russia,\" Sony Music said in a statement.\n\nIt did not disclose further details of the transaction.\n\nThe music business suspended operations in Russia earlier this year following that country's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n12:30 a.m.: Ukraines grain maize (corn) harvest is expected to fall 24% below last year and 5% below the five-year average to 32.0 million tons, Reuters reported citing the European Unions crop monitoring unit.\n\n12:05 a.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there has been \"significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the Northeast,\" citing both support from the United States and other allies and \"the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian people.\"\n\n\"This is early days still,\" Blinken said. \"So, I think it would be wrong to predict exactly where this will go, when it will get there and how it will get there.\"\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "The rapid advance of Ukrainian forces in the east of the country has opened the first fissures in Russias official political discourse, which until now has closely followed the Kremlins official line. Some state commentators have openly called for the execution of the commanders who defended the now-lost territory, while other political figures have lambasted the experts who allegedly convinced Russian President Vladimir Putin to launch the \"special operation\" in Ukraine. Ukraines counteroffensive in the east also comes as Russian opposition leaders step up their attacks against Putin: some 30 councilors from the countrys two largest cities have addressed Parliament to propose the leader be dismissed on charges of high treason.\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive, which quickly gaining ground over the weekend, took Russia by surprise. On Saturday, as Kyiv announced it had retaken key posts such as Kharkiv, Putin was inaugurating Europes biggest Ferris wheel in Moscow, where the capitals residents danced and drank to celebrate the citys 875th anniversary. As Ukraine continued to announce further gains in the east, the Russian Ministry of Defense remained silent before finally announcing an \"orderly withdrawal\" in the Kharkiv region. Russia has lost other significant cities, such as Izium, as well as a key railway thoroughfare for the armys supplies.\n\nIn Russia, several sectors have begun to dispute the official justification for the withdrawal, with criticism building against the lower ranks of Putins government. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic, has been one of the most vocal critics. In a message sent on his Telegram channel, he argued that \"[the Russian army] has left and given away several cities.\" He added: \"I am not a strategist like those in the Ministry of Defense, but mistakes were made.\" Kadyrov warned that immediate changes were not made to the \"special military operation,\" he would attempt to speak directly not only with the ministry, but with Putin himself.\n\nRussias armed forces are under enormous pressure. So far, Putin has held back from declaring the general mobilization of the population, despite calls from the ultra-right. The Russian people value the armed forces even more than the Kremlin, according to polls, but the idea of mass mobilization is very unpopular.\n\nMeanwhile, journalists close to Putin have been placing the blame on Russias army commanders. One of the heads of Kremlin propaganda, Russa-1 TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov, stated on Telegram: \"Many leaders in uniform I would not dare to call them commanders are worthy of dishonorable dismissal, a criminal trial or even execution, and I could name a few.\"\n\nThe success of Ukraines counterattack has put the Kremlin advisers and army commanders in the spotlight. In a debate on the popular NTV channel, which Putin took over as soon as he entered office, several analysts and politicians questioned the recent development of Russias operations.\n\n\"[The] people who convinced President Putin that the special operation will be fast and effective, we wont strike the civilian population, well come in, and our National Guard, along with Kadyrovites [a Chechen separatist militia formed under the former head of the Chechen Republic, Akhmad Kadyrov], will bring things to order. These people really set all of us up,\" said Boris Nadezhdin, former State Duma deputy. \"Are you sure these people exist?\" the host asked. \"Of course. The president didnt just sit there and think, Why dont I start a special operation? Someone told him that the Ukrainians will surrender, that they will flee, that theyll want to join Russia,\" the analyst replied.\n\nThe frankness of the debate surprised Russia. The deputy and leader of the political faction A Just Russia, Sergey Mironov, maintained the line that there can be no negotiations with \"the Nazi regime of Zelenskiy,\" but the other guests immediately criticized him. The political expert Victor Olevich argued that \"it is said that everything is going according to plan, but no one would have thought six months ago that the plan would be to withdraw now.\" Another well-known commentator, Alexei Timofeyev, recalled that Russias state media had ironically warned that if Russian troops reached Odessa \"they would risk receiving very big hugs from the population.\" \"These errors have been criminal, catastrophic. Why should we continue to listen to the opinion of these experts?\" he demanded.\n\nOne of the best-known faces of Russian propaganda has also come under fire. Before the war, Margarita Simonian, the director of the state media organization Russia Today, said on TV that Russia \"would defeat Ukraine in two days.\" Tuesday marked the 202nd day since the start of the offensive, and Russian troops are withdrawing on several fronts.\n\nCalls for Putin to be impeached\n\nSeveral opposition politicians have been arrested for opposing the war, but criticism of Putin continues. With the national parliament strictly controlled, Russian politics largely take place in the district councils of the countrys big cities. Last week, a group of councilors from St. Petersburg caused an uproar by officially asking the Duma to be impeached for high treason. By Monday, the group had at least 30 signatures from 18 districts from Moscow and Kolpino.\n\n\"It is an intelligent and careful text. I hope that we will not be prosecuted for any reason because we have not done anything illegal. We complied with federal laws for this procedure and we presented arguments to verify, according to the Constitution, whether an impeachment procedure can be applied to him,\" explained Nikita Yuferev, one of the initiatives promoters, by telephone.\n\n\"We want to address Putins supporters so that they will think. If they believed that the expansion of NATO was a threat to Russia, now with their decision of 24-F [February 24, the day the offensive began] it turns out that the Atlantic Alliance has grown, and with the addition of Finland, its border has doubled,\" he added. \"We consider that the initiative adopted by Putin has increased the risk for the Russian Federation and its population. Now Ukraine is a danger, because as a result of 24-F it has received weapons valued at $38 billion.\"\n\n\"Our arguments are that Putin was wrong,\" said Yuferev. \"And the situation of our soldiers, the economic crisis and the problems of the young generation cannot be ignored. The Russian economy is seriously suffering,\" he added.\n\nThe idea was proposed by another comrade from his district of St. Petersburg, Dmitri Paliuga. Yuferev had addressed the Presidential Administration on March 2 to request the end of the offensive, but received no response. \"Later, in August, I wrote to the president with a personal letter asking him to end the special operation on humanitarian grounds,\" Yuferev explained. \"There was already UN data confirming that there were six million Ukrainian refugees and more than 5,000 dead, including more than 300 children,\" recalled the politician. \"They told me they would read the letter.\"\n\nPaliuga will be tried on Tuesday \"for discrediting the president of the Russian Federation.\" \"It seems that the plan is clear: make a decision with me and then punish the rest of the councilors,\" he said on his Twitter account, where he reported that the police had called him. \"They asked me if I regret having made this decision about [Putins] betrayal. Im glad I took it! I am proud of every council member! I have received a lot of messages from strangers. There are many of us!\" he added.",

The dangerous heat has heightened the fire danger across the region and pushed the states electrical grid to the limit. But there have been other impacts to this heatwave that are not as obvious and cannot be measured by a thermometer.

And despite a 3-0 loss to Orlando, the Sacramento Republic or Sac FC soccer team made all of Sacramento \"proud\" after making it all the way to the finals of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. It was a big deal for the team, a deal for Sacramento, and a big deal in moving the needle forward to maybe landing a professional soccer team here one day. To discuss the significance of the soccer club's achievement, Insight invited freelance journalist Kevin Nguyen onto the program to put the game and its significance into context.\n\nSept. 11 reflection\n\nThis Sunday marks 22 years since September 11th became seared into our countrys history.

But the death toll has grown in the years(and decades since for survivors and first responders continuing to suffer the health impacts of being exposed to Ground Zero, and the scars also include controversial wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment still felt today. Insight invited Mindi Russel, a trauma wellness chaplain with 30 years of experience who was at Ground Zero on September 11th, to reflect upon that day.",

The city was the last in the Luhansk region to fall under Russian control in July after intense fighting (8, 9, 10). Being situated on the border of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the city provides a stronghold for Russian defenses against Ukrainian advances (8, 9, 10). The city of Lysychansk was also targeted by Ukraine in a new offensive, signaling its strategic importance to the Ukrainian forces (8, 9, 10).\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian forces' rapid advance led to a shift in the situation. There were reports of the occupiers, including both the military and collaborators, fleeing in haste from Lysychansk (8, 9, 10). This retreat indicates the city's strategic significance to the Russian forces and the potential setback their withdrawal could mean. The city's recapture by Ukrainian forces would be a significant gain, shifting the balance in the conflict and likely impacting the ability of Russian forces to maintain their hold on the region (8, 9, 10)."

Following this, Ukrainian partisans were able to retake the town, boosting morale and showcasing the Ukrainian forces' capability to alter the situation on the ground via force (5, 6). \n\nLuhansk governor, Serhiy Haidai, believes this event will trigger a large-scale de-occupation of the Luhansk Oblast, beginning from Kreminna and Svatove (3). The towns' strategic location is key to the Ukrainian forces' main strikes, especially now that the Russians have begun to concentrate their equipment in these cities (3). Furthermore, Haidai confirmed that the Russian troops have left Kreminna, giving local partisans the opportunity to hoist the Ukrainian flag over the city (3). This is seen as a significant indication of Russian forces' continuing retreat in the region (2)."

As a result, the Ukrainian forces are now in a position to launch further offensives against Russian-held territories, which could lead to more significant territorial gains if Kyiv receives more powerful weapons (3,9).

The Ukrainian counteroffensive along the Oskil River has left Russian forces weakened and without reinforcements, leaving behind heavy weaponry in their retreat (4). This swift advance by Ukrainian forces, the most significant since March, has unraveled the gains Russia had made, significantly impacting Russia's overall operational design and bringing Ukrainian forces within 50 km of the Russian border (5).",

The rapid Ukrainian successes, significant gains in Kherson Oblast, and the steady degradation of the morale and combat capabilities of Russian forces suggest Ukraine's goal of re-establishing the country's 2014 borders may be achievable (1,5,8). In addition, the recent battlefield successes have prompted even pro-Kremlin voices in Russia to question the war, further impacting the morale of the Russian forces and their allied militia (7)."

This is seen as Russia's retaliation against Ukraine's military successes (4). Despite these attacks, Ukrainian forces have continued to make progress, capturing more than 6,000 sq km from the Russians in the east and south regions (7). The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, noted that his troops had retaken more than 1,000 square kilometers of territory since the start of the month, with Ukrainian forces advancing about 31 miles in the Kharkiv region (10).

The head of the regional military administration for Luhansk, Serhiy Hayday, posted a message indicating that the city of Lysychansk was the target of the new offensive. The city was lost to Russian forces and their allied militia after weeks of fierce fighting in June. Hayday later told Ukrainian media outlets Suspilne and Channel 5 that Ukrainian units had reached the outskirts of the city of Lysychansk. CNN is unable to confirm his claim. Lysychansk was the last city of any consequence to have been captured by the Russians, but they subsequently failed to make further advances into the neighboring Donetsk region. The reported Ukrainian advance toward Lysychansk comes as Ukrainian ground forces complete a sweep through much of what was Russian-held territory in Kharkiv region, depriving the Russians of a critical front in their attack on Donetsk region. In another sign of Ukrainian advances, the head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, admitted that the situation in northern Donetsk had become \"pretty tough.\" Hayday said that locals in the city of Lysychansk have reported the hasty departure of Russian officials from the city. Speaking to CNN by phone, Hayday said that according to residents, \"the occupiers, including both the collaborators and the military, are running away in a hurry.\" \"Locals have videos and photos proving that,\" Hayday said. He said the visual evidence could not be shared for security reasons. Hayday also suggested that there was an exodus of pro-Russian officials and collaborators in Luhansk toward Russia. \"Those from Svatove, Starobilsk, Novopskov are trying to leave, not to Luhansk, but to the border with Russia at Milove.\" CNN is unable to verify Hayday's claim, but at least one border crossing into Russia has seen lines of vehicles forming. Hayday also told CNN that the Russians had failed to build a defensive line in Luhansk. \"Svatove, Starobilsk this is an open rural countryside, so there's nowhere to hide.\" He claimed Russian forces were leaving the town of Svatove. If true, it would be significant as Svatove is a key link in Russian supply lines to parts of occupied Luhansk region.

Ukrainian forces have begun to advance not only to the south and east in the Kharkiv region but also to the north, Zaluzhnyi said, adding \"there are 50 kilometers to go to the state border.\" CNN cannot independently verify Zaluzhnyi's claims. Some background: After months of what was described by some analysts as a war of attrition, a fast-moving Ukrainian offensive beginning in the eastern Kharkiv region in recent days has forced Russian troops to retreat. Ukrainian forces entered the strategic city of Izium, which sits near the border between the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, on Saturday. Izium, which had been under Russian occupation for more than five months, was being used as a launching pad and rail hub for attacks southward into the Donetsk region and Kupyansk. Saturday's rapid advance did not end with Izium, as Ukraine appeared to have opened a new front against Russian defenses on the border of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The head of the regional military administration for Luhansk, Serhiy Hayday, indicated the city of Lysychansk was the target of the new offensive. Lysychanskwas the last city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine to fall under Russian control in July, after weeks of intense fighting.

Ukrainian troops piled pressure on retreating Russian forces Tuesday, pressing deeper into occupied territory and sending more Kremlin troops fleeing ahead of the counteroffensive that has inflicted a stunning blow on Moscow's military prestige.(Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP)\n\nIZIUM Hand on heart, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy watched his countrys flag rise Wednesday above the recaptured city of Izium, making a rare foray outside the capital that highlights Moscows embarrassing retreat from a Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nRussian forces left the war-scarred city last week as Kyiv's soldiers pressed a stunning advance that has reclaimed large swaths of territory in Ukraines northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nAs Zelenskyy looked on and sang the national anthem, the Ukrainian flag was raised in front of the burned-out city hall. After almost six months under Russian occupation, Izium was left largely devastated, with apartment buildings blackened by fire and pockmarked by artillery strikes.\n\nA gaping hole and piles of rubble stood where one building had collapsed.\n\n\"The view is very shocking, but it is not shocking for me,\" Zelenskyy told journalists, \"because we began to see the same pictures from Bucha, from the first de-occupied territories the same destroyed buildings, killed people.\"\n\nBucha is a small city on Kyiv's outskirts from which Russian troops withdrew in March. In the aftermath, Ukrainian authorities discovered the bodies of hundreds of civilians dumped in streets, yards and mass graves. Many bore signs of torture.\n\nProsecutors said they so far have found six bodies with traces of torture in recently retaken Kharkiv region villages. The head of the Kharkiv prosecutors office, Oleksandr Filchakov, said bodies were found in Hrakove and Zaliznyche, villages around 60 kilometers (35 miles) southeast of Kharkiv city.\n\n\"We have a terrible picture of what the occupiers did. ... Such cities as Balakliia, Izium, are standing in the same row as Bucha, Borodyanka, Irpin,\" said Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin, listing places where the Ukrainians have alleged Russian forces committed atrocities.\n\nLocal authorities have made similar claims in other areas Russia previously held, but it was not immediately possible to verify their information. They have not yet provided evidence of potential atrocities on the scale described in Bucha, where the number and conditions of civilian casualties prompted international demands to press war crimes charges against Russian officials.\n\nAs he was returning from the front early Thursday, a passenger car collided with Zelenskyy's vehicle in a motorcade in Kyiv, but he wasn't seriously hurt, his spokesman said on Facebook. Spokesman Sergii Nikiforov said the driver of the other vehicle received first aid from Zelenskyys medical team and was taken by ambulance. Medics examined the president, who suffered no serious injuries in the accident, Nikiforov wrote. He did not specify what injuries Zelenskyy, 44, might have suffered.\n\nMoscows recent rout in northeastern Ukraine was its largest military defeat since Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv area months ago. On the northern outskirts of Izium, the remains of Russian tanks and vehicles lay shattered along a road.\n\nAs Zelenskyy visited, his forces pressed their counteroffensive, de-mined retaken ground and investigated possible war crimes. He said that \"life comes back\" as Ukrainian soldiers return to previously occupied villages.\n\nThe Ukrainian governor of the eastern Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukrainian soldiers were preparing to retake the area, which borders the Kharkiv region and was has been mostly under Russian control since July. Intense shelling of Ukrainian forces continued, he said.\n\nHaidai told The Associated Press that Ukrainian troops were flying Ukrainian flags in the cities of Svatove and Starobilsk.\n\nBut in Kreminna, another city where Ukrainians raised their flag, Russians returned Wednesday and \"tore down the (Ukrainian) flags and are demonstrably showing that theyre there,\" Haidai said.\n\nA Russia-allied separatist military leader confirmed the Ukrainian advance on the Luhansk region. Andrei Marochko, a local militia officer, said on Russian TV that the situation was \"really difficult.\"\n\n\"In some places, the contact line has come very close to the borders of the Luhansk Peoples Republic,\" Marochko said, referring to the independent state the separatists declared eight years ago.\n\nThe counteroffensive has left more weapons in Ukrainian hands.\n\nRussian forces likely left behind dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers and other heavy weaponry as they fled Ukraines advance in the east, a Ukrainian think tank said Wednesday. The Center for Defense Strategies said one Russian unit fleeing the Izium area left behind more than three dozen T-80 tanks and about as many infantry fighting vehicles. Another unit left 47 tanks and 27 armored vehicles, it said.\n\nThe center said Russian forces tried to destroy some of the abandoned vehicles through artillery strikes as they fell back. Typically, armed forces ruin equipment left behind so their opponent cant use it. However, the chaos of the Russian withdrawal apparently forced them to abandon untouched ammunition and weapons.\n\nWith the recent Ukrainian gains, a new front line has emerged along the Oskil River, which largely traces the Kharkiv region's eastern edge, a Washington-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War, said Wednesday.\n\n\"Russian troops are unlikely to be strong enough to prevent further Ukrainian advances along the entire Oskil River because they do not appear to be receiving reinforcements, and Ukrainian troops will likely be able to exploit this weakness to resume the counteroffensive across the Oskil if they choose,\" the institute said.\n\nIn other areas, Russia continued its attacks, causing more casualties in a war that has dragged on for nearly seven months.\n\nTwo people were killed and three wounded after Russia attacked Mykolaiv with S-300 missiles overnight, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said.\n\nThe Nikopol area, across a river from the shutdown Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, was shelled three times during the night, with no injuries immediately reported, regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said.\n\nFighting also raged in the eastern Donetsk region, where shelling killed five civilians and wounded 16. Together, Luhansk and Donetsk make up the Donbas, an industrial area that Moscow set out to capture following an unsuccessful attempt to invade Kyiv.\n\nRussian troops are targeting critical infrastructure. Eight cruise missiles aimed at water equipment hit Zelenskyy's hometown of Kryvyi Rih, a city on the Inhulets River 150 kms (93 miles) southwest of Dnipro, the deputy head of the presidents office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on his Telegram channel. Zelenskyy said the strikes appeared to be an attempt to flood the city and that a dam on a reservoir was hit. Video posted online showed elevated water levels on the Inhulets and flooded city streets, and evacuations of residents were suggested.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden observed Wednesday that Ukrainian forces have made \"significant progress\" in recent days but added, \"I think its going to be a long haul.\"\n\nWhile criticism of the invasion seems to be increasing in Russia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, \"Unfortunately, I cannot tell you that the realization has grown over there by now that this was a mistake to start this war.\"\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that he had spoken with Putin about exporting Russian fertilizer through Ukraines Black Sea ports to address a famine threat. The U.N. chief said at a news conference in New York that high prices for fertilizer have reduced the planting of crops, making it critical to increase Russian exports of ammonia a key fertilizer ingredient by shipping it through Black Sea ports now used to transport grain from Ukraine.\n\nWestern military and economic support has allowed Ukraine to keep fighting since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, and the Ukrainian government received more assistance Wednesday.\n\nAn international group of creditors, including the U.S., finalized a deal to suspend Ukraines debt service through the end of 2023, helping the country ease liquidity pressures and increase social, health and economic spending.\n\n___\n\nArhirova reported from Kyiv.

They have so far not provided evidence of atrocities on the scale that was seen in Bucha.\n\nThe head of the Kharkiv prosecutors office, Oleksandr Filchakov, said bodies were found in Hrakove and Zaliznyche, villages around 60 kilometers (35 miles) southeast of Kharkiv.\n\nHe said investigators were also learning of residents being killed and buried by Russian troops in another retaken town, Balakliia.\n\nOn the northern outskirts of Izium, the remains of Russian tanks and vehicles lay shattered along the road.\n\nZelenskyy said that as Ukrainian soldiers retook villages, \"the life comes back.\"\n\nIn the wake of the recent gains, a new front line has started to emerge along the Oskil River that largely traces the eastern edge of the Kharkiv region, a Washington-based think thank said Wednesday.\n\n\"Russian troops are unlikely to be strong enough to prevent further Ukrainian advances along the entire Oskil River because they do not appear to be receiving reinforcements, and Ukrainian troops will likely be able to exploit this weakness to resume the counteroffensive across the Oskil if they choose,\" the Institute for the Study of War said.\n\nThe counteroffensive has also left more weapons in Ukrainian hands.\n\nRussian forces likely left behind dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers and other heavy weaponry as they fled Ukraines advance in the east of the country, a Ukrainian think tank said Wednesday.\n\nThe Center for Defense Strategies said one single Russian unit that was around Izium left behind more than three dozen T-80 tanks and about as many infantry fighting vehicles known by the acronym BMP. Another unit left behind 47 tanks and 27 armored vehicles.\n\nThe center said Russian forces tried to destroy some of the abandoned vehicles through artillery strikes as they fell back. Typically, armed forces destroy equipment left behind so their opponent cant use it.\n\nHowever, the chaos of the Russian withdrawal apparently saw them leave untouched ammunition and weapons behind.\n\nIn other areas, Russia continued its attacks, causing the death toll to keep rising in a war that has dragged on for nearly seven months.\n\nWATCH: Pentagon press secretary Pat Ryder speaks on Ukraine counteroffensive\n\nRussian shelling of seven Ukrainian regions over the past 24 hours killed at least seven civilians and wounded 22 more, Ukraines presidential office reported on Wednesday morning.\n\nTwo people were killed and three wounded after Russia attacked Mykolaiv with S-300 missiles overnight, said regional Gov. Vitaliy Kim. Settlements near the front line in Mykolaiv region remain under constant fire.\n\nThe Nikopol area, which is across a river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, was shelled three times during the night, but no injuries were immediately reported, said regional Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko. Nikopol city itself was shelled two times and left almost 3,000 families without electricity. Reznichenko said the electricity has been partially restored.\n\nIn the Luhansk region, where some of the Russian troops went after retreating from the Kharkiv region, mobile internet has been shut down, according to the regions governor Serhiy Haidai, and intense shelling of Ukrainian forces continues.\n\nThe fighting continued in the neighboring Donetsk region, where shelling killed five civilians and wounded 16 more. Together, Luhansk and Donetsk make up the Donbas.\n\n\"Every night in Donbas is restless. The civilians should leave the region. Its a matter of life and death,\" Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.\n\nArhirova reported from Kyiva. Associated Press journalist Jon Gambrell in Kyiv contributed.",

                "cc_text": "watch now\n\nUkraine's surprise counterattack in the northeast of the country has sent shock waves through the Russian army, with military strategists saying occupying forces have likely been forced to pull out of the entire region around Kharkiv. This crucial area is home to Ukraine's second-largest city and lies close to the border with Russia. This should have made it easier for Russia to defend, but Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Sunday that its forces had been able to recapture dozens of towns and villages in the area over the last few days. These include the strategically important town of Izyum, which Russia had used as a base for its forces in the region, and Kupiansk, a key railway hub in the area. The territorial gains for Ukraine come after its forces launched a series of counterattacks in the northeast last week. The surprise move caught Russia off guard; the Kremlin had redeployed many troops to southern Ukraine for a much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive there. Instead, strategists now widely believe that Ukraine had planned to use the Russian redeployment of troops as an opportunity to redouble its efforts in the northeast of the country.\n\nKharkiv matters\n\nKharkiv lies 30 miles from the Russian border, just above the strategically important Donbas area in eastern Ukraine where two pro-Russian, self-proclaimed \"republics\" are located, in Donetsk and Luhansk. Despite this proximity, however, Moscow's forces have not been able to occupy the city since they started their unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Since its initial wholescale attack on Ukraine was scaled back, with Russian forces withdrawing from the area around the capital Kyiv in April, Russia has claimed it wants to \"liberate\" the Donbas.\n\nA military truck bearing Russia invasion forces' \"Z\" symbol lies blasted in the town of Balakliya, which Ukrainian troops liberated over the weekend. Anadolu Agency | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nAs such, the loss of key towns and villages in the Kharkiv region makes Russia's hold on territory in Luhansk (which it claims to fully occupy) and Donetsk (where it has made small advances over the summer) more vulnerable, and casts further doubt on Moscow's ability to achieve its aim in the Donbas. For its part, Ukraine has repeatedly reiterated that it aims to reclaim all its lost territory including the Donbas and Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Strategists at the Institute for the Study of War noted on Sunday that, \"Ukrainian leaders discussed the strikes in the south much more ostentatiously, however, successfully confusing the Russians about their intentions in Kharkiv Oblast [province].\" It noted that Ukraine had executed a \"skillful campaign,\" maximizing the impact of Western weapons systems such as HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, donated by the U.S.) to attack Russian ground lines of communication in both Kharkiv and Kherson.\n\nA Russian armored vehicle that was captured by Ukrainian troops is hauled out of Kharkiv on Sept. 8, 2022. Metin Atkas | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nOn Sunday, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said the counteroffensive was ongoing, while the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said forces had reclaimed 3,000 square kilometers (around 1,158 square miles) of Russian-occupied territory already this month, and are now pushing Russian forces back toward the border with Ukraine. \"In the Kharkiv direction, we began to advance not only to the south and east, but also to the north,\" Zaluzhnyi said, adding that Ukrainian forces are now about 50 kilometers (around 30 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nRussians 'retreating'\n\nRussian troops stationed at Balakleya and Izyum had regrouped and been redeployed in the direction of Donetsk in order to \"boost efforts\" there, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told reporters Saturday, according to Russian state news agency Tass. The U.K.'s Ministry of Defense noted Monday that Russian troops were likely retreating from much of the Kharkiv region, although pockets of resistance remained. \"In the face of Ukrainian advances, Russia has likely ordered the withdrawal of its troops from the entirety of occupied Kharkiv Oblast west of the Oskil River,\" the ministry said on Twitter, adding that since the counterattacks began in earnest last Wednesday, \"Ukraine has recaptured territory at least twice the size of Greater London.\"\n\nThe 'Z', the symbol of the Russian forces, and the inscription 'ZSU', which is the abbreviation of the initials of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Cyrillic alphabet, is seen on a military vehicle as Russia-Ukraine war continues in Kharkiv, Ukraine on September 09, 2022. Metin Aktas | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nStrategists have said that while Ukraine appears to have used Russia's redeployment of troops to the south as an opportunity to attack in the northeast, its counteroffensive around Kherson in the south is not a \"feint\" or mock attack designed to distract attention. \"Ukrainian forces have reportedly attacked and made gains at several important locations on the western bank of the Dnipro River,\" the Institute for the Study of War noted Sunday, adding that, \"Ukraine has committed considerable combat power and focused a significant portion of the Western-supplied long-range precision systems it has to this axis, and it is not likely to have done so merely to draw Russian forces to the area.\"\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nMilitary strategists are keen to point out that while Ukraine has been successful in its initial counteroffensives both in the northeast and south of the country, the war is nowhere near an end. Dmitry Gorenburg, senior research scientist at the security research and analysis organization CNA, said that Russian commanders would be reluctant to withdraw their forces from occupied territory even in a bid to preserve those forces. This would be a \"political black eye\" for Moscow, he told CNBC. \"It really seems like the Russian forces have exhausted themselves in terms of their ability to to make advances. They haven't really gained any territory to speak of since since that last push in Luhansk in late June, early July,\" Gorenburg noted. On the other hand, Ukraine is likely to make \"continued efforts\" to regain territory, he added. \"They see this as a long-term gradual process.\"\n\nThis photograph shows a destroyed Russian military vehicle in Balakliya, a town in the Kharkiv region that was recaptured by Ukrainian forces. Juan Barreto | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe U.K.'s Defense Ministry said in its assessment of the situation that \"the rapid Ukrainian successes have significant implications for Russia's overall operational design\" with the majority of the forces in Ukraine \"highly likely being forced to prioritise emergency defensive actions.\" \"The already limited trust deployed troops have in Russia's senior military leadership is likely to deteriorate further,\" the ministry added. Ukraine's pressure on Russian forces in Kherson, combined with the rapid counteroffensive in Kharkiv, \"presents the Russians with a terrible dilemma of time and space,\" according to analysis by the Institute for the Study of War. It said Russia could risk losing Luhansk, as well as having to retreat from neighboring Donetsk.\n\nwatch now",

Russia confirmed its forces' retreat from both towns, which it said would allow them to \"regroup\".\n\nValerii Marchenko, mayor of Izyum, told the BBC the Ukrainian army was in his city and the state flag had been raised.\n\nThe military is now engaged in cleaning up the war-torn city and Ukrainian forces are searching for Russian soldiers potentially hiding in people's houses.\n\nMr Marchenko said that after \"about 10 days\", residents who had to flee the city would be able to return \"safely\".\n\nRussia has been accused of targeting civilian infrastructure in revenge for setbacks on the battlefield.\n\nA wave of missile strikes on Sunday caused power cuts across the region.\n\nWatch: Widespread blackouts in Ukraine\n\nThe blackouts reportedly affected millions of people in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions.\n\nUkraine's Defence Minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said the priority now was to secure the territorial gains made in a week of rapid advances in the Kharkiv region.\n\nThe White House said Ukraine's troops were \"fighting hard\" and pledged ongoing backing from the US as Ukrainian forces \"continue to defend their democracy against Russian aggression\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian army appears to have abandoned large quantities of equipment and ammunition as it withdrew from areas it had held since the first weeks of the war.\n\nAnd a Russian battle-tank maker has switched to \"round-the-clock\" production after these setbacks, according to reports.\n\nWorkers at Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil, Russia's largest armoured vehicle manufacturer, have reportedly not been allowed to go on vacation due to the \"production necessity\".\n\nUkraine's rapid gains stun Russia\n\nBy Hugo Bachega, BBC News, Kyiv\n\nUkraine's rapid progress seems to have stunned Russia. The Kremlin says its troops are regrouping, but pictures from some liberated areas in the Kharkiv region suggest a hasty departure by the invading forces, with military vehicles, ammunition, and equipment left behind.\n\nIf the gains are confirmed - and if they hold - it's the most significant change on the frontlines since Russian troops left the Kyiv region five months ago. The extraordinary advance would mark a humiliating setback for Russia, and be a boost to Ukraine's position that it can push the Russians out while asking for more Western weapons.\n\nPresident Zelensky has talked about a possible breakthrough, suggesting that more advances could happen before winter. But the country still faces huge challenges. Around a fifth of it remains under occupation and, in the south, Ukrainian troops have reportedly faced more resistance in their offensive, as Russia has fortified its positions.",

All times EDT.\n\n10:09 p.m.: The fighting in eastern Ukraine comes amid an ongoing offensive around Kherson in the south, the Associated Press reported. Analysts suggest Russia may have taken soldiers from the east to reinforce around Kherson, offering the Ukrainians the opportunity to strike a weakened front line.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told the television channel Ukraina that the Russians had no food or fuel for their troops in the area as Kyiv had cut off their supply lines.\n\n\"It will be like an avalanche,\" he said, predicting a Russian fallback. \"One line of defense will shake and it will fall.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian military was more circumspect about the reported gains, claiming Saturday to have taken \"more than 1,000 square kilometers\" from pro-Kremlin forces this week. It said \"in some areas, units of the Defense Forces have penetrated the enemys defenses to a depth of 50 kilometers,\" matching the British assessment, but did not disclose geographical details.\n\n9:18 p.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, referencing the sweeping Ukrainian gains, estimating that Kyiv has seized around 2,500 square kilometers in its eastern breakthrough, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe institute said it appeared that \"disorganized Russian forces (were) caught in the rapid Ukrainian advance.\" They cited social media images of apparent Russian prisoners seized in the advance around Izyum and surrounding towns.\n\n8:34 p.m.: The success of a counter-offensive against Russia shows Ukraine can beat Moscow's forces, but Kyiv needs more weapons from its partners, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Saturday, according to Reuters.\n\nKuleba, speaking at a news conference with visiting German counterpart Annalena Baerbock, said some allies had initially been hesitant to send weapons, citing the risk of antagonizing Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Now, thank God, we are no longer hearing this argument. ... We have demonstrated we are capable of defeating the Russian army. We are doing that with weapons given to us,\" he said.\n\n\"And so I reiterate: the more weapons we receive, the faster we will win, and the faster this war will end.\"\n\n7:25 p.m.: Russian troops are regrouping from the Balakliya and Izyum areas to the eastern Donetsk region, Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said, the Associated Press reported.\n\nKonashenkov said the Russian move was being made \"in order to achieve the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbas,\" an eastern area home to two separatist regions that Russia has declared sovereign.\n\nIgor Girkin, a Russian who was an early leader of a Moscow-backed separatist uprising in Donetsk in 2014, sneered at the portrayal of the pullback being strategic.\n\nOn the messaging app Telegram, he acidly called it \"the brilliant (clearly within the framework of the plan and even ahead of schedule) operation to transfer the cities of Izyum, Balakliya and Kupiansk to respected Ukrainian partners.\"\n\n6:50 p.m.: In Hrakove, one of dozens of villages recaptured in the Ukrainian advance, Reuters reporters saw burned-out vehicles bearing the \"Z\" symbol of Russia's invasion. Boxes still full of ammunition were scattered with strewn rubbish in positions the Russians had abandoned in evident haste.\n\n\"Hello everyone, we are from Russia,\" was spray painted on a wall. Three bodies lay in white body bags in a yard.\n\nThe regional chief of police, Volodymyr Tymoshenko, said Ukrainian police had moved in the previous day, and had checked the identities of local residents who had lived under Russian occupation since the invasion's second day.\n\n\"The first function is to provide help that they need. The next job is to document the crimes committed by Russian invaders on the territories which they temporarily occupied.\"\n\n5:37 p.m.: Ukrainian officials stopped short of confirming they had recaptured Izyum, Reuters reported, but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak posted a photo of troops on its outskirts. Earlier, he tweeted an emoji of grapes. The city's name means raisin.\n\nThe Russian withdrawal announcement came hours after Ukrainian troops captured the city of Kupiansk further north, the sole railway hub supplying Russia's entire frontline across northeastern Ukraine. That left thousands of Russian troops abruptly cut off from supplies across a stretch of front that has seen some of the most intense battles of the war.\n\nThere were signs of trouble for Russia elsewhere along its remaining positions at the front in the east, with pro-Russian officials acknowledging difficulties at other locations and Ukrainians hinting at more advances to come.\n\n4:40 p.m.: Moscow abandoned, Izyum, its main bastion in northeastern Ukraine on Saturday, in a sudden collapse on one of the war's principal front lines after surging Ukrainian forces threatened to encircle the area in a shock advance, Reuters reported.\n\nThe swift fall of Izyum in Kharkiv province was Moscow's worst defeat since its troops were forced back from the capital Kyiv in March, and could prove a decisive turning point in the six-month war, with thousands of Russian soldiers abandoning ammunition stockpiles and equipment as they flee.\n\nThe state-run TASS news agency quoted Russia's defense ministry as saying it had ordered troops to leave the vicinity to reinforce operations elsewhere in neighboring Donetsk.\n\n3:51 p.m.: Earlier Saturday, the British Defense Ministry told reporters it believed the Ukrainians had advanced as much as 50 kilometers south of Kharkiv, and described Russian forces around Izyum as \"increasingly isolated,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"Russian forces were likely taken by surprise. The sector was only lightly held and Ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns,\" the British military said, adding that the loss of Kupiansk would greatly affect Russian supply lines.\n\n2:45 p.m.: Ukraine's armed forces have liberated around 2,000 square kilometers of territory since a counter-offensive against Russia started earlier this month, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address Saturday.\n\n1:05 p.m.: Residents in Russian-controlled parts of the Kharkiv region have been advised to evacuate to Russia, according to the state-run news agency Tass.\n\nThe areas Russian-installed administrator Vitaly Ganchev reportedly said doing so would \"save lives.\"\n\nThe advisory comes after Russia's defense ministry said it was pulling troops out of two key towns in the region as Ukrainian forces made rapid advances. The towns, Izyum and Balakliya, have been crucial military supply hubs for the Russians.\n\nAndrey Turchak, a senior official in the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, said a volunteer corps had been deployed to help those fleeing Ukraine for Russia, and reported more than 400 vehicles at the border.\n\n12:30 p.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he has spoken with French President Emmanuel Macron about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, among other issues.\n\n\"Our position is the only way to protect Europe from a nuclear disaster is to demilitarize the plant,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\n11:30 a.m.: Russias Defense Ministry announced Saturday that it was \"regrouping\" its forces in the eastern Kharkiv region of Ukraine following Kyivs claims its troops had made sweeping gains in the territory held for months by Russias army.\n\n\"To achieve the goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbas, a decision was made to regroup Russian troops stationed in the Balakliya and Izyum regions, to bolster efforts along the Donetsk front,\" the defense ministry said in a statement.\n\n11:08 a.m.: Ukrainian troops were also advancing further east near the village of Hrakove, near the Russian border, in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, reports Agence France-Presse.\n\nA military spokesperson said Ukrainian solders pushed dozens of kilometers into territory captured by Russian troops at the beginning of the invasion.\n\nRussian news agencies meanwhile reported six large explosions in Nova Kakhovka, a town held by Russian troops in the southern Kherson region.\n\n10:25 a.m.: Ukraines Ministry of Defense released video showing Ukrainian military members raising Ukraine's national flag and singing the national anthem, in Balakliya, in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, partially occupied by Russian forces, reports Reuters.\n\nThe news agency was able to verify the location of video from the buildings and statues seen in the video which matched file imagery of the area. Reuters was not able to establish when the video was recorded. Earlier, Ukrainian Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov said troops had advanced up to 50 kilometers behind Russian lines and recaptured more than 20 villages in the Kharkiv region.\n\nIf the advances are confirmed, it would be a serious blow for Russia, which Western intelligence services say has suffered huge casualties. It would also represent a big boost for Ukraine, which is keen to show its Western backers that it is capable of changing the situation on the ground by force and deserves continued support.\n\n9:40 a.m.: Two young soldiers who died fighting for Russia in Ukraine were honored with the unveiling of memorial plaques at the school they attended in Crimea, reports Reuters.\n\nRelatives, students and local officials held a ceremony to commemorate Denis Varavin and Yevgeny Petelko, with young people marching in an honor guard with a Russian tricolor flag and shots fired into the air to salute the two men's memory.\n\nThe inscriptions on both plaques read: \"True to his oath, he perished while fulfilling his military duty in the course of the special military operation\" - the term used by President Vladimir Putin to describe Russia's military campaign in Ukraine.\n\n8:10 a.m.: German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock arrived in Kyiv Saturday on a surprise visit, reports Agence France-Presse.\n\nIt is her second trip to Ukraine and comes a week after Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal's trip to Berlin where he had repeated Kyiv's call for weapons.\n\n\"I have travelled to Kyiv today to show that they can continue to rely on us. That we will continue to stand by Ukraine for as long as necessary with deliveries of weapons, and with humanitarian and financial support,\" Baerbock said in a statement.\n\nOver the last weeks, Germany has sent howitzers, rocket launchers and anti-aircraft missiles to Kyiv. Heavier weapons like anti-aircraft systems, rocket launchers mounted on pick-ups and anti-drone equipment are also due in a further military aid package.\n\n7:35 a.m.: Ukrainian forces report they have entered the town of Kupiansk in eastern Ukraine, a key supply hub that had been held by invading Russian forces for several months, reports Agence France-Presse. Ukrainian special forces Saturday published images on social media, which they said showed their officers \"in Kupiansk, which was and will always be Ukrainian.\" A regional official separately posted an image of Ukrainian soldiers in the town of around 27,000 people.\n\n5:30 a.m.: The latest Ukraine assessment from the Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said the Kremlin is rushing resources to Kharkiv Oblast in response to effective Ukrainian operations.\n\nUkrainian forces, the update said, may have advanced north of Hrushivka towards a Russian logistics hub in Velykyi Burluk, northeastern Kharkiv Oblast. Ukrainian forces are also continuing counteroffensive operations in southern Ukraine, including interdicting Russian GLOCS, degrading Russian morale.\n\n4:30 a.m.: The United States is working with the United Nations to address Russian complaints that sanctions are hindering its food and fertilizer shipments, even though there has been no disruption to Moscow's exports of the commodities, a senior U.S. official said Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe United Nations, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia agreed on July 22 on what was described by U.N. chief Antonio Guterres as a package deal to restart Ukraine's Black Sea grain and fertilizer exports and facilitate Russian shipments.\n\n\"We're seeing no disruption in Russia's ability to send food to market,\" James O'Brien, head of the State Department's Office of Sanctions Coordination, told reporters. \"The fertilizer is still reaching markets at the same rate that it always has.\"\n\nWhile the United States and others have stressed that Russian food and fertilizer is not subject to sanctions imposed over Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbor, Russia has asserted there has been a chilling effect on its exports.\n\nO'Brien said the United States would do \"everything we can\" to address specific complaints and \"Russia and the U.N. are just now engaged on some specific requests that it has under the U.N. agreement, and I think we'll see progress in that over the next few weeks.\"\n\n3:32 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said a Russian force around Izium is likely increasingly isolated. Ukrainian units are now threatening the town of Kupiansk; its capture would be a significant blow to Russia because it sits on supply routes to the Donbas front line, the update said.\n\nWith Ukrainian operations also continuing in Kherson, the update said, the Russian defensive front is under pressure on both its northern and southern flanks.\n\n2:24 a.m.: The United States is deeply concerned by the Russian government's treatment of jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nRussian prison authorities have interfered with Navalny's preparation of his defense and communication with his lawyer, Price said in a statement. He also said Navalny has been repeatedly placed in solitary confinement for minor alleged infractions.\n\nPrice said Navalny's treatment was \"evidence of politically motivated harassment,\" and he reiterated U.S. calls for the opposition leader's immediate release.\n\nNavalny, President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critic inside Russia, is serving an 11-year sentence after being found guilty of parole violations and fraud and contempt of court charges. He says all charges against him were fabricated as a pretext to smother dissent and thwart his political ambitions.\n\n1:19 a.m.: The European Commission on Friday urged EU member states to reassess the terms on which they grant visas to Russian travelers and to root out applicants that pose a security threat, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"We should not be naive, Putin's aim is to destroy the EU and he would like to attack us where we are weakest,\" warned EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson.\n\nShe told a news conference in Nuijamaa near Finland's border with Russia, that Moscow was responsible for an unprovoked war in Ukraine and warned that civilians could act as spies, saboteurs or provocateurs.\n\nOn Friday, the EU formally suspended a 2007 visa facilitation pact that had made it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to Europe but stopped short of the full travel ban demanded by some member states.\n\n12:02 a.m.: The Kremlin said on Friday that President Vladimir Putin will discuss with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a landmark deal allowing grain exports from Ukraine that Russia has repeatedly criticized, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThe agreement between Russia and Ukraine, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations in July, designated three ports for Kyiv to send much-needed grain supplies through a Russian blockade.\n\nBut Russia has voiced increasing criticism of the deal, saying its own exports have suffered. Putin this week claimed most of the consignments were arriving in Europe, not poor countries where grain was needed most.\n\nUkrainian officials have denied the claim and data compiled by a monitoring group as part of the accord does not reflect Putin's assertion.\n\nSome information in this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\nUkrainian officials say the military has made sweeping gains in a counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region, with President Volodymyr Zelensky asserting that a key city in the region has been reclaimed by Ukrainian forces and that Russian offensives across the country are being repelled.\n\nZelensky posted a video on his social media accounts with Ukrainian soldiers standing above a building in the key Kharkiv city of Balakliia, which was under Russian occupation for six months, alongside the Ukrainian flag.\n\n\"The order is fulfilled. Russian occupational troops have withdrawn,\" one of the soldiers says in the video.\n\nA video posted on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Facebook page on Thursday September 8, claims his soldiers have retaken the key Kharkiv city of Balakliia. President of Ukraine\n\nUkrainian troops have also reached the city of Kupyansk in the Kharkiv region a key logistics and supply hub for Russian forces according to a photo showing Ukrainian soldiers holding a flag in front of a signpost at the southern entrance of the city, geolocated by CNN. Ukrainian forces have not yet retaken the city, which is roughly 70 miles (112 kilometers) east of Kharkiv.\n\nRussian military bloggers and analysts have said that Ukrainian forces push towards Kupyansk aims to cut off supply lines to the strategic city of Izium to the south. Usually supportive of the Russian campaign in Ukraine, many have criticized Moscows failure to predict a Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv, and the lack of troops and equipment in numbers capable of stopping a Ukrainian push.\n\nIn a nightly address Thursday, Zelensky claimed the countrys military had retaken more than 1,000 square kilometers of territory since the beginning of the month. Oleksii Hromov, the deputy head of the main operations directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said Ukrainian forces were able to advance 50 kilometers (about 31 miles) in the Kharkiv region and liberate \"more than 20 settlements.\"\n\nThrough geolocation and the statements of the Ukrainian military, independent analysts and Russian military bloggers, its estimated that Ukrainian forces have taken well over 400 square kilometers of territory this week in the Kharkiv region.\n\nMeanwhile, some Russian troops in the Kharkiv region have deserted and abandoned their uniforms due to Russias \"significant losses,\" the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said, adding that the soldiers are hoping to blend in while wearing civilian clothing.\n\n\"Personnel of the occupying forces in civilian clothes resort to desertion and try to return to the territory of the Russian Federation,\" the General Staff said in a situational update Friday, claiming that 15 such cases had been observed.\n\nThe Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that the Russian 202nd Motorized Rifle Regiment, \"located in the Kharkiv region, withdrew from their positions and moved to the nearest forest. The unit was left without commanders and communications.\"\n\nThe Directorate claimed that Russian soldiers were \"calling to relatives with requests to contact the command and find out where they should go next. Some of them ask their wives to contact the hotlines of the Ministry of Defense of Russia and the Red Cross with the demand to remove them from the territory of Ukraine.\"\n\nIt provided no evidence for the assertion.\n\nCounteroffensives on two fronts\n\nWhile the southern front, in Kherson region, looks set to be one of the main theaters of conflict as the war heads towards winter, a new Ukrainian push in Kharkiv could stretch Russian forces across two disparate locations.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russia redeployed some forces to the south to bolster its ranks ahead of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson region, according to Ukrainian officials and footage of equipment moving through Crimea geolocated by CNN.\n\nOn Wednesday, Zelensky thanked units stationed in southern Ukraine what he called \"extremely successful hits\" on occupying Russian forces, while the simultaneous counterattack was launched in the north.\n\n\"The more difficult it is for the occupiers, the more losses they have, the better the positions for our defenders in Donbas will be, the more reliable the defense of Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and the cities of Dnipropetrovsk region will be, the faster we will be able to liberate the Azov region and the entire south,\" he said.\n\nUkraine continues to press on with its southern counteroffensive; Ukrainian forces are making gains in the south, with the ambitious goal of taking back most of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson by the end of the year, senior US officials and Ukrainian officials told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThe last week has seen the most ambitious ground assaults by the Ukrainians since the beginning of the invasion, following sustained attacks on command posts, ammunition stores, and fuel reserves far behind the front lines, according to geolocation of video and satellite imagery.\n\nThe US has observed Ukrainian forces achieve some success in attacking Russian supply lines, with the intention of cutting off and isolating Russian troops currently deployed west of the Dnipro River, according to a senior US official.",

                "cc_text": "Moscow has long used proxy leaders to provide a facade of independent legitimacy for territory it controls and it did so after occupying territory in the east of Ukraine in 2014.\n\nMany of the personnel in the militaries of the breakaway Russian-backed states of Donetsk and Luhansk are Ukrainian. The leader of the provisional government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin and head of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peoples Republic since 2018, Leonid Pasechnik, are both Ukrainian.\n\nThis tactic has been used again in areas taken by Russian forces since the February 24 invasion. As soon as a territory was occupied by Russian forces, Moscow replaced elected representatives and installed pro-Russian proxies to run the administrations.\n\nBut Moscow has often been unable to find popular candidates to fill the roles and one of the reasons for this is that it has become fairly dangerous to collaborate. According to a tally compiled by wartranslated.com, a volunteer project that translates reports about the war into English, there have been 19 attacks on pro-Russian Ukrainian officials since March this year.\n\nThese reports were confirmed by the Moscow Times, an independent English-language newspaper which has been edited from Amsterdam since earlier this year when Russia passed laws effectively criminalising reporting about the war in Ukraine.\n\nKillings in Kherson\n\nMany of these have been in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, where Kyiv has recently begun a counteroffensive. Among them was Alexey Kovalev, the deputy leader of Kherson, who was found shot to death in his home in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian town of Hola Prystan.\n\nA former Ukrainian MP, Kovalev announced in June that he was now working with the Russian invaders. His girlfriend was reportedly also badly injured with a stab wound to her neck.\n\nKovalevs killing at the end of August followed what appears to be the attempted assassination of his boss, the leader of Russian-occupied Kherson, Vladimir Saldo. Saldo was reportedly taken to a hospital in Crimea and then to a toxicology unit in Moscow apparently suffering the effects of poisoning. Saldo was reportedly also the target of a car bomb in July, which was \"discovered and defused in time\".\n\nThe day after Saldo was allegedly poisoned, another pro-Moscow official in Kherson, Vitaly Gura, was shot outside his home and died in hospital later. Another pro-Moscow official, Igor Telegin deputy head of domestic policy for Kherson region managed to survive a car bombing.\n\nReports are linking these attacks to the build-up to the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson, which began in earnest last week. But it has become increasingly apparent that life as a Russian-installed official in Ukraine is dangerous.\n\nThe referendum in Kherson on joining the Russian Federation had been postponed due to the security situation. The announcement was made by the deputy head of the pro-Russian administration in Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, who told Russias Tass news agency: \"We are not running before the hounds and are focused on our key task - to feed people, to ensure their security.\" However, Stremousov reportedly made his announcement by video from a hotel in the Russian city of Voronezh, although he denied fleeing and claimed he was working there.\n\nThere have been killings and attempted assassinations of officials in other Russian-controlled territories. In Berdyansk, in the Zaporizhzhia region of eastern Ukraine where Russian troops are occupying Europes largest nuclear plant, the deputy chief of police, Alexander Kolesnikov died on August 26 after being targeted by a roadside bomb.\n\nSimilarly, Ivan Sushko, the Russian-appointed head of the occupied village of Mykhailivka in Zaporizhzhia, was also killed by a car bomb, as was Yevgeny Yushakov, head of the administration of the Veliky Burluk in Kharkov. Oleg Shostak, head of the propaganda unit in occupied Melitopol, was badly injured by a car bomb.\n\nCreating fear among quislings\n\nUkraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has let it be known that any \"Gauleiter\" the slang being used to refer to collaborating Ukrainian officials, taken from the word used for district officials in Nazi Germany will be caught and punished.\n\nThe word has particular significance for Ukrainians. During the second world war, when Ukraine was occupied by German troops, many anti-Soviet Ukrainians fought alongside them against Ukrainian partisans.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has been training irregular units made up of civilians who have volunteered to take up arms against the invasion. Over the six months of the war, civilian resistance in occupied regions has moved on from putting up posters and hanging Russian uniforms from high street signs. Now, in addition to the assassinations, there are reports that informal resistance units are mounting major operations.\n\nAccording to an unnamed adviser to Zelensky, quoted in the Guardian, the attack on Crimeas Saky airbase on August 11 involved such partisans, although this has yet to be confirmed. The attack destroyed at least nine Russian warplanes and was a major propaganda coup for Kyiv, showing that Ukraine could take the war to the Russians. Partisan groups are thought to be operating in tandem with Ukraines special forces, created in 2015 to recuit partisans and operate in Russian-controlled areas.\n\nThese attacks and assassinations are attempting to create an atmosphere of fear for any Ukrainians who have chosen to switch sides and work on behalf of the occupying forces.\n\nUkrainian prosecutors have said they are working to identify Ukrainians siding with the Russians. In June it was announced that 480 individuals were under investigation for collaborating. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol told Newsweek that Russian troops would kill collaborators when they had no further use for them.\n\nAs Kyivs counteroffensive unfolds across southern Ukraine, there is no doubt a growing number of pro-Russian officials who are hearing these warnings and becoming increasingly apprehensive.",

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nUkraines southern counteroffensive is continuing to have significant impacts on Russian morale and military capabilities in southern Ukraine. Satellite imagery of known Russian positions in Kyselivka, 15km northwest of Kherson City, shows that all but four Russian vehicles have departed from previous forward positions, consistent with rumors that Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) troops have abandoned Kyselivka and moved back towards the Dnipro River.[i] Kyselivka is an operationally significant location for Russian forces around Kherson City because it is the last major settlement along both the E58 highway and a railway line between current Ukrainian positions and Chornobaivka, the outermost part of Kherson City. The apparent withdrawal of Russian troops from this position may compromise the Russians ability to defend the northwestern outskirts of Kherson City and suggests that Russian troops in this area perceive an imminent threat to their positions. Spokesperson for Ukraines Southern Operational Command, Natalya Humenyuk, stated on September 12 that Russian forces located along the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast are attempting to negotiate for surrender under the auspices of international law.[ii] Ukrainian operations in Kharkiv Oblast are unlikely to have had such a dramatic psychological effect on Russian troops this far south, and both the withdrawal of troops from forward positions in Kyselivka and reports of surrender negotiations are indicators that Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south are progressing in a significant way, even if visibility on this axis is limited by the shift in focus to Kharkiv.\n\nThe success of recent Ukrainian counteroffensive operations may be impacting the will or ability of the Russian military command to use newly formed volunteer units in Ukraine in a timely fashion. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that the Russian military command has suspended sending new, already-formed units to Ukraine due to recent Russian losses and widespread distrust of the Russian military command, factors which have caused a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse to participate in combat.[iii] This assessment is still unconfirmed, but low morale due to Ukrainian counteroffensive success may prove devastating to the Kremlins already-poor ability to generate meaningful combat capability. The deployment of these newly formed units to reinforce defensive lines against Ukrainian counteroffensives would be an operationally-sound decision on the part of Russian military leadership; and the delay or potential suspension of these deployments will afford Ukrainian troops time to consolidate and then resume the offensive, should they choose to do so, without having to face newly arrived and fresh (albeit undertrained and understrength) units.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nUkrainian forces are continuing to make impactful gains in Kherson Oblast and are steadily degrading the morale and combat capabilities of Russian forces in this area.\n\nThe Russian military command may be suspending the deployment of newly formed units to Ukraine due to recent Russian losses and overall degraded morale.\n\nRussian forces are failing to reinforce the new frontline following Ukrainian gains in eastern Kharkiv Oblast and are actively fleeing the area or redeploying to other axes.\n\nUkrainian forces continued targeting Russian military assets and positions in Kherson Oblast, likely steadily degrading them.\n\nThe Ukrainian recapture of Izyum has likely degraded Russian forces ability to conduct artillery strikes along the Izyum-Slovyansk highway.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced the restoration of the second reserve power transmission line to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).\n\nUkraines sweeping counteroffensive is damaging Russian administrative capabilities and driving Russian departures from occupied parts of Ukraine far behind the line of contact.\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives Southern and Eastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main Effort Eastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and two supporting efforts)\n\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort- Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting Effort- Southern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Vovchansk-Kupyansk-Izyum-Lyman Line)\n\nUkrainian forces continued to consolidate gains in eastern Kharkiv Oblast on September 12. The Kharkiv Oblast detachment of Ukrainian Azov Regiment Special Forces stated that Ukrainian troops have taken control of the entire northeastern part of Kharkiv Oblast along the Vesele-Vovchansk line.[iv] Ukrainian sources confirmed that Ukrainian troops have retaken Dvorchina (100km east of Kharkiv City) and Ternova (30km northeast of Kharkiv City), demonstrating the range of the Ukrainian advance in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast.[v] Ukraines Airborne Assault Command also claimed that Ukrainian paratroopers took control of Bohorodychne, a small settlement in northwestern Donetsk Oblast directly along the southeastern Kharkiv Oblast border.[vi] Geolocated imagery additionally shows that Ukrainian troops have taken full control of Sviatohirsk, 3km due east of Bohorodychne.[vii]\n\nRussian sources claimed that the front has largely stabilized at the Oskil River, which runs just west of the Kharkiv-Luhansk Oblast border.[viii] Russian milbloggers reported that Ukrainian and Russian forces are fighting around Lyman, but that Lyman remains under the control of Russian and proxy forces.[ix] Some Russian sources also voiced concerns that Ukrainian troops are trying to cross the Siverskyi Donets River around Zakitne (about 15km southeast of Lyman) to take back Yampil.[x] Russian sources are seemingly focused on the Lyman-Yampil line as the next potential target for Ukrainian advances.\n\nRussian forces are failing to reinforce the new frontline following Ukrainian gains in eastern Kharkiv Oblast and are actively fleeing the area or redeploying to other axes. Ukrainian sources claimed that all Russian forces have left Svatove, Luhansk Oblast (about 45km east of current Ukrainian positions along the Oskil River), and that only militia elements of the Luhansk Peoples Republic (LNR)possibly localsremain in Svatove.[xi] Social media footage shows lines of cars stretching for kilometers near Schastia and Stanysia Luhanska, which are both along the border of long-held LNR territory and close to the Russian border.[xii] Russian forces and pro-Russian collaborators are likely experiencing the psychological pressure of rapid Ukrainian gains and seek to remove themselves from settlements near the new frontline that they perceive as vulnerable to Ukrainian advances. Certain proxy forces are also reportedly already redeploying from Kharkiv Oblast to southwestern Donetsk Oblast, indicating that the Russian command is not prioritizing reinforcing vulnerable positions east of the Oskil River.[xiii]\n\nSouthern Ukraine: (Kherson Oblast)\n\nUkrainian military officials emphasized on September 12 that Ukrainian troops are making tangible gains in Kherson Oblast. Ukraines Kakhovka Operational Group announced that Ukrainian forces have penetrated the front line at depths between 4 and 12km in unspecified areas, amounting to over 500 square kilometers of liberated territory.[xiv] The Kakhovka Group stated that Ukrainian troops have liberated 13 settlements, including Vysokopillya, Novovoznesenske, Bilohirka, Sukhyi Stavok, and Myrolubivka.[xv] Ukrainian military officials also stated that Ukrainian troops are continuing an operational interdiction campaign and regularly striking Russian military, logistical, and transportation assets in southern Ukraine.[xvi] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that the Russian 810th Naval Infantry Brigade has lost more than 85% of its personnel and is now refusing to return to combat, suggesting that even brigade-level elements have suffered substantial losses as a result of the Ukrainian counteroffensive.[xvii]\n\nSocial media footage taken by residents of Kherson Oblast provides further visual evidence for Ukrainian strikes on Russian assets and positions in Kherson Oblast. Footage posted on September 12 shows smoke near the Antonivskyi Bridge in Kherson City following a Ukrainian strike, and residents reported the sound of explosions around Kherson City.[xviii] Ukrainian sources additionally reported that Ukrainian troops successfully destroyed two Russian pontoon bridges near Darivka (15km northeast of Kherson City) and Nova Kakhovka (55km east of Kherson City), thus temporarily rendering passage across the Inhulets and Dnipro Rivers impossible in these areas.[xix]\n\nNeither Russian nor Ukrainian sources discussed ground maneuvers along the Kherson-Mykolaiv frontline on September 12. Russian and Ukrainian sources discussed Russian indirect fire attacks on Ukrainian positions in northern and western Kherson Oblast, confirming that Ukrainian troops are holding recently recaptured positions near the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast border and near the Sukhyi Stavok pocket in western Kherson Oblast.[xx] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) continued to provide likely excessive figures for Ukrainian losses in Kherson Oblast but did not make any additional claims on September 12.[xxi] Russian sources are increasingly focused on providing commentary on Ukrainian advances in Kharkiv Oblast.\n\nRussian Main Effort- Eastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort- Donetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nThe Ukrainian recapture of Izyum has likely degraded Russian forces ability to conduct artillery strikes along the Izyum-Slovyansk highway. The Ukrainian General Staff noted that Russian forces did not conduct artillery strikes in the Slovyansk direction on September 12, likely referring to settlements northwest of Slovyansk on the E40 highway.[xxii] Russian forces continued routine fire on Slovyansk and the surrounding area to the east, southeast, and south.[xxiii]\n\nRussian forces continued ground attacks in Donetsk Oblast on September 12. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground assaults on various settlements around Bakhmut and Avdiivka.[xxiv] The continued ground attacks in this area far from the counteroffensive frontlines are noteworthy because Central Military District Commander Colonel General Alexander Lapin was given responsibility for the western grouping of forces that had been in Kharkiv Oblast following the loss of most of that oblast to Ukrainian forces. Lapin has shown no indication that he intends to alter his ongoing limited offensive campaign despite suddenly receiving responsibility for a collapsing front. He appears instead determined to continue attacks that have no meaningful chance of securing operationally significant, let alone decisive, gains. Russian forces continued routine fire along the line of contact in Donetsk Oblast.[xxv]\n\nRussian sources did not conduct any ground attacks in western Donetsk Oblast or eastern Zaporizhia Oblast and continued routine fire along the line of contact east of Hulyaipole.[xxvi] Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces are concentrating in the Vuhledar area and expressed concern that Ukrainian forces may launch ground attacks towards Vuhledar in the coming days.[xxvii] However, one Russian source claimed that Ukrainian forces in this area have since dispersed.[xxviii]\n\nSupporting Effort- Southern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nRussian forces did not conduct any ground attacks in Zaporizhia Oblast west of Hulyaipole and continued routine fire throughout Mykolaiv Oblast on September 12.[xxix] Russian forces also continued routine shelling in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast along the north bank of the Kakhovka Reservoir.[xxx]\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced the restoration of the second reserve power transmission line to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) on September 12.[xxxi] The IAEA stated that this power transmission line allows Energoatom to keep one power line in reserve while the remaining line provides the ZNPP with necessary electricity to sustain essential safety operations during and after the cold shutdown.[xxxii] The restoration of more power transmission lines to the ZNPP reestablishes safeguards that the Russian militarization and likely shelling of the ZNPP previously threatened or eliminated. Russian Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official Vladimir Rogov stated that ZNPP operations can restart after shelling ceases and the line of contact moves away from the plant, indicating that Russian officials likely hope to restart the plant and direct its energy production toward Russian grids in the future.[xxxiii] Russian officials have no formal authority to order the plant to start or to shut down and would likely have either to replace or coerce the Ukrainians operating the plant to restart it.\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nNothing significant to report.\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied areas; set conditions for potential annexation into the Russian Federation or some other future political arrangement of Moscows choosing)\n\nUkraines sweeping counteroffensive is damaging Russian administrative capabilities and driving Russian departures from occupied parts of Ukraine far behind the line of contact. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on September 12 that Russian forces throughout occupied Kherson Oblast have restricted general freedom of movement, strengthened military checkpoints, and increased looting, particularly of motorcyclesall apparent signs of Russian desperation.[xxxiv] Russian forces may be looting mopeds and motorcycles to flee in the event of a military collapse. The Russian-backed head of occupied Crimea, Sergey Aksenov, claimed on September 12 that Russian FSB officers detained Ukrainian \"terrorists\" who were planning an attack on the Kherson Occupation Administration.[xxxv] The Ukrainian Resistance Center also reported that Russian forces increased patrols and checkpoints around Mariupol on September 12 to thwart Ukrainian \"sabotage.\"[xxxvi]\n\nThe impacts of Ukrainian counteroffensives may reduce the likelihood that Russia will hold sham annexation referenda in occupied territories in the next month. The Center reported that \"a number of\" specialists remain in occupied Kherson, but that the Kremlin has put the referendum \"on pause.\" The Russian-appointed head of Zaporizhia Oblast, Evgeny Balitsky, claimed on September 12 that the Zaporizhia Occupation Administration would hold its annexation referendum \"as soon as we are ready in terms of security.\" Balitsky also claimed that 86% of Zaporizhia residents support Russian annexation of the oblastindicating either that occupation officials are conducting fake public opinion polls to support their planned referendum, or that they have pre-ordained the results of the pseudo-referendum.[xxxvii]\n\nThe Ukrainian Resistance Center reported that Ukrainian forces will use facial recognition and other intelligence to identify Russian officials and Ukrainian collaborators in newly liberated Ukrainian territories. Ukrainian forces arrested the occupation administration head of the village of Ivanivka, Kharkiv Oblast on September 9 and the collaborationist chief of occupation police for Balakliya, Kharkiv Oblast by September 11 and plan to prosecute both officials.[xxxviii]\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

See for yourselves where the Russian World rags are lying around. Glory to Ukraine, glory to the Ukrainian Armed Forces.\"\n\nMoscows almost total silence on the defeat or any explanation for what had taken place in northeastern Ukraine provoked significant anger among some pro-war commentators and Russian nationalists on social media. Some called on Sunday for President Vladimir Putin to make immediate changes to ensure ultimate victory in the war.\n\nCynical revenge\n\nZelenskyy said late on Sunday that Russian attacks caused a total blackout in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, and partial blackouts in the Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraines president, said Kharkivs CHPP-5 electricity station one of the largest in Ukraine had been hit.\n\n\"A coward response for the escape of its own army from the battlefield,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidents office, posted an image on Telegram of electrical infrastructure on fire but added power had been restored in some regions.\n\nUkraines gains are important politically for Zelenskyy as he seeks to keep Europe united behind Ukraine supplying weapons and money even as an energy crisis looms this winter following cuts in Russian gas supplies to European customers.\n\nSnowball rolling down a hill\n\nDefence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Ukraine needed to secure retaken territory against a possible Russian counterattack on stretched Ukrainian supply lines. He told the Financial Times that Ukrainian forces could be encircled by fresh Russian troops if they advanced too far.\n\nBut he said the offensive had gone far better than expected, describing it as a \"snowball rolling down a hill\".\n\n\"Its a sign that Russia can be defeated,\" he said.\n\nKyiv-based military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the gains could bring a further push into Luhansk region, whose capture Russia claimed at the beginning of July.\n\n\"If you look at the map, it is logical to assume that the offensive will develop in the direction of Svatove Starobelsk, and Sievierodonetsk Lysychansk,\" he said.\n\nLeonid Pasechnik, the head of the Luhansk Peoples Republic, was quoted by Russian news agencies saying Ukrainian forces were attempting to penetrate that region.\n\n\"Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups have not stopped their attempts to infiltrate the territory of the republic for the purpose of provocation and intimidating our citizens,\" he said, adding there had been \"no retreat from positions held by the republic.\"\n\nBritains defence ministry said on Sunday that fighting continued around Izium and the city of Kupiansk, the sole rail hub supplying Russias front line across northeastern Ukraine, which has been retaken by Ukraines forces.\n\nNuclear reactor shuts down\n\nAs the war entered its 200th day, Ukraine on Sunday shut down the last operating reactor at Europes biggest nuclear power plant to guard against a catastrophe as fighting rages nearby.\n\nRussia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant, risking a release of radiation.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency said a backup power line to the plant had been restored, providing the external electricity it needed to carry out the shutdown while defending against the risk of a meltdown.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told Putin in a phone call on Sunday the plants occupation by Russian troops is the reason why its security is compromised, the French presidency said.

By Monday morning, Reuters journalists in Kharkiv said the power was back on, although the water was not yet working. The regional governor said power had been restored by 80%. Moscow, which denies deliberately striking civilian targets, did not comment.

(credit: GLEB GARANICH/REUTERS)\n\nBritish intelligence update\n\nBritain's ministry of defense said Russia had probably ordered its forces to withdraw from all of Kharkiv region west of the Oskil River, abandoning the main supply route that had sustained Russia's operations in the east.\n\nKyiv, which reached the Oskil when it seized the railway hub city of Kupiansk on Saturday, suggested Russia was already falling even further back: the Ukrainian general staff said Russian troops had abandoned Svatove in Luhansk province, around 20 km (12 miles) east of the Oskil. Reuters could not confirm this. Advertisement\n\nThe British ministry said Moscow's forces were also struggling to bring reserves to the frontline in the south, where Ukraine has launched a big advance in Kherson province aiming to isolate thousands of Russian soldiers on the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\n\"The majority of the (Russian) force in Ukraine is highly likely being forced to prioritise emergency defensive actions,\" the British update said. \"The rapid Ukrainian successes have significant implications for Russia's overall operational design.\"\n\nUnraveling the Russian web\n\nUkraine's swiftest advance since driving Russian forces away from the capital in March has turned the tide in the six-month war, unraveling in a matter of days swathes of the gains Moscow had achieved in months of costly fighting in the east.\n\nUkrainian chief commander General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi said his troops had retaken more than 3,000 sq km (1,160 sq miles) this month, advancing to within 50 km (30 miles) of the border with Russia.\n\nFurther Russian retreats, especially east of the Oskil, could soon put Ukrainian forces in position to attack territory that Russia and its local proxies had held since 2014.\n\nDenis Pushilin, leader of the pro-Russian separatist proxy administration in Donetsk province, acknowledged pressure from multiple directions.\n\n\"At the very least, we have stopped the enemy at Lyman,\" he said in a post on Telegram overnight, referring to a frontline city east of Izium. \"We'll have to see how that develops. But our boys have had clear successes.\"\n\nHe also described \"successes\" in fighting at Bakhmut, where Russia had long been concentrating its offensive, and Vuhledar further south.\n\nMoscow has so far remained largely mute since its frontline collapsed in the northeast last week, with President Vladimir Putin and his senior officials withholding any comment on the \"special military operation\" they have always said was \"going to plan\".\n\nAfter days of making no reference at all to the retreat, Russia's ministry of defense acknowledged on Saturday that it had abandoned Izium and neighboring Balakliia, in what it called a pre-planned \"regrouping\" to fight in Donetsk.\n\nRussian broadcasters, required by law to report only official accounts, have alluded to the setbacks but struggled to explain them, with commentators mainly demanding a redoubled war effort.\n\n\"We must win the war in Ukraine! We must liquidate the Nazi regime!\" one commentator said on a panel show on NTV television.\n\n\"And how many years is that supposed to take?\" replied another. \"So my 10-year-old children will get a chance to fight?\"",

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\nWhen Ukrainian forces entered the city of Izium Saturday, it was more than a major military victory. It was a sign the war in Ukraine might be entering a new phase, one in which Russian troops are scrambling to hold onto the territory they captured over the past six months.\n\nRussian forces were forced to flee the strategic eastern city just five days after Ukrainian forces began a new offensive eastward through the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"Russians escaped and left weapons and ammo behind. City center is free,\" a spokesperson for the Bohun Brigade of the Land Forces of Ukraine said in a statement Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe last five days have seen the most ambitious ground assaults by the Ukrainians since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in late February. Video and satellite images geolocated by CNN show the advances have involved sustained attacks on command posts, ammunition stores, and fuel reserves far behind the front lines.\n\nA senior US official said Ukrainian forces had achieved some success in attacking Russian supply lines, with the intention of cutting off and isolating Russian troops west of the Dnipro River.\n\nSaturdays rapid advance did not end with Izium, as Ukraine appeared to have opened a new front against Russian defenses on the border of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\nThe head of the regional military administration for Luhansk, Serhiy Hayday, indicated the city of Lysychansk was the target of the new offensive.\n\nLysychansk was the last city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine to fall under Russian control in July, after weeks of intense fighting. Hayday told CNN on Saturday \"the occupiers, including both the collaborators and the military, are running away in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Locals have videos and photos proving that,\" Hayday said. He said the visual evidence could not be shared for security reasons. CNN was unable to verify Haydays claim, but at least one border crossing into Russia has seen lines of vehicles forming.\n\nOleksiy Reznikov, the Ukrainian defense minister, said Saturday Ukraines allies are \"amazed\" by the recent successes of the countrys military. Speaking at the end of a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Ramstein Air Base, Germany, Reznikov said Ukraines \"partners were positively amazed by the dynamics of our troops activities\" in the south and east of the country.\n\nRussian reinforcements\n\nAs Russian forces scramble to counter the Ukrainian advance in the east, Moscow is trying to reinforce its embattled military units there.\n\nVideo footage taken by a Russian military journalist Yevgeniy Poddubny Friday showed Russian helicopters arriving in the region and at least one unloading an armored vehicle.\n\nPoddubny reported Friday Russian military headquarters was using Mi-26 helicopters to reinforce units in Kharkiv with both men and armored vehicles, redeploying reserve troops to both Kupyansk and Izium.\n\nBut the reinforcements did not seem to have helped. In a big strategic win for Kyiv, both Izium and Kupyansk were recaptured.\n\nIzium, which sits near the border between the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, had been under Russian occupation for more than five months and had become an important hub for the invading military. Russia was using Izium as a launching pad for attacks southward into the Donetsk region and Kupyansk, some 30 miles to the north of Izium, as a rail hub to resupply its forces.\n\nSeveral videos of Ukrainian troops standing at the Izium sign at the entrance to the city were posted on Telegram. One piece of footage was purportedly filmed by a reconnaissance unit of Ukraines 25th Paratroopers Brigade. Over the video, a voice is heard saying: \"We are in Izium. Everything will be Ukraine. Our flag is here already.\"\n\nKyiv said its forces have also severed a major Russian supply line through the Kharkiv region and were moving further east. At the same time, the Ukrainian military said losses have been inflicted on Russian forces in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine.\n\nEven the Russian-backed authorities in Izium were forced to admit the retreat on Saturday. The head of the pro-Russian Izium city administration Vladislav Sokolov was quoted by the Russian state news agency RIA as saying the situation in Izium was \"very difficult.\"\n\nSokolov was later quoted by the Russian state news agency TASS as saying: \"We have begun the evacuation, albeit at a slow pace, but as far as possible, we are taking them to the territory of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nKirill Imashev, the military correspondent of a Russian Telegram channel, Readovka, said Russian forces had left Kupyansk and retreated across the river Oskil to \"regroup,\" but claimed residents of the city had \"left their homes in a hurry, fearing reprisals from the Kyiv regime.\"\n\n\"Hundreds of cars are leaving from Kupyansk to the LPR [the self-declared Luhansk Peoples Republic],\" he said.\n\nThe available evidence on social media networks shows the civilian population in the areas liberated have greeted Ukrainian forces with enthusiasm. Ukrainian officials have vowed anyone who collaborated with occupation forces will face criminal sanctions.\n\nUkraine said some Russian troops are now deserting due to the \"significant losses\" they have suffered. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said Friday at least 15 desertions had taken place. It said soldiers were abandoning their uniforms and wearing civilian clothes in an effort to blend in while attempting to return to Russian territory, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow was trying to paint a different picture of the Ukrainian advance.\n\nIn its first response to the gains made by Ukrainian forces in the last few days, the Russian Defense Ministry has said \"the decision was made to regroup Russian troops in the areas of Balakleya and Izyum and redirect their efforts in the Donetsk direction.\"\n\nThe advancing Ukrainian troops have reported scenes of destruction as they retake areas from Russian control.\n\nThe head of the Kharkiv region military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, said he had toured recently-liberated areas where the Russians had \"left broken infrastructure and houses, many trophies and piles of garbage,\" and posted photographs of the scenes on Telegram.\n\n\"People, without exaggeration, met our soldiers with tears in their eyes,\" Syniehubov said. \"Residents, of course, need help. Most villages do not have electricity or gas. In the near future, we will restore them and bring in humanitarian aid.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said negotiations with the Russian Federation surrounding the end of the war are currently \"impossible\" while he was at the annual Yalta European Strategy meeting in Kyiv on Saturday.\n\n\"Russians are not ready to admit they have occupied our country. This means there will be no substantial dialogue,\" Zelensky said. \"In order for us to open a diplomatic corridor with [Russia], they must show political will, that they are ready to give back foreign land.\"",

The Kharkiv city mayor says power is now restored.\n\nIt comes after Ukraine said it had retaken over 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) in an eastern counter-offensive.\n\nThe BBC cannot verify these figures.\n\nKharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure left much of his city without power or water on Sunday evening.\n\nHe called it a vile and cynical attempt at revenge for the Ukrainian army's recent successes.\n\nWhat sounded like two further missile strikes were heard later in the evening, the BBC's international correspondent Orla Guerin reported from Kharkiv.\n\nMr Terekhov and the region's governor called for calm, saying the emergency services were working to repair damage and put out fires.\n\nThe governor of the neighbouring Sumy region said over 130 settlements in one district alone were without power.\n\nSimilar problems have been reported in Dnipropetrovsk and Poltava regions.\n\nIn a defiant post on social media after the power cuts, President Zelensky accused Russia of carrying out \"terrorist acts\" by targeting civilian infrastructure.\n\n\"Cold, hunger, darkness and thirst are not as terrible and deadly for us as your 'friendship and brotherhood',\" he wrote on Telegram.\n\nIt comes after a remarkable Ukrainian advance, which if confirmed will mean Ukrainian forces have tripled their territorial gains in little over 48 hours.\n\nPresident Zelensky said 1,000 sq km had been retaken on Thursday evening. That figure rose to 2,000 sq km on Saturday evening, then to 3,000 on Sunday.\n\nUK defence officials estimated that Ukraine had recaptured territory at least twice the size of Greater London - more than 3,000 sq km - in the Kharkiv region since Wednesday.\n\nThey added that Ukrainian army's successes would have \"significant implications\" for Russia's overall operational design.\n\nJournalists have been denied access to the front lines but several videos on social media show Ukrainian troops present in towns and villages that were until recently held by Russia.\n\nUkrainian forces entered the key town of Balaklyia on Friday. Russia later confirmed the withdrawal of troops, to \"bolster efforts\" on the Donetsk front.\n\nThe vital Russian-held supply towns of Izyum and Kupiansk were taken by Ukraine on Saturday. Russia confirmed its forces' retreat from both towns, which it said would allow them to \"regroup\".\n\nValerii Marchenko, mayor of Izyum, said residents should be able to return to the town in about 10 days for the first time since it was captured by Russia in March.\n\nTwo-thirds of the population had fled, he told Newshour on the BBC World Service, but most wanted to go back despite extensive destruction and a lack of energy, water or communications.\n\nIzyum was probably the biggest logistical hub for the Russian army, he said, as it was a gateway to Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in the Donbas region, where Russia wanted to advance.\n\nBut Russia still holds around a fifth of the country, and few imagine a swift end to the war.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov warned of the potential for a Russian counter-attack.",

                "cc_text": "Ukrainian forces have attacked the Russian-occupied eastern town of Balakliia in the Kharkiv region, a senior Russian-appointed official has said. Daniil Bezsonov added that if the town were lost, Russian forces in Izium would become vulnerable on their north-west flank. The Luhansk regions governor, Serhiy Haidai, told Ukrainian television that a \"counterattack is under way and our forces are enjoying some success. Lets leave it at that.\"\n\nA Ukrainian counteroffensive is occurring in eastern and north-eastern Ukraine as well as in the south, a senior presidential adviser has claimed. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said that in the coming months Ukraine could expect the defeat of Russian troops in the Kherson region on the western bank of the Dnieper River and a significant Ukraine advance in the east.\n\nUkrainian forces are planning for a long and brutal campaign with the goal of taking back most of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson by the end of the year, according to reports. Ukraines goal of recapturing Kherson by the end of 2022 is ambitious but possible, US officials said.\n\nUkraine has claimed to have destroyed a key strategic bridge used by Russian forces in Kherson. Ukraines armed forces shared a series of satellite images purported to show the damaged structure on Tuesday night. The military said the images showed \"significant damage to the Daryiv bridge itself\" as well as damage to a building near the river.\n\nUkrainian troops could be in a position to seize the entire right bank of the Dnieper, including Kherson city, by October, according to a French general. Ukrainian forces have methodically prepared their counterattack in the southern Kherson region, launching offensives on \"almost the entire southern frontline\", Gen Dominique Trinquand, a former head of the French military mission to the UN, said.\n\nUkraines top military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has claimed responsibility for a series of strikes on Russian airbases in Crimea. The strikes used missiles or rockets and 10 warplanes were destroyed, he said. The attacks Zaluzhnyi took responsibility for reportedly included the devastating August strike on the Saki military facility.\n\nUkraines deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has urged residents of Russian-occupied areas around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to evacuate for their own safety. The town of Enerhodar, which serves the nuclear plant, has come under fire from Russian forces and lost electricity, according to its exiled Ukrainian mayor.\n\nUkraine is considering shutting down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant for safety reasons, according to Kyivs top nuclear safety expert. Oleh Korikov also expressed concerns about the reserves of diesel fuel used for backup generators. Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of threatening Europes nuclear security by shelling the plant, and claimed Russia has no military equipment at the facility.\n\nRussia has reportedly resumed shelling near the nuclear plant. A local official said the city of Nikopol on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Zaporizhzhia was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery. The report has not been independently verified.\n\nThe director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency has said the world is facing \"a very grave danger\" as shelling continues at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. In his first television interview since leading an expert mission to the Russian-held plant, Rafael Grossi said what was \"urgently needed\" was to establish a protection around the perimeter of the facility.\n\nThe UN nuclear watchdog has said its experts found extensive damage at the plant, in a report presented to the UN security council on Tuesday. The report said Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure where there was an increased possibility of human error. \"We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place,\" the IAEA chief warned.\n\nUkraines nuclear chief has said he would support the deployment of UN peacekeepers to Zaporizhzhia. The remarks by Petro Kotyn, the head of Ukraines nuclear agency Energoatom, came a day after the UN secretary general, Antnio Guterres, called for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear plant.\n\nThe head of the EU executive has set out plans for windfall taxes, mandatory electricity savings and a cap on the price of Russian gas to limit Kremlin revenues used to finance the \"atrocious\" war in Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic.\n\nVladimir Putin said western sanctions on Russia were shortsighted and a danger for the entire world, which he said was increasingly turning towards Asia. In a speech to the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, he also claimed the developing world had been \"cheated\" by a landmark grain deal designed to alleviate a food crisis.\n\nPutin also threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps were imposed on Russias oil and gas exports. Russia would walk away from its supply contracts if the west went ahead with its plans, Putin said, warning that Russia would \"sentence the wolfs tail to be frozen\".\n\nGermany is well placed to survive the winter despite turmoil in the energy markets, its chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said. Scholz vowed that Germany would keep moving \"at great speed\" to shed its reliance on Russia for power, adding that gas reserves were at over 86% capacity and would be used to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry.\n\nVladimir Putin will meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Uzbekistan next week, according to a Russian official. The pair plan to meet on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisations summit in the Uzbek city of Samarkand on 15-16 September, Russias ambassador to China, Andrei Denisov, said. It would the first face-to-face between the two leaders since Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February.\n\nBritains new prime minister, Liz Truss, and her US counterpart, Joe Biden, have promised to strengthen their relationship in the face of Putins aggression. Trusss call to Biden on Tuesday night followed a conversation with Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and focused on what she called \"extreme economic problems caused by Putins war\".\n\nPutin said the way Britain chooses its leaders is \"far from democratic\", a day after Liz Truss replaced Boris Johnson as prime minister. In his first public comments on Trusss appointment, the Russian president alluded to the fact she was chosen in a leadership ballot by members of the Conservative party, not by the whole country.\n\nLithuania, Latvia and Estonia have reached an agreement in principle to restrict the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus, the Latvian foreign minister said. Edgars Rinkvis said the increase of border crossings by Russian citizens was \"a public security issue [] also an issue of a moral and political nature\".\n\nThe leader of Russias governing party has proposed that a referendum should be held in occupied regions of Ukraine on 4 November on whether to become part of Russia. Andrei Turchak, the head of Vladimir Putins United Russia party, said it would be \"correct and symbolic\" to hold votes on that date, a Russian public holiday which is celebrated as the day of national unity.",

The United Nations International Childrens Emergency Fund (UNICEF) says they have lost track of that at least 26,000 children who, instead of being moved within Ukraines orphanage system, were reunited with their parents and legal guardians once Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The United Nations worry that the lack record-keeping and follow-up by Ukrainian officials can put orphaned children at risk of violence, exploitation and human trafficking. Ukraines National Social Service (NSS), tasked with overseeing childrens rights, said it had done \"everything possible to preserve the lives and health of children and prevent them from being left in the epicenter of hostilities.\" It said that support for families is provided by specialized social services, and that it was working to resolve problems,\" Reuters reports.

More from the story: Liberated Kharkiv Oblast residents from Zaliznychne told the Washington Post that Russians dropped their weapons on the ground when they fled, with some jumping onto stolen bicycles, trying to pass for locals. Vehicular losses were also great. Many pictures of Kharkiv Oblast showed abandoned Russian assets ranging from main battle tanks to engineering vehicles, self-propelled mortars and supply trucks. Analyst Jakub Janovsky estimated that Russia lost a total of 336 fighting vehicles in the country from Sept. 7-11.

I am Aben Clayton and will be taking over the blog for the next hour. The impact of recent counteroffensive operations seems to have swung the pendulum in favor of Ukrainian forces, though it remains unclear how much their gains will impact the ultimate trajectory of the more than six month conflict.

Overall we assess the Ukrainians are making progress as they fight to liberate and reclaim territory in the south and east. On the ground in the vicinity of Kharkiv we assess that Russian forces have largely ceded their gains to the Ukrainians and have withdrawn to the north and east. Many of these forces have moved over the border into Russia,\" the US military official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity, without offering a number. Well bring more details on this shortly. NEW: Russia's low troop morale, logistics issues, and the inability to sustain operations helped contribute to losses of occupied territory to Ukraine in Kharkiv region in recent days: senior U.S. military official Jack Detsch (@JackDetsch) September 12, 2022 Heres another voice. #Ukraine has presented #Russia|n forces w/\"multiple dilemmas\" per senior US military official\n\nRussia's ceding ground in #Kharkiv area \"indicative\" of morale & other issues, per the official Jeff Seldin (@jseldin) September 12, 2022\n\nUpdated at 16.02 EDT\n\n12 Sept 2022 15.32 EDT The Ukrainian authorities have said they are capturing so many prisoners of war among Russian soldiers retreating from occupation of the north-eastern region that the country is running out of space to put them, the Associated Press reports. As Ukrainian troops retook a wide swath of territory from Russia on Monday, pushing all the way back to the north-eastern border in some places, it was not yet clear if the Ukrainian blitz could signal a turning point in the war. Momentum has switched back and forth before, but rarely with such a big and sudden swing. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich did not specify the number of Russian prisoners but said the POWs would be exchanged for Ukrainian service members held by Moscow. Military intelligence spokesman Andrey Yusov said the captured troops included \"significant\" numbers of Russian officers. Ukraines deputy interior minister accused fleeing Russian forces of burning official documents and concealing bodies in an attempt to cover up rights violations in the areas they controlled until last week. Here is some footage with subtitles (and a warning of blurred images of bodies) tweeted by the UKs Sky News from its reporter in Zaliznychne, which the channel explains is a rural village that was occupied after the Russian invasion and until three days ago. Sky's Deborah Haynes was granted access to Zaliznychne, a rural village that three days earlier was occupied by the Russians.\n\nResidents there spoke of relief that they have gone - and gave rare testimony about what has been unfolding.\n\nMore here: https://t.co/X3flQUBL0r pic.twitter.com/XOy6EdtBQC Sky News (@SkyNews) September 12, 2022\n\nUpdated at 15.47 EDT\n\n12 Sept 2022 14.41 EDT Theres more detail from Ukraines advance to the Russian border, as reported by the Associated Press, quoting residents of the Kharkiv region. \"The Russians were here in the morning. Then at noon, they suddenly started shouting wildly and began to run away, charging off in tanks and armored vehicles,\" Dmytro Hrushchenko, a resident of Zaliznychne, a small town near the eastern front line, said. Oleh Syniehubov, the governor of Kharkiv region, said that \"in some areas of the front, our defenders reached the state border with the Russian Federation\". And a spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence said Russian troops were surrendering en masse as \"they understand the hopelessness of their situation\". Video taken by the Ukrainian military showed soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over battle-damaged buildings. In one scene, a fighter wiped his boots on a Russian flag on the ground. Other videos showed Ukrainians inspecting the wreckage of Russian military vehicles, including tanks. Efforts to disarm landmines were under way in the recaptured areas, along with a search for any remaining Russian troops, Ukrainian military officials said.\n\nUpdated at 14.56 EDT\n\n12 Sept 2022 14.00 EDT Summary It is 9pm in Ukraine. The military command of the Russian federation has stopped sending new units into Ukraine following a dramatic Ukrainian counter-offensive that has reshaped the war and left Moscow reeling, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said Monday. This information could not be corroborated. The Kremlin has yet to respond.\n\nMunicipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg have signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign. \"We, the municipal deputies of Russia, believe that the actions of President V. V. Putin harm the future of Russia and its citizens. We demand the resignation of Vladimir Putin from the post of President of the Russian Federation!\" read the statement published by Ksenia Torstrem, the municipal deputy of the Semenovsky district of St Petersburg.\n\nUkrainian forces have gained significant ground these past few days, particularly in the Kharkiv region . Today, it appears they continued to make great strides, reaching the border at one more location in the Kharkiv region: near the village of Ternova.\n\nMeanwhile, just today, Russia launched five missile strikes, more than 10 airstrikes and more than 20 attacks from rocket systems on military and civilian targets in Ukraine, the general staff of the countrys armed forces said. After knocking out the power and water supply once again to the Kharkiv region with earlier missile strikes, Russian forces continued its offensive on the city, this time directing its shelling toward the residential Nemyshlyansky district.\n\nAuthorities found the bodies of four tortured civilians in the recently recaptured Kharkiv town of Zaliznychne , the Ukrainian prosecutor generals office said. The discovery is an echo of the war crimes uncovered after Ukrainian troops retook Bucha and other areas around Kyiv.\n\nRussian soldiers engaged in mass looting as they fled Kharkiv oblast, the defence intelligence unit of Ukraines defence ministry said. Soldiers loaded \"generators, telephones and computers taken from Ukrainians into their cars. Rare cases of school robberies have been recorded, even horizontal bars and sports equipment were taken out of gyms\".",

They continue to use it indiscriminately against not just the Ukrainian armed forces but civilians and civilian infrastructure as we've seen,\" Mr Blinken said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.

Last Thursday, President Zelensky said Ukrainian forces had retaken 1,000 sq km, but by Sunday that stated figure had tripled to 3,000 sq km.\n\nMr Zelensky thanked several of Ukraine's brigades involved in the counter-offensive, describing their fighters as \"true heroes\".\n\nHe did not reveal which Ukrainian cities and villages had been liberated.\n\nReuters\n\nUkrainian troops pose with flags in a village retaken from Russian control in the north-eastern Kharkiv region\n\nRussia's military earlier admitted that its troops had to leave the key cities of Balakliya, Izyum and Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region.

The total area cited by Zelenskiy is roughly the size of the Greek island of Crete.\n\nSince Moscow abandoned its main bastion in the northeast on Saturday, marking its worst defeat since the early days of the war, Ukrainian troops have recaptured dozens of towns in a stunning shift in battleground momentum.\n\nIn Washington, the White House said the United States is likely to announce a new military aid package for Ukraine in \"coming days\". Russian forces have left defensive positions, particularly in and around Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, a U.S. spokesperson said.\n\nRussian forces still control about a fifth of Ukraine in the south and east, but Kyiv is now on the offensive in both areas.\n\nSpeaking in the central square of Balakliia, a crucial military supply hub taken by Ukrainian forces late last week, Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said 150,000 people had been liberated from Russian rule in the area.\n\nUkrainian flags had been raised and a large crowd gathered to receive bundles of humanitarian aid. A shopping centre had been destroyed but many buildings remained intact, with shops closed and boarded up.\n\n\"The aim is to liberate the Kharkiv region and beyond - all the territories occupied by the Russian Federation,\" Malyar said on the road to Balakliia, which lies 74 km (46 miles) southeast of Kharkiv.\n\nMeanwhile, repair crews have restored the two main power lines supplying Kharkiv city and its surrounds, power firm Ukrenergo said after Russian shelling caused blackouts.\n\nThe Kyiv government fears Russia will step up attacks on its energy networks as winter approaches and is pleading for anti-aircraft technology from the West to protect the infrastructure. read more\n\nWith Russian forces under pressure, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n[1/6]A Ukrainian service member stands on a Russian 2S19 Msta-S self-propelled howitzer captured during a counteroffensive operation, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kharkiv region, Ukraine, in this handout picture released September 12, 2022.

Is the writing on the wall for Putin?\n\nReading Time: 11 minutes\n\nQuite often, nothing really happens in wars where there are deadly stalemates for weeks on end. And then, everything happens all at once. This last week, everything has been happening all at once in the Russia-Ukraine War.\n\nTo understand what has taken place and how a lightning counteroffensive was planned and executed, we need to rewind to the beginning of the conflict.\n\nInitially, Putin had envisaged walking easily into Ukraine and deposing the sovereign government over a two- to three-day period, mopping up any minor protests over the proceeding fifteen days. This was confirmed by plans discovered in the following months, as well as in realizing how poorly prepared the Russian forces were for a lengthy conflict, with parade uniforms found in vehicles and rations lasting only five days.\n\nThe Russians were expecting to be met with an open embrace from Ukrainians. Instead, they were met with hostility and fierce military resistance.\n\nThe importance of SEAD\n\nThis brings into play the notion of SEADSuppression of Enemy Air Defenses. In 1940, the Germans fought the Battle of Britain as a precursor to invading the island nation. They knew that failing to achieve air supremacy would thwart an invasion. Without air supremacy, the enemy is allowed to inflict untold damage on ground forces and navies, incapacitating any offensive.\n\nThe Germans lost the Battle of Britain, and unable to attain air supremacy, gave up on the idea of invading.\n\nFast forward 80 years and many intervening conflicts in which SEAD operations were integral to any war, and it seems that Russia failed in their military history exam. Before any conflict is properly started on the ground, SEAD operations seek to take out enemy air defenses and air force capabilities. In the opening days of the conflict, Russia did try to take out Ukrainian air defenses and air bases, hitting runways and parked planes. But their efforts were simply not good enough. Ukraine managed to maintain a functional air force that meant the skies remained, at best for the Russians, contested.\n\nFor an excellent analysis of Russias failures here, see \"The Overlooked Reason Russias Invasion Is Floundering\" by Phillips Payson OBrien and Edward Stringer in The Atlantic.\n\n\"Russia has never fully appreciated the use of airpower beyond support to ground forces,\" David A. Deptula, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant general, told us. \"As a result, Russia, in all its wars, has never conceived of or run a strategic air campaign.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian skies have remained contested to this day, with Russia utterly failing to achieve anything close to air superiority, let alone air supremacy.\n\nThis alone has meant that the Russian forces have essentially relied on the Soviet tactic of rendering towns into \"moonscapes\" by bombing them with \"dumb\" munitions (bombs lacking guidance or other precision capabilities) before moving small numbers of troops into what is left of a given settlement. This is a devastating tactic, and an odd one if you are attempting to take control of an area to incorporate into your \"empire\" or nation. This short-sighted approach entails approach killing many civilians, destroying entire communities, and then spending huge amounts of money for years afterward building those towns back up, all while trying to win over the hearts and minds of those communities you have destroyed.\n\nBecause the Russians havent at any time achieved air superiority, and having exhausted their guided munitions, their jets and helicopters have had to operate far behind the frontlines, preferring to release longer-range rockets blindly at the Ukrainians from distance, with helicopters lifting their noses to increase the range, firing them high into the sky.\n\nThe genius of Kherson\n\nFor a good number of weeks before the beginning of this current counteroffensive that started in Kherson, the Ukrainians did a seemingly bizarre, potentially suicidal thing. They announced, over this protracted time period, that they were going to carry out a counteroffensive in Kherson. Counteroffensives are best achieved when those carrying them out have the advantage of surprise. Why would Ukraine want to announce such an attack?\n\nSo why Kherson? When Russia invaded Crimea back in 2014, they took the vital naval port of Sevastapol and a large amount of agricultural and industrial land. Crimea, however, depends upon the Kherson Oblast (region or state) for its fresh water. The Ukrainians cut off the fresh water to Crimea, and for some years, Crimea has been suffering from drought, water shortages, rationing, and water quality problems.\n\nAn approximation of the primary fresh water channel from Kherson and through Crimea. There are many secondary channels leading from it.\n\nWhen Russia invaded more recently, one of the first and only cities they took was Kherson. They needed that water. Moreover, Kherson was a necessary stepping stone to Mykolaiv and then Odesathe jewel in the crown. Odesa is not only of huge cultural importance but of great economic and logistical worth as well. Russia changed its initial objectives and recognized that taking the whole coastline would ruin Ukraines economy since the ports are vital for the export of almost all of their produce.\n\nMap from https://twitter.com/War_Mapper on Aug 24th. Here, the area to the north and west of the Dnipro River is occupied by reinforced Russian forces.\n\nFor some of the best mapping of the conflict, see the FTs latest maps also showing progress over time, as well as the Institute for the Study of Wars main map and their static maps from reports. See the larger map below to understand where Odesa sits on the coast.\n\nBut the Russians couldnt advance much past Kherson, and we have observed months of attritional stalemate from Kherson to Zaporizhzhia, and up to Donetsk and then Severodonetsk, taking a westward turn to Izyum and beyond.\n\nGiven this stalemate, it was odd to see Ukraine announce their forthcoming counteroffensive. As a result, Russia obliged, and collected somewhere around 30,000 troops and materiel from up and down their lines and reinforced the Kherson lines, where they were comfortably dug in, to the west of the Dnipro River.\n\nThis was genius.\n\nMap from https://twitter.com/War_Mapper as of Aug 24th, before the counteroffensives. Credit: War_Mapper\n\nDeadly presents\n\nOver the length of the conflict, Ukraine has received a vast amount of armaments, munitions, equipment, and vehicles from NATO countries and allies all over the world. The list is too long to detail, but the highlights are:\n\nLonger-range artillery than the Russians have.\n\nSPGsself-propelled howitzers that operate on tracks or wheels. This allows the guns to \"shoot and scoot\" (firing, and then getting out of the area quickly to avoid counter-battery fire). These include French Caesars, German PzH 2000s, and Polish AHS Krabs.\n\nHuge amounts of basic, but decent equipment, including quality body armor, helmets, and night vision goggles (that the Russians effectively lack).\n\nHuge numbers of APCs and IFVs (armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles), tanks and other specialist vehicles.\n\nSoviet-era and Russian fighter jets that they are used to flying.\n\nVast quantities of shoulder-mounted anti-tank launchers (Javelins, NLAWS, etc.) and MANPADs (man-portable air-defense systems that can hit helicopters and planes at 5km).\n\nGepards: German anti-aircraft autocannons with effective radar capability.\n\nAnd much, much more.\n\nBut the recognized game-changer has been the provision of multiple rocket launch systems, most notably the HIMARs (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems), which have a 50-mile/80-km range, and are also mobile (shoot and scoot). These have allowed Ukraine to pick off hundreds of high-value targets for over a month, destroying Russian logistics capabilities, and staving them of ammunition for their high-intensity artillery and rocket attacks.\n\nThe Ukrainians also built a whole host of wooden decoy HIMARs such that Russia boasted having destroyed far more HIMARs than Ukraine even owned! The reality is that Russia hadnt actually destroyed a single one.\n\nSimply put, HIMARs enabled the tide to be turned, and Joe Bidens US administration has been generously giving successive donations of materiel, including a steady supply of rocket launcher ammunition.\n\nThe honey trap\n\nThe protracted announcements gave Russia enough time to properly reinforce their defenses to the west of Kherson.\n\nAnd then it happened.\n\nThe first stroke of genius was the fact that Ukraine had attracted a mass of some of the best Russian troops to the region to the west of Kherson to add to those already there (including two airborne divisions and special forces units). But all of these troops had their backs to the Dnipro River. With the troops and all of their equipment in place, Ukraine hit the three road bridges (and railway) that crossed the Dnipro. eventually, they were destroyed. And when Russia tried to repair them, make pontoon bridges, and use ferries, these were all hit.\n\nSuddenly, Russia was utterly unable to resupply all of their troops and huge numbers of armaments with fuel and ammunition to the west of Kherson. Ukraine had sucked them in and cut them off. Advancing in three places, the Ukrainians made slow but meaningful progress. The Russians had nowhere to go, no way of being resupplied, and were being consistently hit by HIMARs and longer-range Ukrainian artillery.\n\nThe counteroffensive has cost both sides dearly, but the writing was on the wall. There is no way, short of magically receiving a bountiful supply of fresh reinforcements, that Russia is going to hold on to this Kherson territory.\n\nMap from https://twitter.com/War_Mapper on Sep 13th.\n\nThe second stroke of genius\n\nOf course, as you probably know by now, the Kherson counteroffensive was also acting as a feint. Secretly, Ukraine had amassed forces near their second city of Kharkiv. This was a city that was never taken by Russia but that has suffered daily and nightly rocket and artillery attacks, being in the northeast of Ukraine and near the Russian border.\n\nRussia had sent troops from up and down the frontlines in Ukraine to support the Kherson defensive. As a result, their lines were weak. Ukraines third piece of ingenuity was to attack where they knew the lines were weakest. In this case, to the east of Kharkiv, where their enemy were LNR and DNR troops or militia (also known as LPR and DPR, the Luhansk and Donetsk Peoples Republics). Luhansk and Donetsk are the regions to the east of Ukraine that were partially occupied in 2014, which had traditionally had more support for the Russians (in the east, marked in purple on the map below).\n\nMap from https://twitter.com/War_Mapper as of Sept 13th, with the white areas showing the territory that Ukraine have now liberated.\n\nHowever, the LNR and DNR forces were, at this point and in this area, to a significant degree made up of forced conscripts who are poorly trained and with low morale, fighting with outdated equipment. The region was also being defended by military police, who had no anti-tank weaponry and didnt know how to fire multiple grenade launchers.\n\nUkraine picked their spots perfectly. As such, they broke through the frontlines with ease. Real ease. In fact, comparatively speaking, Ukraine has hardly lost any troops or equipment in the entire Kharkiv counteroffensive. In a matter of days, Ukraine has liberated upwards of 6,000 square kilometers, more than Russia has achieved since April.\n\nThere were no tiered defenses, no secondary lines that the defenders could retreat to. Instead, they ran. First Balakliya fell after being encircled, and then the key logistical hubs of Izyum and Kupiansk. As the Russians fled, they left their equipment (and even half-eaten meals). By the hundreds. Open-source intelligence aggregators such as Oryx and Ukraine Weapons Tracker have been unable to keep up with the sheer volume of pieces of materiel that Russia has gifted to Ukraine or that has been damaged and destroyed. Stockpiles of ammunition have been left for Ukrainian use.\n\nMany POWs have been captured (though so many also escaped), including several higher-level commanders. Some troops even changed into civilian clothes and were caught escaping on bicycles.\n\nThis was a rout.\n\nAnd it is hard to over-estimate how damaging this will be for Russian morale going forward, and how encouraging this will be for the Ukrainians. Morale is known as a \"force multiplier\" in the theater of war, here giving the Ukrainians a greater advantage than they otherwise would have had. Ukrainians are now full of positivity, fighting for their freedom, for the homeland, for their families and future. On the other hand, the Russians dont even know what they are fighting for, other than Putins self-aggrandizement.\n\nA timelapse of the Ukrainian offensive in Kharkiv Oblast so far.\n\n(Approximate situation each day as of 00:00 UTC) pic.twitter.com/BB8kKOzBiH Ukraine War Map (@War_Mapper) September 13, 2022\n\nIn addition, Izyum and Kupiansk are vital rail and road logistics hubs for the Russians (who lean very heavily on railroads for their military). These Ukrainian gains damage the Russian ability to conduct effective warfare with sound supplies on the Donetsk front. The whole Russian campaign is a jigsaw, an interconnected puzzle that Ukraine has perhaps permanently ruined.\n\nThe Ukrainian forces are now taking a breather on the Oskil River, a natural defensive line for the Russians to fall back on. It will be interesting to see how the offensive develops since Ukraine, if they can reconstitute successfully and sort out their own logistics, will see the east of Oskil as ripe for picking. Indeed, several bridgeheads have been gained along the river, and north of the Siverskyi Donets River to which it joins. Severodenetsk and Lysychansk are under some pressure from Ukraine.\n\nCircling back to the beginning\n\nAnd this is where we circle back to what we were discussing earlier: SEAD. The Ukrainians have suggested that one of the heroes of this offensive was the Gepard. The radar of the Gepard has a range of 15 km and provides all-around scanning with simultaneous target tracking. These can work in unison to provide a network to alert forces of incoming aerial threats, and can use their autocannon to automatically target drones, helicopters, and jets. Even though they are not rockets, the autocannons are actually effective deterrents to jets, and it is known that Russian jets steered clear of the region, and were thus unable to support the troops on the ground.\n\nAs lightning-quick as the Kharkiv offensive has been, it is a culmination of months of steady attrition of Russian forces and capabilities. Without that attrition, involving the destruction of huge amounts of equipment, and perhaps 100,000 or more casualties (deaths and injuries), the Ukrainians wouldnt be in the strong position they now are.\n\nMoreover, with every passing week, the Ukrainian armed forces are being further upgraded, going from strength to strength, helped technologically and in terms of hardware, intelligence, and special forces, by their allies. With every passing week, the Russian army is being degraded. They have approached Iran and North Korea to procure weaponry. They are desperate, as the war takes its inexorable toll on their capabilities.\n\nThe latest that is rumored to be happening is negotiations between the forces in Kherson, with Russians apparently seeking to surrender on the right-hand bank of the Dnipro (the sides of a river are described in the direction they flow, so the right-hand side is on the left on the map!).\n\nPutins options\n\nAs the Ukrainian army improves, the Russian army deteriorates, and this trend only goes one way. I said this back in April: Putin cannot win.\n\nPutins options are few and far between. He can finally enact a national mobilization or unleash tactical nuclear warheads. Neither option is viable. Nukes would be suicidal and would probably lead to a coup. In a political and domestic context where the war is becoming less and less popular, mobilization would be political suicide and a tacit admission that they were losing.\n\nEven television pundits are starting to grumble. The following is a must-watch from several nights ago:\n\nLife comes at you fast: pundits on Russian TV realize that their military is failing and their country is in trouble. They are starting to play the blame game. Some of them finally understand that their genocidal denial of the Ukrainian identity isn't working in Russia's favor. pic.twitter.com/jNNn5xifI5 Julia Davis (@JuliaDavisNews) September 11, 2022\n\nAnd, staggeringly, more than 30 Russian municipal deputies have signed a petition calling for Russian President Vladimir Putins resignation.\n\nSo far, Russias desperate retaliation has been to hit energy infrastructure, taking out several power stations in an attempt to cripple Ukraine and dampen their spirit. It will take more than that to succeed.\n\nAnd now, since the counteroffensive, Russia has stopped sending new units into Ukraine to reinforce any area. It is troops and equipment that the Russian forces desperately need. The issue is possibly one of struggling to obtain volunteer recruits, leading the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to announce on Facebook yesterday: \"The current situation in the theatre of operations and distrust of the higher command forced a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse the prospect of service in combat conditions.\"\n\nTo make matters worse for Russia, while they are in such a precarious position, their neighbors are being opportunistic: there have been clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia concerning the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. It is unlikely, this time, that Russia will be able to send troops and equipment to sort the problem out.\n\nThis last week appears to have sealed Putins fate, short of any insane move he might make.\n\nThe writing is on the wall for the Russian forces: there is only one direction of travel. The momentum is entirely with Ukraine.\n\nBefore the war started, Russia were touted as the second greatest army in the world. They are now evidently the second greatest army in Ukraine.\n\n[For consistent updates on the conflict, check out Jonathan MS Pearces YouTube channel and Ukraine-Russia War playlist.]",

                "cc_text": "(CNN) The last week has seen a stunning transformation of the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, as a swift armored offensive by Ukrainian forces rolled through lines of Russian defenses and recaptured more than 3,000 square kilometers (more than 1,100 square miles) of territory.\n\nThat is more territory than Russian forces have captured in all their operations in Ukraine since April.\n\nAs much as the offensive was brilliantly conceived and executed, it also succeeded because of Russian inadequacies. Throughout swathes of the Kharkiv region, Russian units were poorly organized and equipped and many offered little resistance.\n\nTheir failures, and their disorderly retreat to the east, has made the goal of President Vladimir Putins special military operation to take all of Luhansk and Donetsk regions considerably harder to attain.\n\nOver the weekend, the Russian retreat continued from border areas that had been occupied since March. Villages within five kilometers of the border were raising the Ukrainian flag.\n\nLive updates: Russias war in Ukraine\n\nThe collapse of Russian defenses has ignited recriminations among influential Russian military bloggers and personalities in Russian state media.\n\nAs the Ukrainian flag was raised in one community after another over the last several days, one question came into focus: how does the Kremlin respond?\n\nA lightning operation\n\nUkrainian officials had telegraphed that an offensive was imminent but not where it actually happened. There was plenty of noise about a counter-attack in the south, and even US officials talked about Ukrainian operations to \"shape the battlefield\" in Kherson. Russian reinforcements perhaps as many as 10,000 streamed into the region over a period of weeks.\n\nThere was indeed a Ukrainian assault in Kherson, but one whose intention appears to have been to fix Russian forces, while the real effort came hundreds of miles to the north. It was a disinformation operation the Russians might have been proud of.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based analytical group, says the deception worked.\n\n\"Ukrainian military officials reported that (Russian) Eastern Military District elements that had previously supported offensive operations towards Sloviansk had redeployed to the Southern Axis,\" she told CNN.\n\nTheir replacements were clearly not up to the job a mixed bag, Stepanenko said, of \"Cossack volunteers, volunteer units, DNR/LNR militia units, and the Russian Rosgvardia (National Guard). Such forces were not sufficient to defend a vast and complex front line.\"\n\nThe Ukrainians picked the weakest spot in Russian defenses for their initial thrust an area controlled by the Luhansk militia with Russian National Guard units further back. They were no match for a highly mobile armored assault that quickly rendered artillery irrelevant.\n\nIgor Strelkov, formerly the head of the Donetsk Peoples Republic militia and now a caustic critic of Russian military shortcomings, noted the poor training of these units and \"the exceptional caution of the actions of Russian aviation.\" In short, Russian front-line units were hung out to dry without sufficient air support.\n\nMultiple videos geolocated and analyzed by CNN, as well as local accounts, depict a chaotic withdrawal of Russian units, with large amounts of ammunition and hardware left behind.\n\nThe poor quality of Russian defenses along a critical north-south axis sustaining the Donetsk offensive is hard to fathom. Once underway, the intent of the Ukrainian offensive was crystal clear to destroy that artery of resupply. Within three days, they had done so not least because Russian reinforcements were slow to be mobilized.\n\nRecriminations begin\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday sought to portray the abandonment of Kharkiv as a planned redirection of efforts to the Donetsk region but it actually complicates those efforts.\n\nUntil this week, the Russians were able to attack Ukrainian defenses in Donetsk from three directions: north, east and south. The northern axis is now gone: the threat to the industrial belt in and around Sloviansk has much diminished, as has the prospect of Ukrainian defenses being surrounded.\n\nSimply put, the battlefield in eastern Ukraine has been redrawn in days.\n\nThe most influential and perhaps surprising public critic of the situation was Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has supplied thousands of fighters to the offensive. In a Telegram post Sunday, he said he would be contacting senior officials at the Defense Ministry to spell out his message.\n\n\"Its clear that mistakes were made. I think they will draw a few conclusions,\" he said.\n\nHinting at disarray among commanders, Kadyrov said that \"if Russias General Staff did not want to leave, the (troops) wouldnt back out\" but Russian soldiers \"didnt have proper military training\" and that led to them to retreat.\n\nInfluential military bloggers in Russia have been even more blunt. Zakhar Prilepin, whose Telegram channel has more than 250,000 subscribers, reposted a commentary that described events in Kharkiv as a \"catastrophe\" and a wholesale failure of intelligence.\n\n\"Now we can observe the result of the criminal irresponsibility of those who were responsible for this direction,\" the post reads, before concluding: \"The special military operation is long over. There is a war going on.\"\n\nAnother pro-Putin blogger who goes by the name Kholmogorov reposted an equally scathing account by the Partizan Telegram channel from the front lines, which that essentially accused the Russian authorities of abandoning the troops.\n\n\"The soldiers were on foot with one machine gun and a sack. Abandoned by the command, not knowing the way, they walked at random,\" the post said.\n\nThe poster, who describes himself as a Russian Orthodox nationalist, says that while hatred of the enemy grows, \"hatred of the government and command is growing even more.\"\n\nAdding his own thoughts, Kholmogorov said: \"Lord, save the Russian soldiers from blows from the front and even more from blows in the back.\"\n\nA similar analysis came from the Telegram channel of Pyotr Lundstrem.\n\n\"There are NO thermal imagers, NO bulletproof vests, NO reconnaissance equipment, NO secure communications, NOT enough copters, NO first aid kits in the army.\"\n\nReferring to commemorations in Russia this weekend for the Day of Moscow, the citys birthday, he added: \"You are celebrating a billionth holiday. Whats wrong with you?\"\n\nOn Saturday, as the rout continued, Putin was inaugurating a ferris wheel in Moscow.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War notes the \"withdrawal announcement further alienated the Russian milblogger and Russian nationalist communities that support the Kremlins grandiose vision for capturing the entirety of Ukraine.\"\n\nPutins next move\n\nProminent media figures in Russia are trying to spin this weeks calamity as a planned operation. Television host Vladimir Soloviev reposted a Telegram commentary that insisted the \"enemy, buying into an easy advance on a given sector of the front, drives into a trap.\"\n\n\"Currently, Russian units are purposefully regrouping,\" the commentary added, even though there is little sign of that.\n\nThat begs the question as to how the Kremlin prosecutes the war after suffering its worst week of the entire campaign. It appears to be short of high-quality units. Some existing battalion tactical groups have been reconstituted; volunteer battalions have been raised across Russia to form a Third Army Corps. US officials say the Russians are running short of munitions, even turning to North Korea for supplies.\n\nStepanenko, at the Institute for the Study of War, told CNN that the remarkable success of the Ukrainian counteroffensive will force a reappraisal of how the new army corps is used.\n\nStepanenko, who studies the recruitment and organization of the Russian military, says the Russians \"might still attempt to use these units to stop the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kharkiv, although rushing ill-trained and unprepared raw units into such operations would be a highly dangerous endeavor.\"\n\nShe believes that given the Russian need for fresh manpower, \"it is likely that the Russian forces are deploying these elements directly onto the front lines in any case based on the reports that some volunteer battalions are already fighting on the Kherson front lines.\"\n\nThe Russian military can still bring considerable power to bear in terms of its rocket, artillery and missile forces. But despite one shuffle of the high command already, its ground operations seem poorly organized, with little autonomy devolved to commanders. The last week has laid bare issues of motivation and leadership.\n\nRussian bloggers who have supported the offensive say a radical rethink is required. One commented: \"A change of approach to the war in Ukraine is needed. Mobilization of the economy and industry. Creation of a political control center for war.\"\n\nStrelkov came to the same conclusion, saying it is time to \"start fighting for real (with martial law, the mobilization of the army and the economy.)\"\n\nThroughout the conflict, Putin has avoided a general mobilization, which might be unpopular at home.\n\nIts impossible to know whether the Kremlin will now double down in an effort to complete the special military operation or begins to look for a negotiated settlement.\n\nThe first option looks a tall order given the events of the last week; the second would be humiliating. The third possibility, perhaps the most likely, is that Russia will persist with its grinding inch-by-inch onslaught while taking little to no additional territory. But it now faces an adversary with the wind in its sails and fresh infusions of Western military aid being prepared for the winter months.\n\nUkraines battlefield advances have rejuvenated allied support, with a meeting in Germany this weekend producing further pledges of long-term support.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire & 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

                "cc_text": "Key Takeaways\n\nUkrainian forces continued to target Russian logistical nodes and key positions throughout Kherson Oblast in support of the ongoing counteroffensive in southern Ukraine.\n\nRussian milbloggers reiterated claims that Ukrainian forces are fighting along four axes of advance in Western Kherson Oblast.\n\nRussian forces conducted ground attacks northwest of Slovyansk, south and northeast of Bakhmut, and northwest and southwest of Donetsk City.\n\nRussian authorities escalated claims that Ukrainian forces are threatening both the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and the newly arrived International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) delegation on the territory of the ZNPP.\n\nThe Russian 3rd Army Corps is continuing to form for deployment to Donbas.\n\nRussian occupation authorities are likely increasingly recognizing their inability to successfully hold sham referenda in occupied areas of Ukraine due to Russian military failures and ongoing Ukrainian resistance in occupied territories.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin reiterated his false framing of Russias unprovoked invasion of Ukraine as a defensive operation to protect Russia on September 1. During a meeting with schoolchildren in Kaliningrad, Putin stated that the purpose of the \"special military operation\" is to eliminate the \"anti-Russian enclave\" that is forming in Ukraine and is an existential threat to the Russian state.[1] Putin similarly invoked the concept of an \"anti-Russia\" in his February 24 speech declaring a \"special operation\" in Ukraine.[2] Putins reiteration of an \"anti-Russian\" entity that must be defeated militarily to defend Russia reaffirms his maximalist intentions for Ukraine and is likely intended to set the information conditions to call for further Russian efforts and force generation going into the fall and winter of this year.\n\nRussian milbloggers continued attempts to claim that Ukraines counteroffensive in the south has already failed. Igor Girkin, a Russian nationalist and former commander of militants in the 2014 fighting in Donbas, stated that Ukrainian forces are continuing to attack after the \"failure of the first attack\"falsely portraying ongoing Ukrainian operations as separate attacks after an initial failureand reiterated the common Russian narrative that what he claims are Ukraines \"Western handlers\" pushed Ukraine to conduct a counteroffensive.[3] Girkin additionally stated that Ukraines Western partners poorly planned for the counteroffensive, underestimated Russian capabilities and assumed Russians are incompetent, and principally accounted for politicalnot militaryconsiderations.[4] One milblogger stated that Ukraines defeat in the south will be the strongest psychological blow to Kyiv and that this failure will have a continued long-term psychological effect on Ukraines morale.[5] The Russian milbloggers are increasingly centrally describing Ukrainian attacks as tactless and \"suicidal\" rushes.[6]\n\nMore on this topic ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, November 26, 2023 Latest from the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nAs ISW has reported, military operations on the scale of the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive do not succeed or fail in a day or a week.[7] Ukrainians and the West should not fall for Russian information operations portraying the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson Oblast as having failed almost instantly or that depict Ukraine as a helpless puppet of Western masters for launching it at this time.\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin has extended the deadline for Russian forces to capture Donetsk Oblast from August 31 to the still highly unlikely target date of September 15, and Russian forces are conducting several redeployments to meet this goal.[8] Deputy Chief of the Ukrainian Main Operational Department Oleksiy Gromov stated that Russian forces are regrouping elements of the Central Military District (CMD) operating in the Luhansk-Donetsk Oblast directions in an effort to increase the number of troops west of Donetsk City.[9] Gromov added that Russian forces deployed two battalion tactical groups (BTGs) in the direction of the western Zaporizhia Oblast frontline from Belgorod Oblast, which he noted might support resumed Russian offensive operations in Donbas.[10] Gromov stated that Russian military officials are continuing to form the 3rd Army Corps to deploy to Donetsk Oblast, also likely to resume offensive operations in the Donetsk operational area.[11] Gromov noted that it is unclear if all mobilized 3rd Army Corps servicemen have undergone military training.[12] Russian forces also reportedly introduced one BTG each to the Slovyansk and Mykolaiv directions.[13] RFE/RLs footage also shows that Russian forces are continuing to react to the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson Oblast by consistently transferring military convoys to southern Ukrainian via the Kerch Strait Bridge.[14] These Russian deployments are likely intended to set conditions for a revised operation to capture Donetsk Oblast, but Russian forces remain highly unlikely to make the progress necessary to capture the Oblast by September 15.\n\nThe Kremlin is likely seeking to capitalize on the significance of seizing areas around Donetsk City that have been contested since 2014 to boost the morale of Russian and proxy forces. Russian forces have not been successful in advancing toward Siversk or capturing the E40 highway to Slovyansk-Bakhmut since the fall of Lysychansk and are likely experiencing challenges incentivizing Luhansk Peoples Republic (LNR) elements to continue fighting to reach the Donetsk Oblast administrative borders.[15] Russian forces had minor territorial gains around Avdiivka, which generated positive chatter among the Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) fighters in early August after which the advances stalled west of Donetsk City.[16]\n\nAuthors: Kateryna Stepanenko, Karolina Hird, Layne Philipson, George Barros, and Mason Clark\n\nSee the full report here.",

Ukraine has pledged to regain control of Crimea Peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.\n\n\"The entire Donetsk region will be liberated,\" predicted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as his forces stood poised to take the strategic town of Izyum, suggesting Ukrainian forces will soon press their advantage east.\n\nBut US President Joe Biden warned against great expectations, saying the war would be \"a long haul\". Still, Ukraine may have turned a corner in procuring weapons it says it desperately needs.\n\nGerman daily Suddeutsche Zeitung said the US is now considering sending to Ukraine the Western main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles it has been crying out for.\n\nIn an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz did not rule out sending his countrys heaviest tank, the Leopard 2, to Ukraine saying, \"we will coordinate closely with our allies. The situation is dynamic.\"\n\nUkraines counteroffensive in the northern Kharkiv region began on September 6, even as another counteroffensive in the south begun a week earlier continued to unfold.\n\nOn September 8, Ukrainian forces took Balakliia, their first major prize, and came within 15km (9 miles) of the key logistics hub of Kupiansk. Lieutenant General Oleksiy Gromov said Ukraines counteroffensive had advanced to a depth of 50km (31 miles) behind enemy lines, reclaimed 700sq km (435sq miles) and secured 20 settlements.\n\nThe counteroffensive picked up speed the following day, liberating 30 settlements and 1,000sq km (621sq miles). Moscow-installed administrator for Kharkiv, Vitaly Ganchev, admitted that Kyiv had scored a \"substantial victory\".\n\nRussias defence ministry announced it was rushing reinforcements to the area, as it was caught off-guard by the Ukrainian push. It released video of a convoy of vehicles setting out from Raihorodka in Luhansk region south of Kharkiv.\n\nBut it was too little, too late.\n\nOn September 10, Ukrainian forces recaptured the western half of Kupiansk, which lies astride the Oskil river, and advanced south along the river to reach the outskirts of Izyum, which they recaptured the following day.\n\nAt its northern extreme, the counteroffensive marched to the Russian border, taking Vovchansk, north of Kharkiv city.\n\nUkraine recaptured 20 settlements on September 12, re-establishing control as far north as Ternova on the Russian border and as far east as Dvorchina on the west bank of the Oskil river.\n\nMoscow: Its all part of the plan\n\nAlthough the Kremlin admitted defeat on September 13, it originally claimed it was tactically retreating from the area west of the Oskil river, which now forms the new front line.\n\nSome observers told Al Jazeera the Russians did indeed plan a tactical retreat, aware of a coming counteroffensive. Yet there is more evidence pointing to a rout.\n\nSoldiers of the 1st Motor Rifle Regiment based in Izyum wrote en masse to their commander on August 30 asking for leave, suggesting they knew of the coming battle. Leave would have been unnecessary in a planned withdrawal.\n\nUkraine put Russian fatalities on September 6, the first day of its Kharkiv counteroffensive, at 460. On day two, it estimated Russian fatalities at 640, and 650 on day three.\n\nTo put these figures in context during summer, Ukraine estimated Russian fatalities at 150-200 soldiers a day. After August 24, as Ukraines counteroffensive in the south built up with artillery followed by a ground offensive on August 29, those estimates rose to 300-450 dead. The losses in Kharkiv may be the highest daily tolls of the war for Russia.\n\nThere was further evidence of a disorganised retreat. Ukraines general staff said Russian forces were stealing civilian vehicles to escape. It said about 150 soldiers \"departed Borscheva and Artemivka on two buses, one truck and 19 stolen cars,\" on September 11. Another Russian unit left Svatove in Luhansk oblast by stealing more than 20 cars from locals, the staff said.\n\nUkraines military intelligence intercepted phone calls of the 202nd motorised rifle regiment while in retreat from Kharkiv. Left without communications and commanders, they asked relatives in Russia to contact the defence ministry hotline in Moscow to ask for instructions or extraction. Half the regiment was captured.\n\nRussia said its tactical retreat meant to prioritise the fight for Donetsk region in the east, but Ukraines advance to the Oskil now exposes all that Russia has gained in Luhansk and Donetsk to an attack from the north.\n\nRussian forces doggedly continued their offensives to capture Bakhmut, a communications node in Donetsk, even as Kiyvs forces advanced to their north.\n\n\"Even the Russian seizure of Bakhmut would no longer support any larger effort to accomplish the original objectives of this phase of the campaign, since it would not be supported by an advance from Izyum in the north,\" said the Institute for the Study of War.\n\n\"The continued Russian offensive operations against Bakhmut and around Donetsk City have thus lost any real operational significance for Moscow.\"\n\nThe Kharkiv offensive may have triggered desertions behind the front lines. Ukraine says Russian servicemen fled Svatove, 40km (25 miles) east of the Oskil river, leaving only local Luhansk militiamen to defend it.\n\nIn the southern Kherson region, satellite images showed all except four vehicles absent at the Russian base in Kyselivka, suggesting that the Donetsk Peoples Republic unit that manned it may have fled. And reports surfaced that Russian troops were abandoning Melitopol in the heart of Russian-occupied Zaporizhia region, and retreating to Crimea.\n\nSuch desertions are encouraging partisans to mobilise. Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian partisans had retaken Kreminna, 12km (seven miles) behind enemy lines, and raised the flag there on September 11. Russian troops and collaborators were heading for the border, he said.\n\nUkraines southern counteroffensive also remained active during the Kharkiv operations. The Kakovka operational group reported 500sq km (193sq miles) of Russian-occupied territory have been reclaimed this month, and 13 settlements recaptured. Ukrainian forces have advanced between 4km (2.5 miles) and 12km (seven miles) in various places along the front. \"But the invaders still have a lot of strength and capacity,\" the group said.\n\nUkrainian victories have disrupted Russian recruitment, said Ukraines general staff. \"The current situation in the military theatre and distrust for top command has forced a large number of volunteers to abandon the prospect of combat service,\" the staff said.\n\nRussian politics still in Putins thrall\n\nWill there be political repercussions for Russian President Vladimir Putin?\n\nGoing by the results of the local and regional elections held on September 11, Putin still wields influence, as his supporters scored an overwhelming victory. But this is part of a waiting game by an opposition that sensed this was not its moment to strike, Russia observers have said.\n\n\"The number of candidates was the lowest for the last 10 years,\" said Stanislav Andreychuk, co-chairman of Golos, Russias largest independent election monitor. \"Very bright, very strong candidates didnt take part in elections because political parties didnt move them [towards elections]. Sometimes, they even cleaned them from their membership lists.\"\n\nOpposition parties have opted to keep their powder dry for now, said Andreychuk. \"The main political topic all over the country is war and sanctions. But you cant really talk about it in public, especially if you are against, because you can get seven or even 10 years in jail. So candidates tried to be very, very careful.\"\n\nYet avoiding the elephant in the room was such a conscious exercise, said Andreychuk, it may even have emphasised Putins current political fragility.\n\n\"Everybody understands that everything can be changed immediately,\" he said.",

                "cc_text": "In early August, the signs pointed south: Ukraine stepped up its tempo of long-range artillery and rocket attacks in the Kherson region, pounding Dnieper River crossings and Russian ammunition depots. Russia shifted sizable numbers of units southwest, away from the Donbas, in anticipation of what most observers expected was a major counteroffensive.\n\nLast week, the signs pointed east: Over roughly a six-day period, Ukrainian forces drove east and southeast away from the city of Kharkiv, plowing through what appears to have been undermanned and poorly defended Russian defenses, making a head-snapping counteroffensive to the Oskil River and rewriting the map of the Donbas battlefield.\n\nIn doing so, experts say, Ukraine may have rewritten the narrative of the entire invasion, nearly seven months since its launch.\n\nFor weeks now, across a roughly 2,400-kilometer front line from the mouth of the Dnieper River in the southwest to the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the northeast, Ukrainian and Russian forces have been pounding each other in what many experts called a stalemated war of attrition.\n\nOver the summer, as Western weaponry began arriving in larger quantities, things began to change. Over the past six days, however, everything changed.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n\"The Ukrainians now have the initiative in this war,\" said Mick Ryan, a retired major general in the Australian Army and fellow at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The Russians will now be fighting where the Ukrainians decide to attack them and not at places of their choosing.\"\n\n\"The loss of equipment and forces in Kharkiv means the Russians have no ability to wage any type of offensive in the short- to medium-term,\" said Konrad Muzyka, a defense analyst for Rochan Consulting.\n\nUkrainian troops on September 10 claimed control of the city of Izyum, a strategic railway hub in southeast Kharkiv that had been used by Russian forces to supply its forces as they pushed westward earlier in the summer. The city had been attacked just days after the February 24 invasion and besieged for weeks until late March, when Ukraine withdrew.\n\nWith Telegram, Twitter, and other social media channels awash in photos of Ukrainian flags hoisted in towns once occupied by Russian forces, Ukrainian officials claim to have wrested more territory from the Russian Army in the past week than all the territory Russia has captured since April.\n\n\"We're advancing not only south and east but also to the north,\" General Valery Zaluzhniy, the top commander of Ukraine's military, said in a post on Telegram on September 11. \"There are 50 kilometers to the [Russian] border.\"\n\nUkrainian troops have regained control of more than 3,000 square kilometers since the beginning of September, he said.\n\nLater in the day on September 11, unconfirmed reports said Ukrainian forces had advanced all the way to the border with Russia. Serhiy Hayday, governor of the Luhansk region, suggested that troops were also near Lysychansk, a key city on the Siverskiy Donets River whose loss in early July was seen as a substantial defeat for Kyiv.\n\nPunish The Commanders\n\nWhile Ukrainians are optimistic, if not jubilant, from Russia's perspective it's a split screen.\n\nOfficially, there has been no public acknowledgement of the Ukrainian successes or the Russian defeats. The Defense Ministry announced that its forces were being pulled out of Izyum and nearby Balaklia and were \"regrouping\" elsewhere.\n\nIn Moscow on September 10, Muscovites enjoyed fireworks and danced in the streets to celebrate the Russian capital's 875th birthday. President Vladimir Putin spent the day reviewing a new martial-arts facility in Moscow and marking the opening of a new Ferris wheel.\n\nUnofficially, there was dismay and fury, especially among the Russian military bloggers and more rabid nationalist commentators who let loose on Telegram channels, ripping into Russian commanders.\n\nIgor Girkin, a notorious former Russian intelligence officer who played an instrumental role when war first erupted in the Donbas in 2014 and who is now an outspoken critic of the Russian military, sarcastically noted a \"brilliantoperation to transfer the cities of Izyum, Balaklia, and Kupyansk to our respected Ukrainian partners.\"\n\nHe also acerbically suggested transferring several border districts in Russias Belgorod region to Ukraine.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov, the pugnacious Chechen strongman whose \"Kadyrovtsy\" fighters have played a visible role in several Ukrainian battles, said \"mistakes were made\" by Russian commanders and appeared to call the Ukrainian advances \"amazing.\"\n\n\"If today or tomorrow no changes are made to the conduct of the special military operation, I will be forced to contact the country's leadership in order to explain the situation on Earth to them,\" Kadyrov wrote in a mocking post on his Telegram channel. \"It is very interesting; 'amazing,' I would say.\"\n\n\"I'm no strategist, like at the Defense Ministry. But mistakes were made,\" he wrote in the post. \"I think they will draw conclusions from it. And when you tell the truth to a person's face, they might not like it. But I like to tell the truth.\"\n\n\"Its high time to punish the commanders who allowed these kinds of things to happen,\" another outspoken pro-Russian military blogger named Maksim Fomin said in a video posted on September 9.\n\nWATCH: 'Many Russian Soldiers Flee': How Ukrainian Forces Liberated 20 Towns\n\nBefore the war, military experts had discounted the ability of the Ukrainian military to withstand the onslaught of the bigger and better-equipped Russian Army. But Ukrainians thwarted an initial Russian effort from the north, aimed at seizing the capital, Kyiv, prompting Russian commanders to shift forces east to the Donbas, where they made slow, grinding advances with a reported artillery advantage of 10-to-1, wearing down Ukrainian troops.\n\nThe thrust into Kharkiv, and the lightning speed with which both Ukrainians advanced and the Russians retreated, surprised even experienced watchers of how the war has unfolded.\n\nRyan called the Ukrainian advance \"well-planned\" and part of a two-pronged effort in Kherson and in Kharkiv.\n\n\"Kherson was not a feint,\" he said. \"It is a significant operation that has been well-planned and executed against very tough Russian resistance. The operations in the north and south [and whatever comes next] appear to be part of a well-sequenced Ukrainian operational design.\"\n\n\"I think what happened was the Ukrainians went in with about three or four mechanized brigades and obviously didn't know what the expectation was,\" Muzyka told RFE/RL. \"At the bare minimum, to test the Russians defenses and see what would happen. And what actually happened was a total collapse of Russian defensive military positions.\"\n\nAnd while credit has been given to the tenacity of their soldiers, Ukrainians have also benefited from a firehose of powerful Western weaponry: U.S. long-range HIMARS artillery systems, M777 howitzers, high-speed anti-radiation missiles, French-made Caesar howitzers, and German-made Panzerhaubitze self-propelled artillery.\n\nThat has allowed the Ukrainians to fire, with pinpoint precision, at targets -- for example, bridges over the Dnieper River or command posts in the Kharkiv and Luhansk regions -- from distances harder for Russian artillery to reach.\n\nFor military planners and experts, the bigger question now is what happens next. Will the Ukrainians keep their momentum, even as the supply lines stretch out and are made vulnerable? Will the Russians be able to regroup and mount a counterattack or even withstand further Ukrainian advances?\n\n'They Can Do A Lot Of Damage To The Russians'\n\nOne of the biggest hindrances to Russias war-fighting ability has been personnel; its manpower problems have been well-documented for months now and officials have conducted a stealth mobilization campaign to replace killed and wounded personnel. U.S and Western officials say as many as 80,000 Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas have been killed or wounded since the start of the invasion.\n\nAny sort of recruitment campaign going on within Russia is likely to be severely diminished as news of the Ukrainians' Kharkiv successes trickles down, Muzyka said.\n\n\"The rout will have a negative impact on recruitment,\" he said. \"Russia does not have the manpower. The only thing they can do is force people to join, and the only way they can do that is through mobilization.\"\n\nPutin's reluctance to call for a general mobilization -- effectively declaring all-out war on Ukraine -- has flummoxed experts, who have concluded the Kremlin doesnt want to roil Russian society or undermine the passive support Russians have given the war.\n\nRussian commanders' decision to shift some of their most seasoned units away from Kharkiv, in anticipation of Kherson, further highlights that problem.\n\n\"It will depend on how fresh the Ukrainians are and what their level of logistics on wheels is,\" Ryan told RFE/RL. \"I would expect they have been told to go hard for, for a set period -- say, a week or two -- before they can expect relief. They can do a lot of damage to the Russians during this time.\n\n\"I think the Russian tempo at the moment is unable to keep up with Ukrainian operations,\" he said. \"Not only are the Ukrainians able to execute operations more quickly, they are doing so in a way, very geographically dispersed, which makes it hard for the Russians to reinforce between the north, east, and south.\"",

The drones were pressed into service after heavy losses depleted Moscows own fleet. [] At the start of the war, Russia had a formidable drone arsenal. Drones were a key part of the Russian Ground Forces \"reconnaissance-strike complex\" doctrine, which calls for drones to quickly find targets for artillery strikes. [] Six months of war has ground the arsenal down. [] The life of a drone is hazardous and short, with drones typically sent to places deemed too risky for humans. Theyre typically lost through air defence fire, small arms fire, operator error, and accidental crashes. Drones are often considered \"semi-attritable,\" meaning armies expect to lose them at a higher rate than crewed aircraft as the price of doing business. []\n\nThe Washington Post reports that, after several months of negotiations between Russian and Iranian officials, Russia agreed to replenish its ranks by buying a large consignment of homemade Iranian drones. It purchased Mohajer-6, Shahed-129 (pictured above), and Shahed-191 drones, the rough equivalent of Forpost-R and Orion MALE drones. Its a particularly ironic situation as Russia has for decades supplied Iran with advanced weaponry. []\n\nUnfortunately for Russia, Irans drones are apparently not without their problems. The Washington Post reports that several have malfunctioned in Ukraine, and that \"the Russians are not satisfied.\" Whether these problems can be fixed in time to be of use remains to be seen. Theres also the question of how long a non-stealthy drone flying at 10,000 feet can survive over Ukraine. Ukraines air defence network is largely intact, and it is evidently responsible for downing Russias homegrown MALE drones. Ukraines air defences are also set to become deadlier than ever, with the imminent deployment of NATO-supplied NASAMS and IRIS-T missile systems.\n\nRussias purchase of Iranian drones makes clear that even Moscow believes drones have become an indispensable asset in modern warfare. It also makes clear that Russias industrial capacity is not capable of replenishing losses. Finally, it tells us international sanctions are crippling its ability to buy good drones, to the point where it must settle for second-rate Iranian drones. In Ukraine, Russia is between a drone and a hard place, and it wont get easier for Moscow any time soon.\"\n\nrussia's combat losses in Ukraine as of September 11 52650 killed soldiers (+400)\n\n4617 APV (33)\n\n2154 tanks (+18)\n\n1263 artillery systems (+4)\n\n242 aircraft (+3) and 213 helicopters (+1)\n\n15 boats and cutters#StopRussia #StandWithUkraine pic.twitter.com/RpgiV1Bq68 VoxUkraine (@voxukraine) September 11, 2022\n\nHumanitarian\n\nThe US accuses Moscow of forcibly deporting up to 1.6 million Ukrainians, The New York Times reports. \"The United States on Wednesday accused Moscow of deporting up to 1.6 million Ukrainians to Russia or Russian-controlled territory and subjecting them to a \"filtration\" process involving invasive security screening, interrogation, family separation and detention.

She also mentioned the training program for the Ukrainian military which will be implemented together with the Netherlands. The range of training courses in the coming months will be expanded taking into account the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Lambrecht announced a new initiative: mine clearance measures.\n\nA course for long-term support of Ukraine set at Ramstein-5, Minister of Defence in Ukraine, Oleksii Reznikov reports. []NATO will organize NSPA training for specialists of the Defense Procurement Agency of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine. This is yet another bridge that de facto brings Ukraine closer to the Alliance. []\n\nUkraine has received hundreds of 105-m and 155-mm artillery units and ammo for them. Only for 155-mm ammo, we have 7 types of guns and self-propelled artillery. Ukrainian soldiers are bringing terror upon Russian forces with accurate and indivertible strikes of M142 Himars, M270 MLRS and MARS II. HARM missiles are already leaving Russian forces without radars. Harpoon missiles have joined forces with our \"Neptunes\". []\n\nShifts have begun in the area of air defence/anti-missile defence. We have already received the Gepard anti-aircraft self-propelled artillery units from Germany. Our specialists are completing their training on modern German Iris-T anti-aircraft systems that will soon make our skies safer. A policy decision was made regarding the NASAMS systems. And this is not to mention the armoured vehicles and a substantial amount of other help. All this happened in just 4.5 months.\n\nOnly 50 days passed between Ramstein-4 in July and Ramstein-5. [] The increase in the scale of aid as well as the successful actions of the Ukrainian defence forces that have been holding back the Russian invasion for almost 200 days have significantly affected the priorities. Firstly, along with the growing supply of weapons, there comes a question regarding their repair and maintenance. We are talking about spare parts, a repair base and necessary specialists.\n\nSecondly, the countries of the free world did not prepare for a full-scale war on the continent reminiscent of the Second World War. Due to this, the resources of operational assistance which can be provided by our partners at the expense of reserves are limited.\n\nThirdly and most importantly: thanks to the courage of our defenders and the resilience of the entire Ukrainian nation, it became clear that there is no need to \"deter\" or \"not provoke\" Russia. The Kremlins evil can be vanquished. All the branches of the defence forces of Ukraine under the command of General Valerii Zaluzhnyi proved in action the things which no one could believe before.\n\nAll this implies a correction in strategy. I drew the attention of all those present that the keywords this time were \"sustain\", \"long-term\", and \"training\". Moscow still has a lot of resources. Victory will not come instantly. But it will definitely come. That is why the task of organizing cooperation in the medium and long-term perspective comes to the fore. To give guidelines to our partners, in my speech I focused on the perspectives for the year 2023.\n\nOur goal remains unchanged. It is to restore the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine within internationally recognized borders. For this, in addition to a successful defence and stabilization of the front line, we need to carry out successful counterattacks. And then keep Russia within boundaries. To perform these tasks, the Ukrainian defence forces [] should acquire the appropriate capabilities in qualitative and quantitative terms.\n\nWe cannot talk about all the details right now. But among the most important priorities is the development of a three-tier air defence/anti-missile defence system. [].\n\nConsistent efforts are already being made to activate the work of the defence industry. This is needed to replenish the reserves in the countries of the free world and create opportunities to support Ukraine systematically. [] During Ramstein-5, several more steps forward were made in this regard. Given the need to fight back against Russia, the issue of investments in the military industry will soon be considered at a separate session within the framework of NATO. []\n\nIn the context of long-term support, the task of training Ukrainian soldiers has been raised to a qualitatively higher level. The range of our needs is wide: from acquiring individual skills to training as part of battalions, as well as training brigade headquarters. An effective training program initiated by Great Britain and supported by Canada, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and New Zealand is already in place. []\n\nJust imagine: 30,000 soldiers will be trained within this program alone. They will return to Ukraine completely ready for battle, with knowledge, gear, individual protection etc. This is the backbone of at least 6 brigades. And there are other programs too. Thanks to the leadership of Deputy Prime Minister, Polish Minister of National Defence Mariusz Baszczak the opportunity to train our soldiers on training grounds in Poland has been created.\n\nAt Ramstein-5, I asked to consider the possibility of deploying similar training programs in other neighbouring countries. The idea was immediately supported by a great friend of Ukraine, Slovak Minister of Defence Jaroslav Nad. This will ensure the scaling of the training process, and we will get more trained troops in a short period of time.\n\nIn parallel, a training program is being developed with the support of the EU. We have already made specific proposals, including the construction of training centres in Ukraine to combine European resources and technology with practical experience in our army. Then these centres will work in the interests of the whole of Europe. The activation of weapon production and training programs means strengthening the Ukrainian defence forces in the long run. No matter how many unmotivated and poorly armed criminal gangs Russia will bring; they will be engaged by Ukrainian troops that are trained and equipped with modern systems.\n\nWe will defeat Russia by qualitative advantages, by relying on the resources of the free world. [] It is a very difficult battle, it is waged on our land, and we bear painful losses. But the price of defeat is the destruction of Ukraine and the Ukrainian nation. And to the main point. During Ramstein, the partners clearly stated: we are here with you until the end of the war, that is until Ukraines victory. According to the data we are receiving, more and more Russians are beginning to believe that things around them are going in the wrong way.\"\n\nThe Lend-Lease model is yet to be established by Ukraines partners, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing RBC-Ukraine. \"As of early September, the final concept and details of Lend-Lease are still unknown. The specifics of what this aid programme will be like are still being discussed, says Oleksii Reznikov, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine. Im probably going to disappoint you by saying this, but the final understanding of what Lend-Lease will look like is yet to be formed because our partners have not yet finalised the model for the programme. The decision in principle has been made that there will be Lend-Lease, and Ukraine will be able to buy whatever it needs to win this war, and the budget has been determined. But the nuances and details of what this Lend-Lease will be like are still being discussed.\n\nWhatever I say now may turn out to be totally different in the final version. It is important to mention that the model will most likely be designed by ministers of finance, not ministers of defence, as these are financial relations. My goal is to consult with the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and understand their needs [when they] say they need these particular UAVs or missiles.\"\n\nNew Developments\n\nRussia is not ready for Ukraines negotiating position, Ukrinform reports. Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian Presidents Office, reiterated Ukraines negotiating positions. \"We formulate them as follows: please leave our entire territory, withdraw all troops [] to the borders internationally recognized in 1991, including the Crimean peninsula, destroy all your illegally constructed objects, including the so-called Kerch Bridge. After that, we will sit down at the negotiating table,\" Podoliak said. According to him, the Ukrainian side is ready to talk about three things: \"The first is reparations from the point of view of all the losses that Ukraine has suffered. The second is how we exist and coexist, since you [Russia] are neighbours, from the point of view of security for Ukraine. And the third thing is a certain legal responsibility that must be borne by a number of people, including those with Russian citizenship, who committed crimes in Ukraine,\" he said..\"\n\nForeign Minister Baerbock arrives in Kyiv She said her presence in Ukraine is intended to show \"that we'll continue to stand by Ukraine as long as it takes with delivery of weapons, humanitarian & financial support DWhttps://t.co/yk3bwEemfu Euromaidan Press (@EuromaidanPress) September 10, 2022\n\nBaerbock calls on Moscow to hand back control over ZNPP to Ukraine, Ukrinform \"German Federal Foreign Affairs Minister Annalena Baerbock has called on the Russian side to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission to stay at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) for a long time and hand back control over the plant to Ukraine as its sole legal owner.

Russian forces are not conducting a controlled withdrawal and are hurriedly fleeing southeastern Kharkiv Oblast to escape encirclement around Izium. Russian forces have previously weakened the northern Donbas axis by redeploying units from this area to Southern Ukraine, complicating efforts to slow the Ukrainian advance or at minimum deploy a covering force for the retreat. Ukrainian gains are not confined to the Izium area; Ukrainian forces reportedly captured Velikiy Burluk on September 10, which would place Ukrainian forces within 15 kilometers of the international border. Ukrainian forces have penetrated Russian lines to a depth of up to 70 kilometers in some places and captured over 3,000 square kilometers of territory in the past five days since September 6 more territory than Russian forces have captured in all their operations since April. Ukrainian forces will likely capture the city of Izium itself in the next 48 hours if they have not already done so. The liberation of Izium would be the most significant Ukrainian military achievement since winning the Battle of Kyiv in March. It would eliminate the Russian advance in northwest Donetsk Oblast along the E40 highway that the Russian military sought to use to outflank Ukrainian positions along the Sloviansk Kramatorsk line. A successful encirclement of Russian forces fleeing Izium would result in the destruction or capture of significant Russian forces and exacerbate Russian manpower and morale issues. Russian war correspondents and milbloggers have also reported facing challenges when evacuating from Izium, indicating Ukrainian forces are at least partially closing a cauldron in some areas. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced the withdrawal of troops from the Balakliya-Izium line on September 10, falsely framing the retreat as a \"regrouping\" of forces to support Russian efforts in the Donetsk Oblast direction mirroring the Kremlins false explanation for the Russian withdrawal after the Battle of Kyiv. The Russian MoD did not acknowledge Ukrainian successes around Kharkiv Oblast as the primary factor for the Russian retreat, and claimed that Russian military command has been carrying out a controlled withdrawal from the Balakliya-Izium area for the past three days. The Russian MoD falsely claimed that Russian forces undertook a number of demonstrative actions and used artillery and aviation to ensure the safety of withdrawing Russian forces. These Russian statements have no relation to the situation on the ground. The Russian MoDs inability to admit Russian failures in Kharkiv Oblast and effectively set information conditions is collapsing the Russian information space. Kremlin-sponsored TV propagandists offered a wide range of confusing explanations for Ukrainian successes ranging from justifications that Russian forces are fighting against the entire Western Bloc, to downplaying the importance of Russian ground lines of communication (GLOCS) in Kupiansk. The Kremlins propagandists appeared unusually disorganized in their narratives, with some confirming the liberation of certain towns and others refuting such reports. Guest experts also were unable to reaffirm the hosts narratives that Ukrainian successes are not significant for the Donbas axis. Such programming may reveal the true progress of the Russian \"special military operation\" to the general Russian public that relies on state media and the Russian MoD for updates. Russian occupation authorities of Vovchansk, Kharkiv Oblast, announce Russian retreat from the town Earlier today they claimed that Ukrainian troops moved towards Vovchansk through Khotomlia then captured Zarichne and Hontarivka and approached Vovchansk.https://t.co/Nkm0JfMBYc pic.twitter.com/e3E3KRUR4S Euromaidan Press (@EuromaidanPress) September 10, 2022 Eastern Ukraine : (Vovchansk-Kupiansk-Izium-Lyman Line). Ukrainian forces reached the northern outskirts of Izium on September 10 and will likely recapture the city within the next 48 hours if they have not already. Russian and Ukrainian sources reported that Ukrainian forces have not yet entered Izium and largely reported that Russian forces are withdrawing from the city. Russian sources reported that the Russian military deployed reinforcements to cover a withdrawal from Izium to the left bank of the Oskil River. Ukrainian forces northern advance has severed Russian forces most significant ground lines of communication (GLOCS) to Izium. Russian forces must now rely on suboptimal paths to the south and southeast that run through difficult terrain and over the Siverskyi Donets and Oskil rivers to withdraw forces. Ukrainian forces seized the western half of Kupiansk on September 10 and can likely take the rest of the city within 24 hours if they choose to cross the Oskil River. Russian sources reported that Russian forces retreated from western Kupiansk to the east bank of the Oskil River, where, a Russian source claimed, Russian forces can defend Kupiansks industrial zone more easily. A Russian source claimed that Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups are operating in the eastern half of Kupiansk. Geolocated footage shows Russian forces fleeing east from Kupiansks eastern outskirts, suggesting that most or all Russian forces in Kupiansk are withdrawing or have withdrawn to the east, most likely to Svatove, Luhansk Oblast. Ukrainian forces advanced to the southern and southwestern outskirts of Lyman on September 10, where Russian forces are covering the Izium groups withdrawal. Russian sources reported that Russian forces defended positions in Lyman against Ukrainian advances. Some Russian sources reported that Ukrainian forces established positions in small areas of Lymans environs, but that the Russian defence holds. Conflicting Russian reports that Russian forces withdrew from Lyman are likely false but attest to the panicked and confused state of the Russian information space about Russian forces situation in this area. Ukrainian forces advanced to positions within 1525km of the Russo-Ukrainian border in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast on September 10. Russian sources reported that Ukrainian forces captured Velyky Burlyk at the T2111 and T2114 intersection and Khotomlya on the east bank of the Pechenhy Reservoir. Russian sources stated that Ukrainian forces took advantage of the absence of a continuous Russian front line while advancing on Velyky Burluk. Ukrainian forces continued quick pace of advance is severing long-held Russian GLOCS that support operations in northern Luhansk Oblast, and their loss will severely hamper Russian and proxy operations. Russian forces likely no longer hold all of Luhansk Oblast as of September 10. Ukrainian forces likely captured Bilohorivka sometime between September 4 and 10. Russian sources reported that Russian forces withdrew from Bilohorivka sometime on September 410. Luhansk Oblast Administration Head Serhiy Haidai stated that Ukrainian forces reached the outskirts of Lysychansk on September 10. Southern Ukraine: (Kherson Oblast). Ukrainian military officials reported that Ukrainian forces are conducting positional battles in Kherson Oblast on September 10 but did not disclose specific areas of operation. Ukraines Southern Operational Command Spokesperson Nataliya Humenyuk stated that Ukrainian forces have advanced tens of kilometers in some unnamed areas of Kherson Oblast and noted that the Ukrainian counteroffensive is pushing Russian forces to retreat to their second lines of defenses. Humenyuk added that Russian forces continue to resist Ukrainian attacks and retain ammunition and supplies on the frontlines, but Russian units are suffering heavy losses. []Humenyuk and other Ukrainian military officials reiterated that Ukrainian forces are continuing their interdiction campaign by striking Russian ground lines of communication (GLOCS), ammunition depots and key positions to further weaken the reportedly 25,000- to 35,000-strong group of Russian troops on the Dnipro Rivers right bank. [] Social media footage of strikes, explosions, and activated Russian air defense systems indicates Ukraines interdiction campaign against Russian logistics in Kherson Oblast continued on September 10. Kherson City Telegram channels and media outlets reported a powerful explosion at a local military recruitment centre in Kherson City, which housed newly arrived Russian personnel and military staff. Ukrainian sources also reported explosions in Kherson Citys industrial zone and in the area of the Antonivsky Railway Bridge. Local reports also indicate that Russian forces are continuing to use barges to transport equipment to and from Kherson City. Ukrainian military officials also noted the arrival of additional Russian troops to central Kherson Oblast, which will reinforce occupied positions. Russian forces reportedly deployed an unspecified 1,300-person-strong Chechen unit to Kherson Oblast. It is possible that the Chechen units may be newly formed volunteer battalions or are at least in part staffed by new recruits. The Ukrainian General Staff and Ukrainian intelligence previously noted that new arrivals are older and inexperienced men, which fits the profile of Russian volunteer recruits. [] Ukrainian and Russian sources identified four areas of kinetic activity along the Kherson Oblast administrative border: west of Kherson City, near Snihurivka (about 60km east of Mykolaiv City), southeast of the Ukrainian bridgehead over the Inhulets River, and south of the Kherson-Dnipropetrovsk Oblast administrative border. Key Takeaways Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv Oblast are collapsing Russias northern Donbas axis, and Ukrainian forces will likely recapture Izium itself in the next 48 hours.\n\nand Ukrainian forces will likely recapture Izium itself in the next 48 hours. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced the withdrawal of troops from the Balakliya-Izium line on September 10, and the Russian MoDs failure to set effective information conditions is collapsing the Russian information space.\n\nThe withdrawal announcement and occupation authorities failure to organize evacuation measures is further alienating the Russian milblogger and Russian nationalist communities that support the Kremlins grandiose vision of capturing the entirety of Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian forces reached positions within 1525km of the Russo-Ukrainian border in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, Iziums northern outskirts, and Lymans south and southwestern outskirts, and captured the western half of Kupiansk.\n\nRussian forces are reinforcing frontline positions in Kherson Oblast while Ukrainian forces conduct positional battles and continue their interdiction campaign against Russian logistics lines.\n\nRussian forces conducted limited ground assaults north of Kharkiv City, south of Bakhmut, and west of Donetsk City.\n\nRussian recruitment drives are generating some criticism among Russian milbloggers and regions. Russian forces are reportedly intensifying filtration measures in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts in response to Ukrainian counteroffensives on the Southern Axis.\"\n\nMilley: Russian strategic objectives in Ukraine have been defeated, The Hill reports. \"Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Thursday said Russias strategic objectives in its attack on Ukraine have \"been defeated.\" The war is not over, but so far the Russian strategic objectives have been defeated, Milley said at a news conference alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nDespite being outgunned and outmanned, the Ukrainians have demonstrated superior tactical proficiency and theyve demonstrated a superior will to fight, fight for their own country, fight for their freedom, Milley added.\n\nRussia in April began an offensive in the easternmost part of Ukraine known as the Donbas after failing to take the capital of Kyiv early in the invasion. Milley, who allowed that Moscow has achieved \"minor tactical success in various parts of eastern Ukraine,\" attributed the falters in the Kremlins offensive to unsuccessful operational objectives and a very successful defense conducted by Ukraine. They have not achieved all of the Donbas, and they have only crossed the Dnipro River in the south in the vicinity of Kherson, he said of Russian forces.\"\n\nConsequences and what to do?\n\nThe US will host \"senior armaments directors\" from the member nations of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, Defense News reports. \"At the start of a Thursday meeting with senior officials from allied countries at the United States Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Austin announced that in the coming weeks, the US will host \"senior armaments directors\" from the member nations of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. They will discuss how our defense industrial bases can best equip Ukraines future forces with the capabilities that they need.\n\nMany countries continue to dig deep and provide equipment out of their own military stocks. That can mean purchasing new equipment from their own defense industries, or even purchasing new equipment from other countries that they can send to Ukraine, Austin told the meeting []. Austin said the countries working together should be able to \"streamline processes,\" shorten acquisition timelines and share best practices. The remarks come as Austin has launched an effort within the Pentagon to fast-track the foreign military sales process. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) generally allows recipients to purchase US-made defense equipment, and the State Department, which administers FMF, said Thursday that the aid is meant to help countries backfill weapons and equipment they have sent to Ukraine. []\n\nIn the immediate term, FMF will be used to cover wartime requirements of the AFU to provide them with the means necessary to win the war against the Russian Federation, a State Department spokesman said. Of the loans, $1 billion will be made available for Ukraine. The rest will be divided among 18 other countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. []\n\nAustin said the group gathered to renew its long-term commitment to military support. We will work together to help integrate Ukraines capabilities and bolster its joint operations for the long haul,\" Austin told the meeting. Well work together to upgrade our defence industrial bases to meet Ukraines requirements for the long haul. And well work together for production and innovation to meet Ukraines self-defence needs for the long haul.\"\n\nHeres what global weapons chiefs will discuss this month in Brussels, Defense News reports. \"A US-led meeting of armaments directors from around the world will take place in Brussels on Sept. 28, the Pentagons acquisitions chief said Friday. The meeting, coordinated with NATO, will be under the auspices of the 50-nation Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which is dedicated to arming Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russias invasion. The US invited the armaments directors of the member nations to the upcoming huddle, Bill LaPlante told reporters.\n\nIn looking beyond arming Ukraine for its current fight, the US is taking a lead role in establishing a longer-term weapons pipeline to allies and partners. [] In Brussels, officials will compare notes on how to ramp up production of key capabilities, as well as discuss the state of supply chains for microelectronics, solid rocket motors and other components, LaPlante said. They will also talk about ways to \"increase interoperability between our systems [and] what I would call increased interchangeability,\" he added. []\n\nJust as efforts to send billions of dollars worth of arms to Ukraine has forced conversations in the US about the strengths and weaknesses of the American defense-industrial base, top US officials are expanding that conversation to other partners in the fight and theyre hoping for candor. People are sort of in the same position we are, but I should remind everybody the scale of the United States defense enterprise is just something very different than what our partners and allies have, LaPlante said. I think thats one of the topic areas: to compare notes and see where people are. [].\n\nMeanwhile, the US is seeing demand in Europe for the kinds of weapons Ukraine is using against Russian forces, like the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System made by Lockheed Martin. Pentagon officials say that will likely fuel future requests for US arms transfers, possibly through the recently announced Foreign Military Financing package.\n\nI dont think we know yet exactly what each of these countries might be asking for, said Sasha Baker, the US deputy undersecretary of defense for policy This is sort of the starting gun for that process. But I think certainly theyre looking to learn lessons from what theyre seeing in Ukraine and then apply them for their own security.\"\n\nHans Petter Midttun: Social media is ripe with reports of Ukrainian advances and Russian collapse. There are claims of fighting in Izium, Lyman, Lysychansk and at Donetsk Airport, the seizure of Kupiansk and Velyky Burlyk, and Russian forces fleeing in disorder.\n\nAccording to the President of Ukraine, Ukraine has liberated more than 2,000 square kilometres since the offensive started on 6 September. ISW, however, assesses that Ukrainian forces have penetrated Russian lines to a depth of up to 70 kilometres in some places and captured over 3,000 square kilometres of territory more territory than Russian forces have captured in all their operations since April. In some areas, they are presently within 15 kilometres of the international border.\n\nThe number of Russians killed in action is staggering. The Ukrainian General Staff reports 52,650 dead. Other credible (but unconfirmed) sources indicate more than 77,000 when counting both regular forces, Russian PMCs and National Guard. A leaked letter from the Russian Finance Ministry says that as of 28. August, 361.4 billion rubles have been paid to the families of the deceased. According to the letter, the family of each fallen soldier received 7.4 million rubles. If the letter is authentic, this means that they acknowledge 48,759 confirmed dead. Since Russia is not counting its proxy forces (DNR, LNR, PMC, Chechens, Georgian and Syrian) the actual numbers are far higher. Russia is presently losing about 3,000 men each week.\n\nMark Hertling put the losses in proper perspective: This is the \"equivalent of 3 US combat divisions (think 82d Airborne, 101st Air Assault, 1st Armored). The US has 11 active divisions.\"\n\nWe have just witnessed one of the most spectacular military offensives in the 21st century. And it is not yet finished. In the next couple of days, we will know if the Russian forces managed to re-organise and reinforce the frontline to stop the advance and counter-attack, or if we are witnessing a broader collapse opening for further Ukrainian opportunities.\n\nWe will also know if the Ukrainian Armed Forces can sustain the offensive and protect the newly formed frontline. Going on the offensive will greatly increase both its consumption of ammunition as well as its casualties.\n\nEither way, the psychological impact of recent events in both Kherson and Kharkiv Oblast will have a huge impact on both sides of the frontline. For the Russian Armed Forces, already suffering from low morale and motivation, technical problems, bad logistics and leadership, and lack of air support, the last week will further weaken its resolve. For Ukrainian soldiers fighting a just war, September has brought success that will further lift their battle spirit.\n\nThat said, the offensive comes with costs. Russia has deployed around 300,000 soldiers (all categories) to Ukraine that effectively or not will continue to fight. My heart and mind, therefore, go to the very many Ukrainians that will pay the ultimate price as victory is inching closer.\n\nAdditionally, as we are rejoicing in the face of the amazing Ukrainian success, it is crucial to remind ourselves that a victory on the ground is not enough.\n\nTo ensure an economical viable Ukraine crucial for its future independence and sovereignty the maritime blockade needs to be broken and its cities need to be protected against Russian missiles and airstrikes. In essence, Russia must be defeated to a point where it no longer poses a threat to Ukraine and Europe.\n\nUkraine has nothing more to prove. Give them combat aircraft, ATACMS, modern battle tanks, and everything else they need to win this war quickly and decisively. Re-establish NATO presence in the Black Sea.\n\nEqually important, make Ukraine a NATO member. Ukraine would help strengthen the Alliance. It will help rebuild NATO deterrence and, therefore, deter further Russian transgressions. It would be a bold decision rendering the Russian nuclear \"fait accompli\" strategy useless.",

                "cc_text": "Over the weekend, Ukrainian troops drove Russian forces out of much of the countrys northeastern region of Kharkiv. The territory surrounding Ukraines second-largest city had been controlled by Russia since last winter, in the early days of the war.\n\nThe offensive boosted the morale of Ukrainians, who have endured more than six months of heavy conflict. Many are hopeful that this represents a turning point in the war. But some analysts caution that the conflict between the two countries isnt likely to end anytime soon.\n\nSergiy Kudelia, an associate professor of political science at Baylor University, hails from Ukraine and served as an advisor to the countrys deputy prime minister from 2008 through 2009. He joined Texas Standard to discuss the implications of Ukraines territorial gains.\n\nThis transcript has been edited lightly for clarity.\n\nTexas Standard: Can you tell us about the portion of the country that Ukrainian military forces have retaken recently?\n\nSergiy Kudelia: This is the northern region of Kharkiv Oblast, right on the border with the Russian Federation. The significance of this portion is that it is right next to the second-largest city in Ukraine, Kharkiv, which has been shelled by the Russian military since February. So, the fact that the Ukrainians pushed the Russians out of this area is a major change in terms of the ability of the civilians in this city to live a normal life.\n\nThe second important thing about this territory is that it is next to the Donbas region. Its next to Donetsk and Luhansk provinces. The takeover of the entire region of Donbas was one of the goals of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine. The fact that the Ukrainians managed to push the Russians out of the Kharkiv area makes it much harder for the Russians to capture the rest of Donetsk.\n\nWhat made this successful push by the Ukrainians possible?\n\nOne factor is the determination and the commitment of the Ukrainians. Another important factor is cooperation with western military officials, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom, who provided very valuable intelligence and advanced weaponry. Prior to the counteroffensive, Ukrainians spent about a week undergoing extensive artillery shelling of Russian positions. That put the Russians on the defensive.\n\nAnother factor is that the Ukrainian counteroffensive happened in two parts at the same time in the south and in the north. It required the Russians to concentrate their most capable military units on the southern part of Ukraine, because they value access to Crimea. That created an opening for the Ukrainian troops to move into the northern regions that were occupied by the Russians.\n\nHow has this offensive affected public opinion in Russia, and what consequences may it have for the future of the war?\n\nThe impact has been tremendous. Its clear even from the public discussions on Russian television. Before, there was a cheerful attitude about how quickly and how effectively the Russian troops could defeat the Ukrainians. There were no criticisms of Putin or military leadership.\n\nBut over the last several days on major Russian state television, weve seen statements coming out from different commentators questioning the strategy of the military command. Since these doubts are being communicated publicly to the Russian people, I wouldnt be surprised if we are also going to see a shift in the Russian public opinion that for quite some time supported the Russian invasion, believing that there would be a quick victory on the Russian side.\n\nNow, victory is far away from Russia. Theyre facing a humiliating defeat in this war. It is very likely that the Russians would actually prefer a complete withdrawal of the Russian troops and a quick end to this military invasion.",

Russians and their collaborators are fleeing from Luhansk region, heading towards Russia\". Luhansk makes up the Donbas region with Donetsk to the south.\n\nUkraines forces have continued to press their counterattack in Kharkiv, reportedly taking control of almost the entire province. Russia has launched dozens of air and missile strikes on power plants and other locations in apparent retaliation for Kyivs success.\n\nFearing retaliation, Ukrainian citizens who have cooperated with the Russians are \"packing their loot, packing their families, and leaving\", said Haidai, who backed up his claim by posting footage of cars queueing up at checkpoints in the towns of Stanytsia Luhanska and Shchastia.\n\nSerhii Smak, a 44-year-old from the recently-liberated town of Balakliia, said: \"There were many collaborators here. Some remained. But the majority have left and went to Russia\".\n\nAn indirect confirmation on the flight of collaborators came from Russian propagandists, one of whom wrote on Telegram: \"People who trusted us are fleeing the reprisals of the Kyiv regime. They trusted us and they have nowhere to go yet. They need tents, heating points, internet access points to contact their relatives, food and water, and just help and support.\"\n\nThe Guardian could not independently verify the claims.\n\nAccording to a man who fled east with his wife from Russian-occupied territory, there have been long lines of vehicles forming at border crossings into Russia. The man, who is not a collaborator, said he was fleeing alongside hundreds of others because they feared becoming caught in fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.\n\nIn Kharkiv city, police are attempting to arrest citizens accused of collaborating with the enemy.\n\nUkrainian prosecutors said at the beginning of May that there were more than 700 treason cases open against Ukrainian citizens, and a further 700 cases of collaboration. In Kharkiv province alone, prosecutors said they had opened 50 cases, including against seven police officers, five mayors, and a judge. They all stand accused of paving the way for Moscow to occupy villages and kill dozens of people during the Russian advance into the province.\n\nSome people who had fled to Kharkiv city from towns elsewhere in the province said that when the Russians arrived they carried lists of local people who were in the Ukrainian military, relatives of soldiers, and veterans of the 2014 war. According to testimonies of people in Kharkiv, the Russians allegedly kidnapped these people and took them to unknown locations, and they have not been heard from since.",

                "cc_text": "Wall Street closed higher on Monday, led by a rally in energy and tech stocks. The market closed its fourth winning day in a row as investors expected the upcoming CPI data to show that inflation has cooled off, even if slightly. Inroads made by the Ukrainian forces in the war against Russia also kept investor mood upbeat, but they remain apprehensive about further interest rate hikes from the September Fed meeting. All three major stock indexes ended in the green.\n\nHow Did The Benchmarks Perform?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.7% or 229.63 points, to close at 32,381.34. Twenty-seven components of the 30-stock index ended in the positive territory, while three ended in the negative.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite increased by 154.10 points or 1.3% to 12,266.41, led by a rally in tech stocks.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.1%, or 43.05 points, to end at 4,110.41. All 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the green. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) rose 1.8%, 1.6% and 1.3%, respectively.\n\nThe fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 4.7% to 23.87. A total of 9.6 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 10.2 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3.37-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.78-to-1 ratio favored the advancing issues.\n\nInvestors Eagerly Await CPI Report\n\nWall Street is keeping a close watch on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for August, which is slated to be released on Tuesday. Expectations are that after declining to 8.5% year over year in July from a 42-year high of 9.1% in June, inflation might settle in the region of 8% for the month of August. If it goes down even further, one may surmise that the Fed is seeing success with its monetary policy tightening and is considering easing off a bit. Core CPI, which excludes food and oil prices, has, however, continued its journey northward, increasing over the past couple of months, from 5.7% in June to 5.9% in July. If this number continues to rise, apprehension remains that the Fed would not be deterred from a 75 bp interest rate hike in its next meeting.\n\nStocks have rallied in recent sessions and market participants have been on a buying spree, rising above concerns over the economic outlook, expecting the inflation numbers to decline. This will also give them an idea about whether the Fed is likely to ease off in its policies going forward. Tech and energy stocks were the biggest gainers on Monday.\n\nConsequently, shares of APA Corporation APA and Fortinet, Inc. FTNT advanced 5% and 4.2%, respectively. Fortinet carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nUkraines Success Lifts Investor Mood\n\nReports came in on Sunday that Ukraine has retaken many villages and towns around Kharkiv, the nations second-largest city, and has put some Russian forces in retreat.\n\nEspecially, the fall of Izium in Kharkiv is being hailed as one of Moscow's worst defeats since its troops were forced back from the capital Kyiv in March. Ukraine is calling it a turning point in the war, as Russian forces used Izium as the logistics base for their Donbas campaign.\n\nInvestors see this as good news coming in from the war-torn country and markets reacted accordingly, keeping in mind that much of the volatility seen in recent months can be solely accredited to Russias campaign there. This is indeed one of the few stories of a successful counter-offensive launched by Ukraine in recent months, and makes investors ponder whether the tide is turning.\n\nEconomic Data\n\nNo economic data was released on Monday.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2021. Previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

It is five kilometers from the Russian border and has been extensively damaged during the conflict.\n\nSocial media video provided by the Derhachi city council also showed residents of another settlement Tokarivka raising the Ukrainian flag there. Tokarivka is also close to the Russian border.\n\nViktoriya Kolodochka, the head of the Tokarivka district, said Sunday: \"The village was de-occupied this morning.

They searched for people who had been in the security forces, confiscated phones and ransacked houses. She alleged they also beat and intimidated local residents.\n\n\"They took people to the basement of the school, beat them, electrocuted them, forced them to dig trenches, forced them to give information about people who worked in Ukrainian state bodies.

She said people mainly survived on their own garden produce. She said she had left the town in April, but her parents had stayed behind.\n\n\"There are people left [in Tokarivka] who are very, very much waiting for our military,\" she said. \"People really need help. There are ten paralyzed old ladies. There are people with diabetes and asthma. They survive as best they can. Medicines are very much needed.\"\n\nAs for those who had died during the occupation, Kolodochka told CNN: \"There are people buried in their yards we just buried them in their yards.\"\n\nShe added that there was still great uncertainty about what will happen. \"People are still scared. Will they stop shooting? Is it true that the Russians have left? Or not? They are waiting for Ukrainian military so much.\"\n\nBut she insisted: \"We will survive everything to be at home.\"",

[Photo Source: BBC News]\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has been to the recaptured city of Izyum, a key logistics hub in north-eastern Ukraine.\n\nDuring his visit, Mr Zelensky thanked troops who took part in the counter-attack against the Russian occupiers.\n\nHe oversaw a flag-raising ceremony and said the Ukrainian flag would return to every city and village in the country.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nUkrainian officials say they are targeting towns in the eastern Donbas region after making a series of gains in a rapid counter-offensive.\n\nIn recent days, Ukraines army has reclaimed swathes of occupied territory, forcing Russian troops to retreat.\n\nIn a late evening address on Tuesday, Mr Zelensky said his forces were fortifying their hold over 8,000 sq km (3,088 sq miles) of retaken territory in the Kharkiv region.\n\nLast Thursday, President Zelensky said Ukrainian forces had retaken 1,000 sq km. By Sunday, Ukraines figure had tripled to 3,000 sq km, before rising again to 6,000 sq km.\n\nThe precise scale of Ukraines gains has not been verified by the BBC.\n\nMr Zelensky vowed to take back all Ukrainian territory still occupied by Russian forces he said he did not know when this would happen, but that \"truth is on our side\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian military is deploying so-called barrier troops in Ukraine to prevent its own units from fleeing, according to Ukrainian military intelligence.\n\nUkrainian defence officials said that according to intercepted conversations, \"panic\" and \"refusals to fight\" are setting in among Russian troops.\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, officials accused Russian forces of targeting civilian infrastructure in the southern city of Kryvyi Rih on Wednesday.\n\nCruise missiles fired at the citys \"hydraulic structures\" caused water levels in a nearby river to rise and threatened local drinking supplies, Ukrainian authorities said.\n\nIn the US, President Biden said Ukraine had made \"significant\" gains.\n\nHe said it was \"clear\" that the advance had enjoyed success, but cautioned that the offensive \"could be a long haul\".\n\nWhile Russia still controls around a fifth of Ukraines territory, towns in the Donbas that fell early in the war are now the focus of Kyivs advancing forces.\n\nAfter failing to capture cities across the country, including the capital, Kyiv, Russia is focusing on the Donbas parts of which were already under the control of Russian-backed rebels before Russia launched its invasion this year.\n\nAndrey Marochko, military commander of the self-declared Luhansk Peoples Republic one of two regions that make up the Donbas told Russian state media that fighting had reached the borders of the territory.\n\nAnd Serhiy Hayday, the exiled Ukrainian head of the Luhansk region, said Ukrainian forces were engaging Russian troops on the outskirts of Lyman.\n\n\"There are fierce battles in Lyman now, which I think will last a few more days,\" Mr Hayday said in a Telegram post.\n\nLyman fell to Russian forces after a protracted battle at the end of May. It sits less than 150 km (93 miles) away from the city of Donetsk, the capital of the self-declared Donetsk Peoples Republic.\n\nIts capture was a coup for Russian troops, giving Moscow control over a key east-west highway.\n\nIn other areas, Ukrainian forces are said to have reached the Russian border, and Mr Hayday said their capture of two towns Izyum and Kupiansk could see supply lines to the Russian-held cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk severed.",

The military was able to regain control of the city of Izyum in the Kharkiv region, which is an important link in the operation to de-occupy Donbas. Dozens of settlements had been under Russian occupation for more than six months. What will the world see when these territories are liberated?\n\nThe first thing the world saw after the Russian army fled the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions in early April were the bodies of dead people in the middle of the streets. You probably remember pictures from Bucha and Irpin: a woman on a bicycle killed by a tank shot; families with children shot in cars while trying to leave the surrounded city; mass graves; volunteers and military personnel tortured by Russian soldiers. There was evidence of forced abductions, rapes, and looting. In just one month, the occupiers killed hundreds of people and mutilated the lives of tens of thousands who were \"in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n\nWhat is happening to residents of cities that have been under occupation for months? In the first months of the occupation in Izyum, according to eyewitness accounts, the Russian military shot up cars that \"inopportunely\" passed by tanks. Communal services did not work, so both bodies and blown-up cars remained outside for a long time. Locals said they saw fresh burials in the yards near children's playgrounds. We can only speculate about the causes of death: some died a natural death, some from shelling, and some at the hands of marauders who looted stores and warehouses.\n\nIn Kherson, one of the largest cities in southern Ukraine, as in many other places in the region, rallies against the Russian invasion occurred almost every day during the first month of the occupation. Hundreds of people took to the streets to protest, even though there were armed men and military vehicles in front of them. Over time, the protests subsided: Russian FSB officers began visiting activists' homes. Dozens of activists disappeared, and their fate is still unknown. Some were held for weeks in prisons and tortured to give up information about the underground resistance and the Ukrainian military. With the help of local collaborators, the Russian security services compiled lists of potential partisans and dissenters, checked them at checkpoints on the way out of the occupied cities, and conducted so-called \"filtration.\" Many men who ended up in \"filtration camps\" are still missing.\n\nCitizens who were able to evacuate from the occupation say that the Russian military checks the contents of the bags of everyone leaving, reads their cell phone correspondence, forces them to undress to check their tattoos, and conducts hours of interrogations. People have even begun to cover their patriotic, pro-Ukrainian or just controversial tattoos so that they won't have problems at checkpoints.\n\nIn major cities, the Russians have created military patrols: armed soldiers walk in groups in the streets and monitor how the locals behave. A person can be arrested for any criticism of these soldiers or patrols.\n\nResidents of occupied towns also say that looting is rampant there. Businesses and goods were taken from entrepreneurs and farmers who refused to cooperate with the occupiers. In the first days, says an athlete with disabilities who was evacuated from Kherson in August, Russians looted warehouses of food and household equipment. They took from farmers either part of their crops or everything they had and told them that they could only work in the fields if they cooperated with the new authorities on their terms.\n\nThe occupation has caused a major humanitarian crisis. Most of the citizens left in the Russian-occupied territories have no jobs and no money left to live on, and pensioners are unable to receive pensions because the state postal service cannot deliver. They procure food, clothing, and medicine at humanitarian aid points, which are delivered mostly from Russian territories. Many doctors have evacuated, and it is only possible to get emergency medical care (and even that is not guaranteed). Life in the cities where the Russian army has arrived can only be called survival, and the longer the occupation lasts, the harder it is to survive.\n\nIn Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk, the occupation regime was established back in 2014. The scale of the disaster was quite different then, but even then it was clear that the Russians had not seized these regions in order to \"protect the Russian-speaking population.\" Even then, the Russian authorities and their proxies kidnapped pro-Ukrainian activists (some ended up, like filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, in a Russian prison; some disappeared without a trace; some were killed) and staged show trials of Crimean Tatars who actively opposed the annexation of the peninsula. Now residents of these occupied territories are being forcibly drafted into the Russian army to fight against their fellow citizens.\n\nAll of this is the trace that the \"Russian world\" leaves behind. And the sooner the de-occupation of the territories taken by Russia takes place, the sooner Ukraine will be able to help people there and to rebuild what was destroyed.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those solely of the author and do not reflect the views of the Kennan Institute.",

                "cc_text": "Newsweeks William Arkin is a prisoner of his sources, a problem that pervades Western reporting on the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nBy Scott Ritter\n\nSpecial to Consortium News\n\nSix months into Russias \"Special Military Operation,\" fact-challenged reporting that constitutes Western medias approach to covering the conflict in Ukraine has become apparent to any discerning audience. Less understood is why anyone would sacrifice their integrity to participate in such a travesty. The story of William Arkin is a case in point.\n\nOn March 30 (a little more than a month into the war), Arkin penned an article which began with the following sentence: \"Russias armed forces are reaching a state of exhaustion, stalemated on the battlefield and unable to make additional gains, while Ukraine is slowly pushing them back, continuing to inflict destruction on the invaders.\"\n\nArkin went on to quote a \"high-level officer of the Defense Intelligence Agency,\" who spoke on condition of anonymity, who declared that \"The war in Ukraine is over.\"\n\nA little less than three months later, on June 14, Arkin wrote a piece for Newsweek with the headline: \" Russia Is Losing the Ukraine War . Dont Be Fooled by What Happened in Severodonetsk.\"\n\nApparently neither Arkin nor his editorial bosses at Newsweek felt any need to explain how Russia could be losing the war twice.\n\nAnyone who has been following what Ive been writing and saying since the beginning of Russias \"Special Military Operation\" in Ukraine knows I hold the exact opposite view. Russia, I maintain , is winning the Ukraine conflict, in decisive fashion.\n\nBut I dont write for Newsweek.\n\nWilliam Arkin does.\n\nArkin proclaims that Russia is losing though it had, at the time the article was published, just taken the strategic city of Severdonetsk, killing and capturing thousands of Ukrainian forces, and rendering thousands more combat ineffective since they had to abandon their equipment to flee for their lives. (Russia has since captured all of the territory encompassing the Lugansk Peoples Republic , including the city of Lysychansk, inflicting thousands of additional casualties on the Ukrainian military.)\n\n\"The Russian armys so-called victory,\" Arkin proclaimed at the time, \"is the latest installment in its humiliating military display and comes with a crushing human cost.\"\n\nThe humiliating display instead is Arkins lack of acumen in conducting an independent assessment of the military situation on the ground in Ukraine.\n\nThis was again reinforced last week when Arkin penned another article in which he helps disseminate the outlandish claims of his Pentagon sources.\n\n\"[F]rom late February through August, with only a moderate infusion of weapons from the West, some supportive declarations from Western leaders and a smattering of We Stand with Ukraine signs on U.S. lawns,\" Arkin writes, Ukraine has been able to \"hold at bay the mighty Russian military,\" something apparently none thought it could do.\n\nIgnore the jaw-dropping contention by Arkin that the tens of billions of dollars in military assistance provided by the U.S. and its NATO and European allies constitutes but \"a moderate infusion of weapons.\" No, dont ignore it focus on it. This is the signature style of Arkin and his Pentagon handlers, a sort of Orwellian double-speak where one can rest assured whatever bold statement is made, the truth is the exact opposite.\n\nArkin quotes \"U.S. intelligence officials who have been watching the war,\" writing that \"Russian troops have had to contend with bad battlefield leaders, inferior weapons and an unworkable supply chain.\"\n\nAnyone who has been tracking the events in Ukraine might have thought that this was the situation as it applies to the Ukrainian military. Not so, says Arkin and his source. Moreover, it is not Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky who has been interfering with his Ministry of Defense, but Russian President Vladimir Putin with his. These same Russian troops, Arkin declares, have \"also been hobbled by Putin himself,\" who has \"ignored, overruled and fired his own generals.\"\n\nThis is baseless fiction, written by a man who seems determined to cement himself in the annals of the Russian-Ukraine conflict as an unabashed Ukraine partisan and vehicle for Pentagon information warriors. Arkins narrative of the war to date is so far removed from the factual record it belongs in The Onion.\n\nWhat Arkin writes cannot even be called propaganda, because for propaganda to be effective it needs to be both believable at the moment of consumption, and able to sustain a narrative over time. Arkins work fulfills neither criterion.\n\nHis Sources\n\nLike most erstwhile journalists covering the conflict for western media outlets, Arkin appears to be a prisoner to his sources, which in this case are a combination of anonymous U.S. defense intelligence personnel and pro-Ukrainian propagandists.\n\nI used the term \"erstwhile\" in describing Western journalists because normal journalistic standards dictate that one seeks to report a story any story from a position of dispassionate neutrality, drawing on sources which reflect all sides of the story.\n\nThere is nothing wrong about drawing conclusions from such reporting, even assigning weight when it comes to which aspects of the coverage are deemed more credible than others. But before such conclusions can be made, foundational reporting needs to take place. Simply parroting what youre being told from sources exclusively drawn from one part of the story is stenography.\n\nIn the interests of full disclosure, Arkin and I were colleagues for a brief period in late 1998-early 1999, when we were both contracted to NBC News as \"on air talent\" to talk about the situation in Iraq. Arkin apparently did not hold my analysis in high regard then. I have no idea what he thinks today Consortium News has reached out for an answer, but as of publication has not received a reply.\n\nArkin did not respond to an invitation to debate me on Ukraine on a weekly podcast I do with Jeff Norman.\n\nIll let our respective track records speak for themselves, especially when it comes to Iraq and the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. Arkin says he is \"proud to say that I also was one of the few to report that there werent any WMD in Iraq and remember fondly presenting that conclusion to an incredulous NBC editorial board.\"\n\nIm pretty sure I was saying something similar to an equally incredulous Congress and to the entire mainstream U.S. media (NBC included), as well as the international press corps.\n\nCongratulations, Bill we once were on the same page.\n\nBut no more.\n\nArkins Achievements\n\nArkin is no run-of-the mill journalist. Hes a smart guy. He got accepted to New York University, although he dropped out to join the Army, claiming NYU \"wasnt for me.\" While stationed in Berlin, he completed his undergraduate studies, getting a bachelors degree in government and politics. After leaving the Army he got a masters degree in National Security Studies from Georgetown University.\n\nFor the next 40 years, Arkin worked for numerous employers, specializing in nuclear issues and military affairs, before landing his current gig as Newsweeks senior editor for intelligence.\n\nFor The Washington Post in 2010, after a two-year investigation, he wrote a ground-breaking story with Dana Priest about the vast and until then little-understood explosive growth of the national security state post 9/11.\n\nArkin then showed integrity when he resigned from MSNBC and NBC News in 2019. His reasons for leaving, spelled out here , include how he was \"especially disheartened to watch NBC and much of the rest of the news media somehow become a defender of Washington and the system.\"\n\nIn March this year he wrote a startling story that questioned the dominant Western reporting that Russia was committing repeated war crimes by wantonly slaughtering huge numbers of civilians just for the hell of it.\n\n\"As destructive as the Ukraine war is, Russia is causing less damage and killing fewer civilians than it could, U.S. intelligence experts say. Russias conduct in the brutal war tells a different story than the widely accepted view that Vladimir Putin is intent on demolishing Ukraine and inflicting maximum civilian damage,\" he wrote.\n\nThe article corroborated what Russia had been saying all along, which until that point was dismissed in the West as propaganda.\n\nSo how does Arkin transition from debunking Ukrainian and Western propaganda about Moscow deliberately killing huge numbers of civilians, to embracing the fanciful notion that Russia is losing the war? (Further underscoring Arkins assessment of Russias battlefield performance is the uninterrupted string of battlefield successes by Russia in the Donbass since that June article was published, further undermining his argument.)\n\nIts not a lack of education that has led Arkin down the path so many of his colleagues in mainstream media have stumbled down; there is no doubting the man is not only well educated, but also innately intelligent, something that doesnt necessarily follow the other.\n\nMilitary Expertise\n\nArkin can be said to be a victim of his own CV, which is light on relevant military experience for someone selling himself as an expert in military affairs based on his time in the U.S. Army.\n\nArkin purports to be one of the foremost military analysts of our times, a man whose track record in military affairs dates to his time as a junior enlisted soldier in the U.S. Army where, from 1974 to 1978, he served in occupied West Berlin as an intelligence analyst working for the Deputy Chief of Staff Intelligence (DCSI), U.S. Commander Berlin (USCOB).\n\nOn his WordPress page , Arkin writes that in the army he \"rose to be senior intelligence analyst for the Berlin military occupation authorities and served under civilian cover as part of a number of clandestine human and technical intelligence collection efforts.\"\n\nIn Berlin, Arkin adds in his LinkIn bio , \"I worked on a number of clandestine projects and was an analyst of Soviet and East German activities in East Germany.\"\n\nHe was not just any military analyst, mind you, but someone who, according to himself, \"was once one of the worlds leading experts on two military forces that dont even exist anymore.\" I worked closely with military officers who were in fact the foremost experts on both the Soviet and East German militaries during the time Arkin served. This Newsweek senior editor has engaged in more than a little self-promotion.\n\nThat someone of the rank of specialist or sergeant (I have no idea what rank Arkin achieved, but four years time in service is a self-limiting reality when it comes to advancement) being the \"senior intelligence analyst\" in all of Berlin on matters pertaining to the Soviet military is patently absurd; Berlin was home to numerous specialized intelligence units and organizations, any one of which would have been staffed with personnel far more senior and, as such, experienced, in intelligence analysis on the Soviet and East German target than Arkin. Simply put, Arkin was not, nor has he ever been, one of the worlds leading experts on the Soviet military.\n\nNot even close.\n\nArkin was never involved in combat arms , nor did he serve in combat. Without that experience he cannot understand the military realities of war logistics, communications, maneuvering, fire support, etc. Berlin was, from everything Ive heard, a fascinating place to serve but it wasnt combat.\n\nNot even close.\n\nAs Arkin has no combat experience, his military analysis is held hostage to his sources within the Defense Intelligence Agency who pass along such cutting-edge insights as the notion that Russia is suffering ten casualties for every Ukrainian soldier lost since the Donbass offensive began in April.\n\nArkin seemed unaware of documents alleged to have been leaked from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, dated April 21, which state that Ukraine had, as of the date, suffered 191,000 combined killed and wounded. According to Arkins math, this would mean Russia has suffered nearly 2 million casualties of its own.\n\nDespite the absurdity, Arkin keeps parroting what his Defense Intelligence Agency sources tell him.\n\nHe repeats, without hesitation, his intelligence sources assessment of Ukraines \"greater morale and motivation, better training and leadership, superior knowledge and use of the terrain, better maintained and more reliable equipment, and even greater accuracy.\"\n\nIt doesnt matter that literally every assertion made by Arkins intelligence source is demonstrably false. If Arkin knew about artillery (the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine is primarily an extended artillery duel), he would understand the concepts of probability of hit and probability of kill , and how the volume of artillery fired increases both.\n\nHe might then understand how absurd it is to think that an artillery duel where one side fires 6,000 rounds and the other 60,000 rounds could produce an outcome where the side firing 10 times fewer rounds achieves a 10-fold advantage in lethality.\n\nAny expert on Soviet/Russian military affairs would have known that artillery was going to be a major factor in any large-scale combat operation involving Russian forces. By way of example, three days before the Russian operation began, I tweeted (when I could still tweet):\n\n\"If you havent done a schedule of fires for at least three artillery battalions in the field using live rounds while maneuvering, Im probably not interested in your military opinion about Ukraine.\"\n\nArkin, to the best of my knowledge, has never done a schedule of fires for multiple battalions of artillery. His apparent lack of knowledge of artillery shows when he repeats verbatim the dreck fed him by his intelligence sources.\n\nArkins has to be aware that NBC News reported about the deliberate declassification and release by the U.S. intelligence community of intelligence information that intelligence officials knew was not true. And yet, Arkin still relies on these types of sources to provide the fodder for his headline-grabbing tales. The question of Arkins motives in writing such stories now remains.\n\nThat someone with Arkins background would allow a lifetime of diligent work to be squandered by serving as little more than a shill for U.S. intelligence is one thing. That media outlets like Newsweek keep printing it is another. Together, these twin phenomena represent what I call \"The Arkin Effect,\" which is nothing less than the total debasement of journalism in the U.S. when it comes to Russias war in Ukraine.\n\nSix months into Russias \"Special Military Operation\", most military analysts admit that Russia enjoys the upper hand on the battlefield, despite the billions of dollars in military aid that has been sent to Ukraine by the U.S. and its European allies.\n\nBut not Bill Arkin and his employers at Newsweek. They seem to be content with serving as the Defense Intelligence Agencys stenographers, putting out stories which have not, and will not, stand the test of time.\n\nScott Ritter is a former U.S. Marine Corps intelligence officer who served in the former Soviet Union implementing arms control treaties, in the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm and in Iraq overseeing the disarmament of WMD.
