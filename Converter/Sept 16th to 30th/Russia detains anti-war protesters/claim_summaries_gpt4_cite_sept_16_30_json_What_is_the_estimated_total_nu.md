This figure includes at least 502 people in Moscow and 524 in St. Petersburg <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. In a crackdown on anti-war protests, Russian police have been deployed in force to quickly arrest demonstrators rallying against conscription orders for the "special military operation" in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Some of the detained individuals included minors and a significant portion were women, making it the largest anti-government protest by share of women in recent history <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Despite the risk and harsh laws against criticizing the military and war in Russia, protesters have voiced their outrage against the mobilization, which has led to a significant number of arrests <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Notably, the response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of "partial mobilization" of citizens for his invasion of Ukraine has sparked rare protests across the country <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This has led to a heavy police presence and swift arrests in an attempt to quell the demonstrations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Rights groups report that there have been more than 16,000 detentions across the country for anti-war actions, although very few people now publicly oppose the war <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.
