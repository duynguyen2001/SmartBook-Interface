Pro-Russian authorities reportedly used intimidating tactics such as going door-to-door with armed guards and forcing people to vote, sometimes even recording votes themselves, all of which were strategies to manipulate the outcome of the referendum <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These manipulative practices, along with the capture of personal and biometric data of Ukrainian citizens at "filtration camps" and Russia's history of election fraud, contributed to a largely discredited referendum with no recognized international observers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Pro-Russian authorities utilized dubious methods to manipulate the referendum results in favor of Russia. Reports indicate they went door-to-door, accompanied by armed soldiers, to collect votes in occupied regions of Ukraine, which critics argue enforced a high turnout under duress <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Furthermore, they harvested personal and biometric data of Ukrainian citizens, potentially enabling ballot manipulation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The referendum process has been universally condemned as a "sham" by Western governments and Kyiv, with no international observer missions to ensure its legitimacy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Pro-Russian authorities used several strategies to collect votes for the referendum in Ukraine's occupied regions. They went door-to-door with portable ballot boxes to collect votes from residents, often accompanied by armed guards. Some instances even reported that residents were asked to answer verbally, and a soldier would then mark the response on the sheet of paper. These practices were reported in the occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south, and self-proclaimed, pro-Russian "republics" in Donetsk and Luhansk <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Additionally, authorities captured personal and biometric data of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens at so-called "filtration camps," which experts say could open the door to ballot manipulation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>These tactics significantly influenced the outcome of the referendum. Intimidation and coercion were common, with some residents reporting that they were voting literally at gunpoint. The lack of recognized international observer missions and reports of irregular voting practices, including ballot-stuffing and outright fraud, further cast doubt on the legitimacy of the referendum <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The referenda, hastily organized and widely condemned as illegitimate by Western governments and Kyiv, were seen as a thinly veiled attempt to provide a cover for illegal annexation of the regions by Moscow <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Electoral officials went door to door with portable ballot boxes to collect votes from residents living in the occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south, and self-proclaimed, pro-Russian "republics" in Donetsk and Luhansk, with polling stations open only yesterday, the last day of voting.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/russia-ukraine-war-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| Unsurprisingly, they show a resounding majority voted to join Russia. The referendums are widely seen as rigged, as many irregular voting practices have been reported. Electoral officials went door to door with portable ballot boxes to collect votes from residents living in the occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south, and self-proclaimed, pro-Russian "republics" in Donetsk and Luhansk, with polling stations open only yesterday, the last day of voting.

Nikolai Bulaev, the deputy chairman of Russias Central Election Commission, said he expects "hundreds of thousands" of Ukrainians currently in Russia to take part in the referendum. Russia has little history of holding free and fair elections, with ballot-stuffing, voter intimidation, outright fraud, and media manipulation common practices. It held a similar illegal vote in 2014 after annexing Ukraine's Crimea.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Russian state media yesterday claimed the military was involved for security reasons but critics say the tactics are being used to ensure a higher turnout as part of a cynical Kremlin propaganda campaign.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-mail" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Right" /></a><div><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-11246381/PETER-HITCHENS-questions-wisdom-stoking-Ukraine-conflict-despite-threat-nuclear-armageddon.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 24th, 2022</div></div>| Gun-toting Russian troops are going door to door in occupied areas of Ukraine to force people to vote in Vladimir Putins controversial referendums on whether they want to become part of Russia. As desperate Russian men try to avoid being drafted into the war in Ukraine including breaking their own arms security camera footage has shown heavily armed soldiers accompanying officials who are organising the referendum that Western leaders say is a sham. Russian state media yesterday claimed the military was involved for security reasons but critics say the tactics are being used to ensure a higher turnout as part of a cynical Kremlin propaganda campaign. A woman in the southern town of Enerhodar told the BBC: People are being asked to answer verbally and then a soldier marks the response on the sheet of paper.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Serhii Hayday, the Ukrainian head of the Luhansk region military administration, said that authorities were going door to door, trailed by armed guards, to collect votes.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/europe/ukraine-russia-referendum-explainer-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 27th, 2022</div></div>| What do we know about the voting? Reports from the places affected suggest that voting is being done essentially and in some cases, literally at gunpoint. Serhii Hayday, the Ukrainian head of the Luhansk region military administration, said that authorities were going door to door, trailed by armed guards, to collect votes. "If someone checked against joining Russia, the data is recorded in some notebooks," Hayday said on Telegram.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> The referenda only announced a week ago have involved officials going house-to-house collecting votes, sometimes accompanied by soldiers, as well as one day of voting at polling stations.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-27-22/h_a61e35f929debe0ed0a182ab129bc561" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 27th, 2022</div></div>| Remember: The referendum process has been widely condemned by Western governments and Kyiv as illegitimate and a "sham." There have been no recognized international observer missions. The referenda only announced a week ago have involved officials going house-to-house collecting votes, sometimes accompanied by soldiers, as well as one day of voting at polling stations. Ukrainian officials have reported the turn-out as minimal.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> They have been widely condemned in the west as illegitimate, and appear to be a thin attempt to provide cover for illegal annexation of the regions by Moscow.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/23/occupied-parts-of-ukraine-prepare-to-vote-on-joining-russia" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 23rd, 2022</div></div>| So-called "referendums" are under way in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian troops, with residents told to vote on proposals for the four Ukrainian regions to declare independence and then join Russia. The polls, hastily organised after being announced this week, are due to run until Tuesday. They have been widely condemned in the west as illegitimate, and appear to be a thin attempt to provide cover for illegal annexation of the regions by Moscow. Russian news agencies said voting in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces began on Friday morning.|

Self-styled referendums on joining Russia are continuing in four regions of Ukraine: Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine and the West have condemned the votes as undemocratic, and there have been numerous reports of locals being intimidated into voting by armed Russian soldiers. The votes would pave the way for Russia to annex the four regions.|

Russian President Vladimir Putin put a series of constitutional reforms before voters in 2020, including one that overturned Putins prior term limit in office. Accusations of fraud and intimidation followed the vote. The process could hardly have been more at odds with direct democracy and the autonomous expression of the peoples will.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> First, it runs sham referenda in areas controlled by its military and its proxies, coercing people to "vote" at gunpoint, then it uses these referenda to lend a semblance of legitimacy to its attempted annexations.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc15039.doc.htm" target="_blank">press.un.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Moreover, his emissary threatened to use nuclear weapons on a nonnuclear country to secure the illegitimate military gains of the Russian Federation. "The purpose of all of this is clear: Russia intends to try to annex these territories," she added. First, it runs sham referenda in areas controlled by its military and its proxies, coercing people to "vote" at gunpoint, then it uses these referenda to lend a semblance of legitimacy to its attempted annexations. "We know the outcomes of these sham referenda were pre-determined in Moscow," she continued, affirming that these actions do not represent a legitimate expression of the will of the Ukrainian people.|

"Given the short deadlines and the lack of technical equipment, it was decided not to hold electronic voting and use the traditional paper ballots," it said. Authorities will go door-to-door for the first four days to collect votes, and polling stations will open only on the final day for residents to cast their ballots. The Russian-installed leaders of the four areas abruptly announced the plans on Tuesday after a lightning Ukraine counteroffensive recaptured swathes of territory in northeastern Kharkiv that Russia had occupied after invading the country on February 24.|
