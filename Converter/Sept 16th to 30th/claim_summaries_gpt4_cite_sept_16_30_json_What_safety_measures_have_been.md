## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The Danish Maritime Authority has issued a navigation warning and set up a prohibited area to prevent vessels from entering the zones near the leakages, due to the risk of loss of buoyant force and potential ignition hazards above the water and in the air <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Additionally, Danish authorities have established a five-nautical-mile exclusion zone around the area and placed a small no-fly zone, although certain military aircraft remain active for monitoring purposes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The Danish Defense Ministry reported that three leakages have been detected along the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines. In response to these discoveries, the Danish Maritime Authority issued a navigation warning and established a prohibited area around the leakages to prevent vessels from entering the zones. This measure was taken due to the risk vessels could lose buoyancy and the potential for ignition hazards above the water and in the air <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The German Economy Minister, Robert Habeck, stated that German, Danish, and Scandinavian security authorities are currently investigating the cause of the leaks. In addition to keeping ships away from the area, a nautical safety zone has been set up around the location of the leaks to mitigate the risks of leaked gas igniting <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Further precautions were taken by Danish authorities who advised ships to avoid a five-nautical-mile exclusion zone set up around the leakages. A small no-fly zone was also established, although surveillance aircraft from the Royal Danish Air Force have been active in the area to monitor the situation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The Danish energy agency also noted that the shipping ban in the area around the leaks was necessary as the situation posed a danger to ship traffic <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Additionally, the Danish Seismic Network and the Swedish network picked up on the leaks and explosions, contributing to the monitoring efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

There are two leakages from Nord Stream 1 and one leakage from Nord Stream 2, the press office told CNN. The Danish Maritime Authority has issued a navigation warning and established a prohibited area to ensure that vessels do not enter the zones near the leakages. Vessels can lose buoyant force if they enter the area and there can be an ignition hazard above the water and in the air, the press office said.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Authorities are keeping ships away from the area, citing the risk of leaked gas igniting over the water and in the air but say there are few other security risks, since the leak will only affect the environment where the gas plumes are located.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/energy/nord-stream-pipelines-leaks-explainer-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| Other Western countries and NATO have echoed that conclusion. German, Danish and Scandinavian security authorities are now examining the leaks and trying to identify their cause, according to the German Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who added that Europe is able to protect its own critical infrastructure. Authorities are keeping ships away from the area, citing the risk of leaked gas igniting over the water and in the air but say there are few other security risks, since the leak will only affect the environment where the gas plumes are located. What is Nord Stream?|

If the leaks are not speedily repaired, its feared large volumes of salt water could flow into the pipelines and corrode them, the publication cited the sources as having said. A nautical safety zone has been set up around the location of the leaks What has been the international response so far?|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> In response to the incident, Danish authorities warned ships to avoid a five-nautical-mile exclusion zone around the area.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/sabotage-suspected-in-undersea-gas-pipeline-explosions-in-the-baltic" target="_blank">thedrive.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 27th, 2022</div></div>| The first reports of a "rapid gas pressure drop" on Nord Stream 2 came yesterday afternoon, from the pipeline operator, Nord Stream AG, of which the majority shareholder is Russias state-owned Gazprom giant. That leak is located southeast of the island of Bornholm, which has been a flashpoint of East-West tensions in the Baltic. In response to the incident, Danish authorities warned ships to avoid a five-nautical-mile exclusion zone around the area. A small no-fly zone was also established, although a Royal Danish Air Force F-16 fighter jet and an EH101 Merlin helicopter, at least, have been active in the area to monitor the leak.|

In 2019 the Russian government approved a National Adaptation Plan until 2022. It lists 30 measures, such as dam building or switching to more drought-resistant crops, as well as crisis preparations including emergency vaccinations or evacuations in case of a disaster. It says climate change poses risks to public health, endangers permafrost, and increases the likelihood of infections and natural disasters.|

German media, quoting unnamed security officials, say it's possible the leaks are a result of an act of sabotage, as it's extremely rare for undersea, concrete-coated steel pipes to break on their own. Authorities have halted all shipping in the area around the leaks. Lund says both the Swedish network and the Danish Seismic Network picked up the explosions on Monday.|

It is also possible to increase the protection of particularly vulnerable elements of the infrastructure, like oil and gas platforms or the shore stations for data and communications cables."|

And Russia had cut gas in Nord Stream 1 in August. But there was still natural gas inside hundreds of miles of pipes to maintain pressure inside of them. That's what's leaking, and it could take days to fully leak out.|
