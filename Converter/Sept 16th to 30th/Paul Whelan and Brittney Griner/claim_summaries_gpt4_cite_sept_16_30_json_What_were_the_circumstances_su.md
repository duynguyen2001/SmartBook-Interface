Brittney Griner, a two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist, was arrested in Russia in February for carrying vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner pleaded guilty to the drug charges, claiming she had accidentally packed the drugs while in a hurry <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Despite the small amount of hashish oil in her possession, which was not enough for trade or deal, and the evidence suggesting it was for personal use, Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison for drug trafficking, a verdict deemed ludicrous given the circumstances <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The Russian court also imposed a fine of around $16,400 on her <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The sentencing of Griner has attracted international attention and raised concerns about the treatment of detainees in Russia. US National Security Adviser, Sullivan, described discussions with the families of Griner and another US detainee, Whelan, as detailed and practical, concerning efforts to secure their release and raise the profile of their cases <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. President Joe Biden also expressed his empathy and reassured the families of his commitment to working through all available avenues to bring them home safely <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Griner's case has been compared to that of an Israeli backpacker, who was released after a few months despite being caught with a larger quantity of hashish oil at the same airport <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.
