EU states have almost completely shut down entry points from Russia by land and air, and for most Russians, it is nearly impossible to get visas. Even Finland, which initially accepted thousands of Russian arrivals, has announced it will close its borders. These travel restrictions fly directly in the face of Western interests, both in the war in Ukraine and in support for anti-Putin movements in Russia.|

Young Russian men who spoke to Reuters after crossing into Finland via the Vaalimaa border station last week, some three hours by car from Russia's second-largest city St Petersburg, said they left out of fear of being drafted for the war. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine "a special military operation". The Finnish government, wary of becoming a major transit nation, on Friday said it will stop all Russians from entering on tourist visas within the coming days, although exceptions may still apply on humanitarian grounds.|

The move sets the stage for the Kremlin to assert that it is defending, not attacking, in the war in Ukraine and so it is justified to use any military means necessary, a thinly veiled nuclear threat. Annexing the provinces could be used as a rationale for drafting Ukrainian men living there to fight other Ukrainians in the war, helping to solve a shortage of troops in the Russian Army. Why does the international community oppose it?|
