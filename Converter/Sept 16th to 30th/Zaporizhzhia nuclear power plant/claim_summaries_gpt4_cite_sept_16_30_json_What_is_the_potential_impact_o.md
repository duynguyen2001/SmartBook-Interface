# What is the potential impact on the European electricity market if the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, remains under Russian control?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
If the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, it could disrupt Ukraine's ability to export electricity to the European Union, which is already grappling with Russian gas undersupply and needs electricity to decrease gas consumption <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Moreover, Ukraine stands to lose 20% of its domestic electricity generating capacity, potentially necessitating reliance on other reserves or consumption restrictions during peak periods like winter <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, is a significant contributor to Ukraine's domestic electricity capacity, contributing 20% <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. If it remains under Russian control, Ukraine may have to resort to other reserves or potentially restrict consumption, particularly in winter <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This situation could also halt Ukraine's electricity exports to the European Union, exacerbating the existing energy crisis caused by Russia's gas undersupply <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the disruption of a power line used to supply electricity to Zaporizhzhia means it now lacks access to back-up power from the Ukrainian grid, which could potentially impact its operation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, is of significant strategic importance to both Ukraine and Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The station is an important part of Ukraine's economy, powers industrial production in the southern and eastern regions of the country, and in the event of its loss, Ukraine may have to use reserves or restrict consumption, especially in winter <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. If Russia continues to control the power plant, Ukraine would lose 20% of its domestic electricity generating capacity <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Moreover, the Russians could potentially use the plant to serve its own electricity market <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Should Russia maintain control over the Zaporizhzhia plant, there would be implications for the European electricity market. The absence of Ukrainian electricity could further burden the European Union, which is already struggling with Russian gas undersupply <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the Russian Deputy Prime Minister's assertion that the facility would provide energy to Russia and Ukraine, as long as Ukraine paid Russia for it, has been countered by Ukrenergo, Ukraine's electricity grid operator, stating that there is no technical possibility of connecting the nuclear plant to the Russian energy system instantaneously <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. This ongoing conflict and potential loss of a major power source could exacerbate the current energy crisis, prompting developed countries and major economies to extend the duration of nuclear power plants, reopen closed reactors, and approve new nuclear projects <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

But if Ukraines power system loses Zaporizhzhia NPP, Ukraine will have to use other reserves or maybe even restrict consumption in the winter. And clearly, there will be no export of electricity to the European Union, which is suffering from Russian gas undersupply and needs electricity to decrease gas consumption and withstand Russias energy blackmailing. The station itself is an important part of Ukraines economy and powers an important cluster of industrial production in the southern and eastern regions of the country.|

Zaporizhzia, located in southeastern Ukraine, is Europe's largest power plant, and has six reactors that are currently in a "cold shutdown state," the IAEA said. The plant still receives the electricity it needs for essential safety functions, but it now does not have access to back-up power from the Ukrainian grid, the IAEA experts said. The disconnected power line transferred electricity from the Ukrainian grid through the switchyard of a nearby thermal power station, the IAEA said.|

"Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) is once again receiving electricity directly from the national grid after engineers repaired one of the four main external power lines that have all been damaged during the conflict," International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed Saturday. Grossi said that the restored line is now "providing Europe's largest nuclear power plant with the electricity it needs for reactor cooling and other essential safety functions." "With the main line's re-connection yesterday afternoon, the three back-up power lines are again being held in reserve," according to the IAEA.|

The Ukraine electricity grid operator Ukrenergo, however, dismissed the Russian threats explaining that there is no technical possibility of connecting the nuclear plant to the Russian energy system "with a click of its fingers." Neither could it supply electricity to Crimea, said Olga Sukhopara, director of development of UARE.|

"It is imperative to send a clear message to other authoritarian leaders that open acts of aggression which violate international law shall not be tolerated by the global community of democratic States," he underscored. Noting that the Russian Federation has weaponized its natural resources to cause pain on European societies and destabilize democratically elected European Governments, he said: "We will support our citizens to cope with high energy prices. We will pool European resources to promote energy efficiency and rapidly diversify away from Russian oil and natural gas.|

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was captured by Russian forces in March. It remains close to the frontline, and has come under fire repeatedly in recent months, raising fears of a nuclear catastrophe. Both Ukraine and Russia blame each other for shelling the facility.|
