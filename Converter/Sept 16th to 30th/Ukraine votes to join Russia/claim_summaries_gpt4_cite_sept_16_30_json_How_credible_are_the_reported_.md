# How credible are the reported results of the referendums in favor of joining the Russian Federation?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The results of the referendums held in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, showing a majority voted to join Russia, are widely regarded as rigged and predetermined by the Kremlin, with reports of irregular voting practices including coercion and door-to-door ballot collection <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. These staged exercises, denounced as "sham" by the U.S. and its allies, are seen as part of Russia's history of cosplaying democracy, with the votes viewed as farcical facsimiles of democracy designed to obfuscate rather than convince <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The referendums held in four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, which saw a majority voting to join Russia, are widely regarded as rigged and not credible <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The voting practices were marked by irregularities, including officials collecting votes door-to-door and armed Russian troops pressuring residents to vote <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The U.S. and its allies have denounced the referendums as a "sham" and believe the outcomes were predetermined by the Kremlin <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The use of such tactics is reminiscent of Russia's past actions, such as the 2014 referendum on the annexation of Crimea and the staged elections in 1940 in the Baltic states, both of which were also seen as farcical imitations of democracy <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The referendums to join Russia, held in the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, namely Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk, have been reported as heavily skewed in favor of joining Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. These results, however, are widely considered to lack credibility due to reports of irregular voting practices, voter intimidation, and lack of independent observation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The voting process was rushed and conducted under the watchful eyes of armed Russian troops, with electoral officials reportedly going door to door to collect votes, a move that has been criticized as a tactic to manipulate the outcome <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>These referendums echo Russia's history of conducting questionable votes, most notably the 2014 annexation of Crimea where a reported 97% of voters favored joining Russia, a figure widely disputed by international observers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The U.S., European allies, and other global powers have denounced these referendums as sham and have pledged not to recognize the results, with Ukraine and western governments branding the votes as illegitimate and conducted under duress <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The voting process was not monitored by independent bodies, further casting doubt on the authenticity of the results <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The lack of transparency in Russia's voting system, characterized by common practices of ballot-stuffing, voter intimidation, and media manipulation, has further eroded the credibility of the referendums <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="1"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The referendums are widely seen as rigged, as many irregular voting practices have been reported.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/russia-ukraine-war-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| After a series of sham referendums in four Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, the results are out. Unsurprisingly, they show a resounding majority voted to join Russia. The referendums are widely seen as rigged, as many irregular voting practices have been reported. Electoral officials went door to door with portable ballot boxes to collect votes from residents living in the occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south, and self-proclaimed, pro-Russian "republics" in Donetsk and Luhansk, with polling stations open only yesterday, the last day of voting.|

The votes are expected to take place in the Russia-controlled regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, reportedly amounting to roughly 15% of Ukrainian territory. The outcome of the referendums is widely believed to have been predetermined by the Kremlin, prompting the U.S. and its allies to denounce them as a "sham." Political analysts say the Kremlin may then view Ukrainian military action against these four areas as an attack against Russia itself.|

This referendum is expected to serve as a pretext for their annexation by Moscow but has been rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies as a sham. The five-day period of voting, in which residents are asked whether they want their regions to become part of Russia, has been anything but free or fair. Tens of thousands of residents had already fled the regions amid the war, and images shared by those who remained showed armed Russian troops going door-to-door to pressure Ukrainians into voting.|

Moscow's proxies in the occupied regions claimed majorities of up to 99% in favour of joining. However, Ukraine and Western governments described those votes as bogus, illegitimate and conducted at gunpoint. MPs in the Duma, Russia's puppet parliament, are expected to rubber stamp the move next week.|

The outcome of the referendaa misnomer, given the coercive methods used to carry them outhardly came as a surprise. Russia has a long history of cosplaying democracy, from its 2014 referendum on the annexation of Crimea (in which 97% of voters purportedly voted to join the Russian Federation, though the actual result is thought to have been closer to 15%) to the staged elections in 1940 that paved the way for Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to join the Soviet Union that year. Then, as now, the votes represented farcical facsimiles of democracy that were designed to obfuscate rather than convince.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="6"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The referendums -- announced at short notice by pro-Russian authorities in the four regions -- were widely condemned by Western governments as a sham and against international law.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-28-22/h_8def30f207fe9997f5a09a7144e0afaf" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| As CNN previously reported, in Kherson, the Telegram channel of the pro-Russian administration said that with all votes counted, 87.05% were in favor of joining Russia. In Zaporizhzhia, the head of the election commission said the final tally was 93.11% in favor. The referendums -- announced at short notice by pro-Russian authorities in the four regions -- were widely condemned by Western governments as a sham and against international law. They were not observed by independent monitors.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="7"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Very few countries have accepted the results of the vote.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-elections-sham/32047316.html" target="_blank">rferl.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 23rd, 2022</div></div>| Russia has little history of holding free and fair elections, with ballot-stuffing, voter intimidation, outright fraud, and media manipulation common practices. It held a similar illegal vote in 2014 after annexing Ukraine's Crimea. Very few countries have accepted the results of the vote. There is no single database containing information about the number of polling stations that will open in Russia for Ukrainian citizens, nor uniform rules for how the voting will be conducted in the country, the daily Kommersant reported.|

RIA Novosti said with about 12% of votes counted, at least 97% of those cast have been in favor of joining the Russian Federation.|

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said that the commissions had published the results of referendums in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics. It did not say whether these were the final results. The referendum plans were suddenly announced a week ago by Russian-backed local administrations and immediately welcomed in Moscow.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="10"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Though plenty of disinformation circulated before both votes, the results probably fairly accurately reflected the peoples preferences.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/tampa-bay-times-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2022/09/22/direct-democracy-doesnt-always-deliver-what-you-might-think-column/" target="_blank">Tampa Bay Times</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 22nd, 2022</div></div>| But do these two high-profile instances illustrate fatal flaws in referendums, and direct democracy in general? Perhaps not. Though plenty of disinformation circulated before both votes, the results probably fairly accurately reflected the peoples preferences. Moreover, they illustrate the perils to political leaders of placing issues of crucial importance before voters they cant be sure they will like the results.|
