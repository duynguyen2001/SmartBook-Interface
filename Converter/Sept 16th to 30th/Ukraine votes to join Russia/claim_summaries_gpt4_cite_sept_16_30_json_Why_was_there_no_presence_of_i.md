## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The absence of independent observers during the referendums, which were condemned as "sham" and against international law by Western governments, resulted in the outcomes having no legal force and being perceived as illegitimate due to non-conformance with Ukraine law or international standards, and insecurity in the areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The process, involving officials collecting votes house-to-house sometimes with soldiers, and threats to break down doors if not opened, further undermined the legitimacy of the referendums, which were also denounced by Kyiv, Western leaders, and the United Nations as an illegitimate precursor to illegal annexation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The referendums in four occupied regions of Ukraine, where majorities reportedly voted in favor of joining the Russian Federation, were not observed by independent monitors <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. These referendums were announced at short notice by pro-Russian authorities and were widely condemned by Western governments and Kyiv as a "sham" and against international law <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which typically monitors elections, stated that the outcomes of these referendums would have no legal force because they did not conform with Ukraine law or international standards, and the areas were not secure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>The absence of independent observers significantly impacted the perceived legitimacy of the process. Many of the prewar population in these regions had fled, and in the remaining population, votes were reportedly collected through irregular practices like officials going house-to-house, sometimes with soldiers, and through one-day voting at polling stations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. In some instances, threats were used to coerce votes, further undermining the credibility of the process <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. These referendums have been widely condemned as illegitimate by the international community, including Ukraine, Western leaders, and the United Nations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Without independent observation and verification, the integrity of the voting process is severely compromised, making any outcomes questionable at best <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

As in the case of Crimea eight years ago, the vote was brought forward from a previously suggested date that of November 4. Regional referendums are banned in Ukraine. Like in Crimea, there will be no independent election monitoring.|

Unsurprisingly, they show a resounding majority voted to join Russia. The referendums are widely seen as rigged, as many irregular voting practices have been reported. Electoral officials went door to door with portable ballot boxes to collect votes from residents living in the occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south, and self-proclaimed, pro-Russian "republics" in Donetsk and Luhansk, with polling stations open only yesterday, the last day of voting.|

Much of the occupied territory where the referendums are taking place is cut off from internet and cellphone coverage, or in areas of active military combat making any independent assessment of ballot distribution or vote counting impossible. Russia claims foreign observers are present, though they do not appear to be from internationally recognized bodies. "Electoral commissions accompanied by armed soldiers roam the region and continue to hunt voters," Yurii Sobolevskyi, the first deputy head of the Kherson Regional Council, wrote of the poll workers carrying ballots door-to-door.|

In Zaporizhzhia, the head of the election commission said the final tally was 93.11% in favor.
