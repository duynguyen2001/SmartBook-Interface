## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Russia's international reputation is being significantly damaged due to evidence of war crimes, including the confinement and abuse of minors, and the implementation of legislation restricting freedom of expression and media freedom, such as the 2022 "fake news" law <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This has led to strong international condemnation, with calls for accountability from Western ministers and a UN General Assembly vote rebuking Russia for its actions, which could strain Russia's international relationships <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Russia's international reputation and relationships risk serious damage due to the treatment of minors and journalists during detentions, as evidenced by the deteriorating human rights situation in the country <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Reports of war crimes, including the confinement of children and abuse accusations, have been recorded by a U.N.-mandated investigation commission, which Russia denies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This has led to widespread international condemnation, with the EU in particular criticizing the expansion of restrictive legislation in Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Western ministers, including the US Secretary of State, have called for accountability for Russia's actions and warned of the consequences of failure to do so for global security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The brutal handling and detention of minors and journalists during anti-war protests in Russia have severe implications for Russia's international reputation and relationships <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. With the anti-government protest seeing the largest share of women in recent history, the full scale of the arrests remains unknown, and one minor was reportedly "brutally beaten" by law enforcement <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This disturbing treatment of protesters, particularly minors and journalists, who play a crucial role in providing accurate information in times of conflict, could further tarnish Russia's image globally <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Russia's unjustified aggression against Ukraine has already led to amplified internal repression, targeting ordinary citizens and drastically limiting the right to freedom of expression and media freedom <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The actions of Russian law enforcement forces during the protests, including the detention of journalists, are in direct violation of international humanitarian law and the right to freedom of expression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This could lead to increased international pressure and condemnation, further straining Russia's relationships with other nations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

"In the medium term, this is a problem for the publics trust in Putin and his regime. In the short term, they are not going to get serious protests but rather sabotage," he said, referring to the potential for people who are drafted to undermine the war effort. The declaration Wednesday is only the third time in Russian history that the government has called for military mobilization.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> The prisoner exchange was something of a surprise on a day when tensions between Russia and the West rose even higher after Putin announced the partial mobilization and again blamed the West for the conflict in Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/22/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 22nd, 2022</div></div>| Anti-war protests have erupted in Russia after President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization of the country's military that will see 300,000 reservists sent to war in Ukraine. Ten prisoners of war from five countries, including the U.S. and U.K., have been released after being detained in Russian-held areas of Ukraine on Wednesday as part of a wider prisoner exchange between the warring countries in which several hundred Ukrainian soldiers were exchanged for Russian troops. The prisoner exchange was something of a surprise on a day when tensions between Russia and the West rose even higher after Putin announced the partial mobilization and again blamed the West for the conflict in Ukraine. Following Putin's announcement, President Joe Biden called on the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday to stand in solidarity with Ukraine and oppose Russian aggression, condemning the Kremlin's invasion as an attack on the global body's founding principles.|

A U.N.-mandated investigation commission said it had found evidence of war crimes including executions, rape, torture and confinement of children in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, after visits to 27 areas and interviews with over 150 victims and witnesses. Russia denies targeting civilians and says abuse accusations are a smear campaign. On the battlefield, Ukraine said it had downed four iranian-made "kamikaze" drones over the sea near the port of Odesa.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Russias unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine has amplified internal repression in Russia, targeting ordinary citizens and drastically limiting the right to freedom of expression and media freedom.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/un-geneva/hrc-51-eu-statement-item-4-general-debate-human-rights-situations-require-council%E2%80%99s-attention_en?s=62" target="_blank">eeas.europa.eu</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Those who violate the international law including international humanitarian law will be held accountable. We are deeply concerned at the further deteriorating human rights situation in Russia. Russias unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine has amplified internal repression in Russia, targeting ordinary citizens and drastically limiting the right to freedom of expression and media freedom. The EU strongly condemns the massive expansion of restrictive legislation, including the law on so-called "false information about the use of the armed forces of the Russian Federation" (the 2022 "fake news" law).|

The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally.|

The pogroms of the past lives on in the hearts and memories of Ukrainian Roma. Their impact on refugee relations in the country today is huge, because Ukrainian Roma come to Europe with special baggage. A war of all Ukrainians?|

The watchdog specified the full scale of the arrests remains unknown, however. Nine journalists and 33 minors are also among the detained, it said, adding that one of the minors was "brutally beaten" by law enforcement.|

Police arrested nearly 730 people, including 370 in Moscow and 150 in St Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, an independent website that monitors political arrests in Russia. Some of the arrested were minors. In Moscow, a heavy contingent of police roamed a downtown area where a protest was planned under pouring rain and checked the IDs of passersby.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> But Kolesnikovs research, published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also found that Russian public support for the war against Ukraine is less solid than statistics generally suggest, leading him to believe that Putins mobilisation order might prove to be a costly gamble.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/24/putins-call-up-brings-ukraine-war-home-to-russians" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 24th, 2022</div></div>| "Russian society has been repressed to the core and has become compliant," said Andrei Kolesnikov, of the Carnegie Moscow Center thinktank, who has researched the countrys attitudes towards the conflict. Kolesnikov said that much of Russias population has been forced into a "state of anticipatory obedience", where a perceived inability to influence events encourages people to become passive. But Kolesnikovs research, published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also found that Russian public support for the war against Ukraine is less solid than statistics generally suggest, leading him to believe that Putins mobilisation order might prove to be a costly gamble. "It could prove dangerous for the system to take the armchair warriors sitting in front of the TV and turn them into active participants," he said.|
