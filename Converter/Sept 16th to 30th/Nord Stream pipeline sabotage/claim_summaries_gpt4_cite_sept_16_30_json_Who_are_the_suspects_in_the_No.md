The Swedish national police force is investigating the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline network, with several major political actors implicated. The Council of the European Union and the German Federal Intelligence Service have hinted at Russia's involvement due to the sophisticated technical capabilities required for such an act <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The European Union, represented by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, accuses Russia of deliberately disrupting European energy infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, amid the accusations, NATO suggests the sabotage could be the work of the U.S. or another NATO country, while Poland squarely blames Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. No definitive evidence has been presented yet to confirm the identity of the saboteur(s) <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The Nord Stream pipelines, which transport natural gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, have recently been hit with multiple leaks. The Swedish national police force has opened an investigation into these leaks, which some European Union officials and other major political actors in Europe are attributing to sabotage <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Multiple countries, including the United States, Germany, and Denmark, have suggested that the leaks may have been a targeted attack <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The Council of the European Union has promised a "robust and united response" to the incidents, stating that the leaks appear to be a result of a "deliberate act" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>However, the suspected culprit behind these incidents has not been definitively identified. While some, like the Washington Post and Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, are quick to blame Russia, others are less certain <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Russia, for its part, has suggested that the United States or another NATO country could be responsible <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Nevertheless, no concrete evidence supporting any of these claims has been presented. Swedish authorities have detected multiple underwater blasts on the same day the leaks were discovered, adding to the speculation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Regardless of who is to blame, these incidents have raised concerns about other potential attacks on key underwater infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

It would be the same man who caused domestic inflation here in the U.S. and stole the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton. That be Vladimir Putin. The Washington Post got right to it.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> The EU statement did not name a suspected culprit, but some others in Europe were less reticent in blaming Russia as the most likely cause of the pipeline ruptures, which created a massive methane leak under the Baltic Sea after being detected Monday.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/politico-playbook-daily-briefing-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/28/nord-stream-pipeline-explosions-eu-00059262" target="_blank">Politico Playbook Daily Briefing</a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| In a statement Wednesday, the Council of the European Union promised a "robust and united response" to the incidents, adding that "all available information indicates those leaks are the result of a deliberate act." The EU statement did not name a suspected culprit, but some others in Europe were less reticent in blaming Russia as the most likely cause of the pipeline ruptures, which created a massive methane leak under the Baltic Sea after being detected Monday. "An unnoticed, conspiratorial damage to pipelines at a depth of 80 meters in the Baltic Sea requires sophisticated technical and organizational capabilities that clearly point to a state actor," Gerhard Schindler, former president of the German Federal Intelligence Service, told the German media outlet Welt.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> The European Union says that it was sabotage and blames Russia for what happened even though it would not be in the interest of Russia to cause damage to its own infrastructure.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://hungarytoday.hu/security-of-the-turkstream-is-a-priority-for-hungary/" target="_blank">hungarytoday.hu</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| As the latest news say, Sweden found a new leak in the pipeline on Thursday. Now major political actors are pointing the finger at each other on what or who caused the leaks. The European Union says that it was sabotage and blames Russia for what happened even though it would not be in the interest of Russia to cause damage to its own infrastructure. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that what happened was a "deliberate disruption of active European energy infrastructure."|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> While speculation and finger-pointing abound--with European Union officials suggesting Russia is to blame and Moscow hinting that the U.S. or another NATO country may have been behind the attack--it's not yet clear who was responsible and no credible evidence has been presented by those making accusations.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/common-dreams-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/09/29/climate-scientist-demands-war-crimes-charges-whoever-ordered-pipeline-sabotage" target="_blank">Common Dreams</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| On Thursday, Swedish authorities announced the discovery of a fourth leak in the Nord Stream pipeline network that carries Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea, adding to the three leaks found earlier this week. Sweden said it detected two underwater blasts the same day the first three leaks were discovered. While speculation and finger-pointing abound--with European Union officials suggesting Russia is to blame and Moscow hinting that the U.S. or another NATO country may have been behind the attack--it's not yet clear who was responsible and no credible evidence has been presented by those making accusations. In a statement Thursday, NATO said that "all currently available information indicates that this is the result of deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage."|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> It remains unclear who is responsible for the malfunctioning of both Nord Stream links but Poland squarely blamed Russia.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.intellinews.com/poland-worried-about-baltic-pipe-security-after-nord-stream-explosions-257827/" target="_blank">intellinews.com</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines suffered a sudden loss of pressure and leaked gas in what several countries including the US, Germany, and Denmark suggested may have been a targeted attack on the same day the Baltic Pipe officially opened. The Swedish seismological monitoring network SNSN said on September 27 that it registered two underwater explosions close to where gas leaks were reported. It remains unclear who is responsible for the malfunctioning of both Nord Stream links but Poland squarely blamed Russia. "It is a very strange coincidence that on the same day that we open the Baltic Pipe, someone is most likely committing an act of sabotage.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Swedens Maritime Authority issued a warning about two leaks in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, the day after a leak on the nearby Nord Stream 2 pipeline was discovered that prompted Denmark to restrict shipping and impose a small no fly zone.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/europe-suspects-sabotage-as-mystery-gas-leaks-hit-russian-pipelines/" target="_blank">euractiv.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 27th, 2022</div></div>| Polands Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the leaks were caused by sabotage, while Denmarks prime minister and Russia, which slashed its gas deliveries to Europe after Western sanctions, said it could not be ruled out. But who might be behind any foul play, if proven, and a motive were far from clear. Swedens Maritime Authority issued a warning about two leaks in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, the day after a leak on the nearby Nord Stream 2 pipeline was discovered that prompted Denmark to restrict shipping and impose a small no fly zone. Gas from Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline leaks into Baltic Sea Danish authorities on Monday (26 September) asked ships to steer clear of a five nautical mile radius off the island of Bornholm after a gas leak overnight from the defunct Russian-owned Nord Stream 2 pipeline drained into the Baltic Sea.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Russia has been accused of using the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to put pressure on European countries amid its invasion of Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2022-09-29/could-underwater-drones-have-damaged-the-nord-stream-pipeline" target="_blank">itv.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| But officials have so far avoided pointing a figure directly at possible perpetrators of any sabotage, or speculated as to what damaged the pipes. Neither pipeline was being used at the time, but if the leaks were caused deliberately, it raises worrying possibilities for other attacks on key underwater infrastructure, including communications cables and power lines, and raises the possibility of a hybrid war.

|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Both Europe and Russia have both said sabotage cannot be ruled out as the cause of the damage, but the finger of blame is being pointed squarely at Moscow which has yet to respond directly to the accusations.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/russia-ukraine-war-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| There are widespread fears that Moscow could resort to nuclear weapons to "defend" what it will claim is its territory. Elsewhere, European officials continue to investigate unexplained leaks affecting both the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines that carry natural gas from Russia to Europe via the Baltic Sea. Both Europe and Russia have both said sabotage cannot be ruled out as the cause of the damage, but the finger of blame is being pointed squarely at Moscow which has yet to respond directly to the accusations. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden approved $1.1 billion more in military aid for Ukraine.|
