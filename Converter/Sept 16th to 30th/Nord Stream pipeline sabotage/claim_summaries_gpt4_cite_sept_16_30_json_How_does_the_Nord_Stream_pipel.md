<template v-slot:summary>
The energy standoff concerning Russia's war in Ukraine has affected the Nord Stream pipelines, leading to a halt in gas supply and causing soaring prices in Europe <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This has further escalated the energy war between Europe and Russia, with accusations of Russia using reduced gas supply as an economic weapon against European sanctions; a claim which Moscow denies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Recently, the pipelines have experienced ruptures, and while the U.S. denies any involvement, it's unclear who is responsible for the sabotage <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The damage caused by these events is likely to prevent any gas transportation to Europe, even if the political situation were to change, further exacerbating the energy crisis <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, both of which are filled with natural gas, has sparked fears and escalated tensions in the ongoing energy war between Europe and Russia. The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were not operational at the time of the leaks, therefore, the immediate gas supply to Europe was not affected <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. However, the leaks have overshadowed the launch of the Baltic pipeline that aims to increase Europe's energy independence from Moscow and have caused alarm in Europe due to the potential implications on future gas supplies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Russia's war in Ukraine and the subsequent energy standoff have led to decreased gas supplies from Russia, causing inflated prices in Europe. Despite Russia's denial, the EU has accused Moscow of using gas supplies as an economic weapon in response to sanctions imposed by Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The sabotage of the pipelines, which have been the focal points of the energy war, adds a new dimension to the conflict, raising concerns about potential acts of retaliation and the resulting consequences <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

## Claims
| Claim Sentence | Source | Context |
|---|---|---|
|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The leaks overshadow the inauguration of the long-awaited Baltic pipeline that will bring Norwegian gas to Poland in efforts to bolster Europes energy independence from Moscow.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/27/qa-what-is-known-so-far-about-the-nord-stream-gas-pipeline-leak" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 27th, 2022</div></div>| An energy standoff over Russias war in Ukraine halted flows through Nord Stream 1 and prevented the onset of flows through the parallel Nord Stream 2. Plunging Russian gas supplies have caused prices to soar in Europe, where countries have struggled to find alternative supplies of energy used to heat homes, generate electricity and run factories. The leaks overshadow the inauguration of the long-awaited Baltic pipeline that will bring Norwegian gas to Poland in efforts to bolster Europes energy independence from Moscow. Here is a breakdown of what is known so far:|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> The apparent attack had no immediate effect on European energy supplies; Nord Stream 2 has never gone into service, and Nord Stream 1 has been shut down since August.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/27/world/russia-ukraine-war-news" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Sep 27th, 2022</div></div>| Later, patches of sea surface in the same areas as the explosions began roiling with dangerously combustible gas, forcing shipping to steer clear. Several countries said they were investigating the cause. The apparent attack had no immediate effect on European energy supplies; Nord Stream 2 has never gone into service, and Nord Stream 1 has been shut down since August. But it raises the stakes and European jitters in a simmering energy war between Russia and the West prompted by the war in Ukraine.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Whatever the cause of the damage, it will not immediately affect the supply of gas to Europe, as neither pipeline was operational.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63044747" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The EU has previously accused Russia of using a reduction in gas supplies as an economic weapon, in response to European sanctions imposed because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, Moscow denies this, saying the sanctions have made it impossible to maintain the gas infrastructure properly. Whatever the cause of the damage, it will not immediately affect the supply of gas to Europe, as neither pipeline was operational. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline - which consists of two parallel branches - has not transported any gas since August when Russia closed it down for maintenance.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> The Nord Stream pipelines have been flashpoints in an escalating energy war between capitals in Europe and Moscow that has damaged major Western economies and sent gas prices soaring.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-official-jury-still-out-nord-stream-pipeline-sabotage-2022-09-28/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| I'm just -- I'm not at the point where I can tell you one way or the other." Asked whether any U.S. involvement in the ruptures could be ruled out, the U.S. military official said: "We were absolutely not involved." The Nord Stream pipelines have been flashpoints in an escalating energy war between capitals in Europe and Moscow that has damaged major Western economies and sent gas prices soaring. As gas spewed out under the Baltic Sea for a third day after first being detected, it remained far from clear who might be responsible for any sabotage of the pipelines that Russia and European partners spent billions of dollars building.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Analysts say the damage would likely prevent the pipelines from transporting any gas to Europe even if the political situation changed to allow deliveries.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/deutsche-welle-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/eu-vows-robust-response-after-suspected-gas-pipeline-sabotage/a-63262594" target="_blank">Deutsche Welle</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| They were preceded by two large explosions that were registered by seismologists. The pipelines are both filled with natural gas but are not delivering the fuel to Europe amid tensions with Russia caused by its illegitimate invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Analysts say the damage would likely prevent the pipelines from transporting any gas to Europe even if the political situation changed to allow deliveries. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline has already been used to supply gas, while the Nord Stream 2 pipeline was ready to go into operation before the war in Ukraine put a stop to the venture.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> Both Europe and Russia have both said sabotage cannot be ruled out as the cause of the damage, but the finger of blame is being pointed squarely at Moscow which has yet to respond directly to the accusations.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/russia-ukraine-war-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| There are widespread fears that Moscow could resort to nuclear weapons to "defend" what it will claim is its territory. Elsewhere, European officials continue to investigate unexplained leaks affecting both the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines that carry natural gas from Russia to Europe via the Baltic Sea. Both Europe and Russia have both said sabotage cannot be ruled out as the cause of the damage, but the finger of blame is being pointed squarely at Moscow which has yet to respond directly to the accusations. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden approved $1.1 billion more in military aid for Ukraine.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he thought the leaks would "not have a significant impact on Europe's energy resilience".|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63057966" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The EU has previously accused Russia of using gas supplies as a weapon against the West over its support for Ukraine. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed accusations of sabotage as "predictable, stupid and absurd". The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he thought the leaks would "not have a significant impact on Europe's energy resilience". Neither pipeline is transporting gas at the moment, although they both contain gas.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were not supplying gas to Europe when the leaks were first detected so in the immediate term, the leaks will not affect gas supply to Europe.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2022-09-29/could-underwater-drones-have-damaged-the-nord-stream-pipeline" target="_blank">itv.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| A day later, he added a deliberate attack against allies infrastructure would be met with a determined response. What is the impact of the leaks on gas supplies? The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were not supplying gas to Europe when the leaks were first detected so in the immediate term, the leaks will not affect gas supply to Europe. But it has been estimated that there may be up to 177 million cubic metres of natural gas still residual in Nord Stream 2 alone - the equivalent to the natural gas used by 124,000 UK homes in a year.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> European politicians have warned the incidents at the pipelines could herald a new phase of hybrid warfare in Russia's war against Ukraine to cause damage among Ukraine's western European allies.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/nord-stream-gas-pipeline-leaks-lead-significant-climate-damage-environment-agency" target="_blank">cleanenergywire.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| The cause of the leaks on the two offshore pipelines is being investigated by affected European countries but so far no definite answers have been found. Government representatives in Germany and other countries have said a targeted sabotage act with explosives against the heavily reinforced pipelines on the Baltic Sea's floor are a likely explanation, but clear evidence about what happened and which actors could be responsible remain unknown. European politicians have warned the incidents at the pipelines could herald a new phase of hybrid warfare in Russia's war against Ukraine to cause damage among Ukraine's western European allies.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> If we actually blow up the Nord Stream pipelines, why wouldn't Russia sever undersea internet cables?|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fox-news-editorial-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Right" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-what-happened-nord-stream-pipeline" target="_blank">Fox News (Opinion)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Okay, we've entered a new phase, one in which the United States is directly at war with the largest nuclear power in the world. It doesn't mean we'll go nuclear immediately, but it does suggest there could be consequences. If we actually blow up the Nord Stream pipelines, why wouldn't Russia sever undersea internet cables? What would happen if they did that?|
