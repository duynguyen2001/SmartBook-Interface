The damage to the Nordstream 1 and 2 pipelines, which are currently not operational, has raised concerns about Europe's energy security and its reliance on Russian gas. The pipelines, which are situated in the Baltic Sea, were not transporting gas when the leaks were first detected, but they still contain substantial amounts of residual gas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The EU has previously accused Russia of using gas supplies as a weapon against the West, particularly in response to European sanctions due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, Russia denies this, claiming that the sanctions have hindered the proper maintenance of the gas infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>There is speculation that the pipeline leaks may be due to sabotage, and this has increased tensions between Russia and the West. Although no concrete evidence has been found yet, there are initial reports suggesting that the leaks could be a result of sabotage <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Investigations are underway to determine the cause of the damage, with some suggesting that the incidents could represent a new phase of hybrid warfare in Russia's war against Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The EU enforced a ban on Russian coal imports on 11 August 2022, following Russia's halt of gas supplies to Europe via a major pipeline. Despite this, Europe continues to rely on Russian gas, exacerbating fears of cold winters without it <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

|---|---|---|
|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> However, the nation is no longer considered "a reliable energy partner" after Russia completely halted gas supplies to Europe via a major pipeline, saying repairs were needed.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-russia/" target="_blank">carbonbrief.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 22nd, 2022</div></div>| Additionally, on 11 August 2022, an EU ban on Russian coal imports came into force. Europe still relies on Russian gas amid fears of cold winters without it. However, the nation is no longer considered "a reliable energy partner" after Russia completely halted gas supplies to Europe via a major pipeline, saying repairs were needed. Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of conducting "gas blackmail".|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> European politicians have warned the incidents at the pipelines could herald a new phase of hybrid warfare in Russia's war against Ukraine to cause damage among Ukraine's western European allies.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/nord-stream-gas-pipeline-leaks-lead-significant-climate-damage-environment-agency" target="_blank">cleanenergywire.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| The cause of the leaks on the two offshore pipelines is being investigated by affected European countries but so far no definite answers have been found. Government representatives in Germany and other countries have said a targeted sabotage act with explosives against the heavily reinforced pipelines on the Baltic Sea's floor are a likely explanation, but clear evidence about what happened and which actors could be responsible remain unknown. European politicians have warned the incidents at the pipelines could herald a new phase of hybrid warfare in Russia's war against Ukraine to cause damage among Ukraine's western European allies.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> The leaks overshadow the inauguration of the long-awaited Baltic pipeline that will bring Norwegian gas to Poland in efforts to bolster Europes energy independence from Moscow.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/27/qa-what-is-known-so-far-about-the-nord-stream-gas-pipeline-leak" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 27th, 2022</div></div>| An energy standoff over Russias war in Ukraine halted flows through Nord Stream 1 and prevented the onset of flows through the parallel Nord Stream 2. Plunging Russian gas supplies have caused prices to soar in Europe, where countries have struggled to find alternative supplies of energy used to heat homes, generate electricity and run factories. The leaks overshadow the inauguration of the long-awaited Baltic pipeline that will bring Norwegian gas to Poland in efforts to bolster Europes energy independence from Moscow. Here is a breakdown of what is known so far:|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Now, my understanding is the leaks will not have a significant impact on Europes energy resilience, and whats critical is that we are working day in, day out both on a short-term basis and a long-term basis to address energy security for Europe and, for that matter, around the world.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-indian-external-affairs-minister-dr-subrahmanyam-jaishankar-at-a-joint-press-availability-2/" target="_blank">state.gov</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| There are initial reports indicating that this may be the result of an attack or some kind of sabotage, but these are initial reports and we havent confirmed that yet. But if it is confirmed, thats clearly in no ones interest. Now, my understanding is the leaks will not have a significant impact on Europes energy resilience, and whats critical is that we are working day in, day out both on a short-term basis and a long-term basis to address energy security for Europe and, for that matter, around the world. Short term just to cite a few examples we are working on implementing the oil price cap to keep Russian oil flowing, but at a steep discount.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Whatever the cause of the damage, it will not immediately affect the supply of gas to Europe, as neither pipeline was operational.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63044747" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The EU has previously accused Russia of using a reduction in gas supplies as an economic weapon, in response to European sanctions imposed because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, Moscow denies this, saying the sanctions have made it impossible to maintain the gas infrastructure properly. Whatever the cause of the damage, it will not immediately affect the supply of gas to Europe, as neither pipeline was operational. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline - which consists of two parallel branches - has not transported any gas since August when Russia closed it down for maintenance.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> These leaks are causing risks to shipping and substantial environmental damage.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_207733.htm" target="_blank">nato.int</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| The damage to the Nordstream 1 and Nordstream 2 pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea is of deep concern. All currently available information indicates that this is the result of deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage. These leaks are causing risks to shipping and substantial environmental damage. We support the investigations underway to determine the origin of the damage.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he thought the leaks would "not have a significant impact on Europe's energy resilience".|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63057966" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The EU has previously accused Russia of using gas supplies as a weapon against the West over its support for Ukraine. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed accusations of sabotage as "predictable, stupid and absurd". The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he thought the leaks would "not have a significant impact on Europe's energy resilience". Neither pipeline is transporting gas at the moment, although they both contain gas.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were not supplying gas to Europe when the leaks were first detected so in the immediate term, the leaks will not affect gas supply to Europe.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2022-09-29/could-underwater-drones-have-damaged-the-nord-stream-pipeline" target="_blank">itv.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| A day later, he added a deliberate attack against allies infrastructure would be met with a determined response. What is the impact of the leaks on gas supplies? The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were not supplying gas to Europe when the leaks were first detected so in the immediate term, the leaks will not affect gas supply to Europe. But it has been estimated that there may be up to 177 million cubic metres of natural gas still residual in Nord Stream 2 alone - the equivalent to the natural gas used by 124,000 UK homes in a year.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Mateusz Morawiecki, Polands prime minister, blamed Russia for the leaks, saying they were an attempt to further destabilize Europes energy security.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/27/world/russia-ukraine-war-news" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Sep 27th, 2022</div></div>| But it raises the stakes and European jitters in a simmering energy war between Russia and the West prompted by the war in Ukraine.
