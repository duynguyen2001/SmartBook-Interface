Russian-backed local administrations in occupied areas of Ukraine played a crucial role in orchestrating the referendums, which have been widely denounced as sham and illegitimate by the West. They announced the plans for these referendums, which aimed to legitimise the regions' declaration of independence and subsequent annexation by Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that Moscow would recognise the results of the referendums, a stance reminiscent of Russia's handling of the Crimean annexation in 2014 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>The referendums were hastily organised, with voting taking place in the Russian-controlled regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, which account for approximately 15% of Ukrainian territory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Voting practices were reportedly manipulated to ensure a favourable outcome for Russia, including forcing residents to vote under military supervision and the use of portable ballot boxes for door-to-door vote collection <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The results, unsurprisingly, showed a vast majority in favour of joining Russia, thus providing a pretext for Russia to escalate its military response should Ukraine attempt to recapture these areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The referendums could pave the way for Russian annexation of the areas, allowing Moscow to frame the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive there as an attack on Russia itself, thereby providing Moscow with a pretext to escalate its military response.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-21-22/h_7666f140f0a451c554d0f2011058de69" target="_blank">edition.cnn.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 21st, 2022</div></div>| Multiple Kremlin-backed authorities in occupied areas of eastern and southern Ukraine have announced they will hold referendums on formally joining Russia this week, in a move that threatens to redefine the parameters of the conflict. The referendums could pave the way for Russian annexation of the areas, allowing Moscow to frame the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive there as an attack on Russia itself, thereby providing Moscow with a pretext to escalate its military response. The latest developments follow a significant shift in Russia's position after a sudden and successful Ukrainian offensive through most of occupied Kharkiv this month, which has galvanized Ukraine's Western backers and led to recriminations in Moscow.|

Just as it did with the Crimean annexation in 2014, Russia is making a point of appearing not to be involved. It was local Ukrainian politicians supported by the Russian military who announced the so-called "referendums." As in the case of Crimea eight years ago, the vote was brought forward from a previously suggested date that of November 4.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> They have been widely condemned in the west as illegitimate, and appear to be a thin attempt to provide cover for illegal annexation of the regions by Moscow.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/23/occupied-parts-of-ukraine-prepare-to-vote-on-joining-russia" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 23rd, 2022</div></div>| So-called "referendums" are under way in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian troops, with residents told to vote on proposals for the four Ukrainian regions to declare independence and then join Russia. The polls, hastily organised after being announced this week, are due to run until Tuesday. They have been widely condemned in the west as illegitimate, and appear to be a thin attempt to provide cover for illegal annexation of the regions by Moscow. Russian news agencies said voting in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces began on Friday morning.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Russian state media yesterday claimed the military was involved for security reasons but critics say the tactics are being used to ensure a higher turnout as part of a cynical Kremlin propaganda campaign.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-mail" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Right" /></a><div><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-11246381/PETER-HITCHENS-questions-wisdom-stoking-Ukraine-conflict-despite-threat-nuclear-armageddon.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 24th, 2022</div></div>| Gun-toting Russian troops are going door to door in occupied areas of Ukraine to force people to vote in Vladimir Putins controversial referendums on whether they want to become part of Russia. As desperate Russian men try to avoid being drafted into the war in Ukraine including breaking their own arms security camera footage has shown heavily armed soldiers accompanying officials who are organising the referendum that Western leaders say is a sham. Russian state media yesterday claimed the military was involved for security reasons but critics say the tactics are being used to ensure a higher turnout as part of a cynical Kremlin propaganda campaign. A woman in the southern town of Enerhodar told the BBC: People are being asked to answer verbally and then a soldier marks the response on the sheet of paper.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> The outcome of the referendums is widely believed to have been predetermined by the Kremlin, prompting the U.S. and its allies to denounce them as a "sham."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/23/russia-ukraine-war-putins-nuclear-threats-raise-the-risk-of-disaster.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 23rd, 2022</div></div>| It comes as pro-Moscow regional leaders in areas of southern and eastern Ukraine announced referendums on joining Russia. The votes are expected to take place in the Russia-controlled regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, reportedly amounting to roughly 15% of Ukrainian territory. The outcome of the referendums is widely believed to have been predetermined by the Kremlin, prompting the U.S. and its allies to denounce them as a "sham." Political analysts say the Kremlin may then view Ukrainian military action against these four areas as an attack against Russia itself.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The referendums are widely seen as rigged, as many irregular voting practices have been reported.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/russia-ukraine-war-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 28th, 2022</div></div>| After a series of sham referendums in four Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, the results are out. Unsurprisingly, they show a resounding majority voted to join Russia. The referendums are widely seen as rigged, as many irregular voting practices have been reported. Electoral officials went door to door with portable ballot boxes to collect votes from residents living in the occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south, and self-proclaimed, pro-Russian "republics" in Donetsk and Luhansk, with polling stations open only yesterday, the last day of voting.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Within the occupied territories, Russian-installed officials took ballot boxes from house to house in what Ukraine and the West said was an illegitimate, coercive exercise to create a legal pretext for Russia to annex the four regions.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moscows-proxies-occupied-ukraine-regions-report-big-votes-join-russia-2022-09-27/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 27th, 2022</div></div>| Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said 99.2% of participants in the region had voted to join Russia. All four areas said all ballots had been counted. Within the occupied territories, Russian-installed officials took ballot boxes from house to house in what Ukraine and the West said was an illegitimate, coercive exercise to create a legal pretext for Russia to annex the four regions. Russian President Vladimir Putin could then portray any Ukrainian attempt to recapture them as an attack on Russia itself.|

For women in Russia, the choice is to lose their husbands, sons, grandchildren forever, or still try to protect them from death, from war, from one person," Zelenskiy said. The hastily announced referendums were set up by the Kremlin-installed leaders of the four regions. They gave no prior warning that they planned to hold the vote on annexation between September 23- 27.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> The referendum plans were suddenly announced a week ago by Russian-backed local administrations and immediately welcomed in Moscow.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-27-22/h_2bfd5da22ea1ddcb7a04adaf40ffcc19" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 27th, 2022</div></div>| RIA Novosti claimed that "The public addressed the authorities of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions with a proposal to urgently hold referendums." There is no evidence of that. The referendum plans were suddenly announced a week ago by Russian-backed local administrations and immediately welcomed in Moscow. Ukrainian officials say that turnout has been extremely low and claimed that people had been bused in from Crimea to add to the turnout.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Vladimir Putin's Russia took a dangerous and irreversible step by recognising two regions of war-torn Ukraine as independent states ahead of the biggest military annexation of European territory since the Second World War - after Moscow staged a series of fake referendums there and rigged the results at gunpoint.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-mail" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Right" /></a><div><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11264631/Putin-signs-decree-recognising-two-Ukrainian-regions-independent-states-sham-referendums.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 29th, 2022</div></div>| Advertisement Vladimir Putin's Russia took a dangerous and irreversible step by recognising two regions of war-torn Ukraine as independent states ahead of the biggest military annexation of European territory since the Second World War - after Moscow staged a series of fake referendums there and rigged the results at gunpoint. The Kremlin dictator last night signed decrees recognising Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the country's south and east as states independent of Volodymyr Zelensky's Government - a precursor to Putin's deranged plot to illegally absorb 15% of Ukrainian territory into the Russian Federation.|
