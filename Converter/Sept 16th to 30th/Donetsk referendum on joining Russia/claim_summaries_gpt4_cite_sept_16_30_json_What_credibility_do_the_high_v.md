## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The high voter turnout claims from Russian-backed authorities in the occupied Ukrainian regions are widely disputed, with allegations of intimidation and forced voting cast doubt on the legitimacy of these referendums <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. International authorities and locals reject these claims, describing them as a "sham" and a farcical representation of democracy, with some residents reporting that they were made to vote at gunpoint and others refusing to participate altogether <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Russian-backed authorities claim high voter turnout in the so-called referendums on the accession to the Russian Federation in occupied parts of Ukraine, a claim that is viewed with suspicion by Ukrainian and Western officials due to allegations of forced voting and intimidation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Some residents such as Lyubomir Boyko from Kherson province reported that only a few people who switched sides voted <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Voting statistics released by Russian news agencies indicate that voter turnout in the Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions ranged from 15% to 23.6% <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, considering Russia's history of manipulated voting outcomes, like the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the 1940 elections in Baltic states, the credibility of these turnout claims is questionable <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Russian-backed authorities in occupied parts of Ukraine claim high voter turnout in the so-called referendums on accession to the Russian Federation. However, these claims are highly disputed, with allegations of voter intimidation and forced voting <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Reports from inside the territories suggest that some individuals are made to vote at gunpoint and that Russian forces are staging votes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The turnout figures reported by Russian authorities are rejected by local residents, such as Lyubomir Boyko from Golo Pristan, who claimed that no one voted except for a few who switched sides <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The credibility of the high voter turnout claims is undermined by the international community and the Ukrainian government who have labeled the referendums as a "sham" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

Western and Ukrainian officials condemn the referendums as a sham they say will allow Putin to annex the territories, and then use them to justify deploying nuclear weapons to protect them. Moscow says the referendums are legitimate.|

Russia says voting was voluntary, in line with international law, and that turnout was high. The referendums and notion of annexations has been rejected globally, as was Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea from Ukraine.|

The outcome of the referendaa misnomer, given the coercive methods used to carry them outhardly came as a surprise. Russia has a long history of cosplaying democracy, from its 2014 referendum on the annexation of Crimea (in which 97% of voters purportedly voted to join the Russian Federation, though the actual result is thought to have been closer to 15%) to the staged elections in 1940 that paved the way for Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to join the Soviet Union that year. Then, as now, the votes represented farcical facsimiles of democracy that were designed to obfuscate rather than convince.|

International observers and the Ukrainian government expressed similar concerns in 2014, when Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea after a referendum carried out in the presence of Russian troops. The individuals are suspected of violating Ukraine's criminal code on "collaboration" and "encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability" of Ukraine. The SBU said that the four men, "in collusion with other persons," appealed to the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics "with the initiative of holding a fake referendum on the territories temporarily occupied by the enemy, and also proposed immediate separation from Ukraine and joining the Russian Federation."|

Fighting continues in all four regions. British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Russian-installed officials in the regions were setting targets for invented voter turnouts and approval rates, with some turnout figures already agreed. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, while the Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas - which is comprised of Donetsk and Luhansk - sought to break away from Kyiv's control.|

If witness reports from Kurumkan are accurate, they would indicate that Russian officials mobilized about 25% of the male population from a single village in a majority ethnically Buryat district. An Armenian Telegram channel published a mobilization list from Tuapse, Krasnodar Krai that reportedly consists of 90% ethnically Armenian residents, despite the towns total Armenian community being only 8.5% of the population. The Kremlins heavy-handed approach to mobilization is prompting public anger and distrust across Russia.|

The plans, which are being held under military occupation and effectively carried out at gunpoint, have been strongly condemned by both the government of Ukraine and its allies in the West. The European Union has said it wont recognize the results and has indicated it is preparing a new package of sanctions against Russia.|
