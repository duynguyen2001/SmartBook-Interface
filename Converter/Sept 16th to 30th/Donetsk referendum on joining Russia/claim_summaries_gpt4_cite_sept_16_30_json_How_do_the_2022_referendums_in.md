<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The 2022 referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk, held amid the advance of Russian forces, mirror the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, with pro-Russian officials organizing a vote that has been internationally criticized as a preordained sham <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Just as in 2014, Russia is using the same tactics of taking control of regions, conducting referendums under their supervision, and claiming high support for annexation, despite international denouncement and concerns over the legitimacy of the process <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Pro-Russian leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk are conducting referendums on joining Russia, mirroring the scenario of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The referendums, like the one in Crimea in 2014, are regarded as a "sham" by the Ukrainian authorities and Western countries, with outcomes largely predetermined <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Similar to the Crimea annexation, Russia has taken control of some regions, and the votes are also planned in other occupied regions like Zaporizhzhia and Kherson <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The process has been critiqued for its likeness to the 2014 Crimea referendum, which was hastily carried out and saw more than 95% of voters opting to join Russia, according to official outcomes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk in 2022 mirror the tactics used by Russia during the annexation of Crimea in 2014 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Both situations involved pro-Russian leaders in occupied Ukrainian territories holding votes on joining Russia, a process that has been widely criticized as a sham with preordained outcomes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. These votes were carried out under the presence and influence of Russian forces, thus questioning their legitimacy and fairness <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>The referendums could potentially pave the way for Russia's annexation of more Ukrainian territory, similar to the seizure of Crimea in 2014 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Such a move could allow Russia to frame any Ukrainian counteroffensive as an attack on Russia itself, providing a pretext to escalate its military response <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. International observers and the Ukrainian government had expressed similar concerns during the 2014 annexation of Crimea, when official outcomes suggested an overwhelming majority in favor of joining Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
