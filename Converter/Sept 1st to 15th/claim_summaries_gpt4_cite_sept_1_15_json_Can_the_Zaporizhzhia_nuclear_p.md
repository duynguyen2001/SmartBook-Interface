Cars drove through darkened streets, and the few pedestrians used flashlights or mobile phones to light their way. Separately, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the Russia-occupied south completely shut down in a bid to prevent a radiation disaster as fighting raged nearby. Kyiv's action in recent days to reclaim Russia-occupied areas in the Kharkiv region forced Moscow to withdraw its troops to prevent them from being surrounded, leaving behind significant numbers of weapons and munitions in a hasty flight as the war marked its 200th day on Sunday.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> On Monday, renewed shelling caused a fire that once again led to the plant being disconnected from Ukraines national power grid, which Ukraines energy minister said placed critical cooling systems at risk of relying solely on emergency backup power.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/06/world/ukraine-russia-war" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Sep 6th, 2022</div></div>| For weeks, fighting around the large facility which was seized by Russian forces in March but is operated by Ukrainian engineers has raised fears of a nuclear accident. A dry spent fuel storage facility was damaged last month and, in recent days, there has been a fire and loss of outside power to the plant. On Monday, renewed shelling caused a fire that once again led to the plant being disconnected from Ukraines national power grid, which Ukraines energy minister said placed critical cooling systems at risk of relying solely on emergency backup power. "While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance," the report said.|
