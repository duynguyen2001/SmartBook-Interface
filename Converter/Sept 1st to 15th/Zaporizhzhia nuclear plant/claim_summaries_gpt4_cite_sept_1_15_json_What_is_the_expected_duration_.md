<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The IAEA team's initial visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is expected to last "a few days," with the purpose of preventing a nuclear accident, but two IAEA experts will remain at the plant indefinitely <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The duration of the team's stay could be extended if they can establish a "nuclear safety and security protection zone" and ensure that plant operators can carry out their responsibilities and maintain communication, as well as work without hindrance under the control of Russian soldiers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The IAEA team's stay at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was initially expected to last "a few days," with the aim to prevent a nuclear accident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This mission was extended when two IAEA experts remained at the plant indefinitely after the initial visit <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The length of their stay could be influenced by their ability to establish a "nuclear safety and security protection zone" around the plant, as recommended by the IAEA <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The team's work and the duration of their stay may also be affected by whether they can carry out their responsibilities without hindrance and maintain communication, as stressed by Guterres <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on September 1, 2022, with the main objective to prevent a nuclear accident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The duration of their stay is largely uncertain; however, the IAEA Director General, Rafael Grossi, initially stated that the technical visit was expected to last "a few days" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Subsequently, Grossi stated that two IAEA experts will remain at the plant indefinitely <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This suggests that while the initial mission was short-term, there has been a shift towards establishing a continued presence at the site <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The duration of the IAEA team's stay could be influenced by several factors. One key factor is the need to establish a "nuclear safety and security protection zone" around the power plant <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, highlighted the need for plant operators to carry out their responsibilities and maintain communications, and for the IAEA experts to work without hindrance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Another influencing factor is the ongoing conflict and accusations of sabotage from both Russia and Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the IAEA chief is also requesting the military to hand back the occupied crisis center, suggesting that the situation on the ground will likely impact the timeline of the IAEA's mission <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
