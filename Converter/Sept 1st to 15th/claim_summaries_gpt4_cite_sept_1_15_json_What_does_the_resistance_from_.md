In a rare display of dissent in Russia, the local deputies from the Smolninskoye municipality appealed to the Russian Duma to impeach Putin for what they called crimes of high treason. Palyuga and fellow deputy Nikita Yuferev later posted on Twitter a summons issued to them by the St. Petersburg police for "discrediting of the ruling establishment."|

Now those deputies face charges of "discrediting" the Russian army, according to a tweet by one of them, Nikita Yuferev. Municipal deputies are local officials with limited political influence. The petition follows Russia's first regional and municipal elections since the start of the war, in which pro-Kremlin candidates were overwhelmingly successful.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> They also served as evidence that public support for the war in Ukraine is not universal, and could be eroding as a recent survey of Russian public opinion found.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/09/lawmakers-putin-impeachment-censure-war/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 9th, 2022</div></div>| A second municipal council in Moscows Lomonosovsky district followed suit and voted on a similar motion calling on Putin to resign. Outspoken criticism of Putin is rare, and while the two motions were little more than symbolic statements, they represented a remarkable public rebuke. They also served as evidence that public support for the war in Ukraine is not universal, and could be eroding as a recent survey of Russian public opinion found. "We believe that the decision made by President Putin to start the special military operation is detrimental to the security of Russia and its citizens," the Smolninsky document filed on Wednesday evening said.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> While posing no current threat to Putin's grip on power, the moves mark rare expressions of dissent by elected representatives at a time when Russians risk heavy prison sentences for "discrediting" the armed forces or spreading "deliberately false information" about them.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/13/09/2022/russian-council-faces-dissolution-after-call-for-putins-removal" target="_blank">thepeninsulaqatar.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 13th, 2022</div></div>| Last week, a group of deputies from the council appealed to the State Duma to bring charges of state treason against Putin and strip him of power, citing a series of reasons including Russia's military losses in Ukraine and the damage to its economy from Western sanctions. Another local deputy said 65 municipal representatives from St Petersburg, Moscow and several other regions had signed a petition she published on Monday calling for Putin's resignation. While posing no current threat to Putin's grip on power, the moves mark rare expressions of dissent by elected representatives at a time when Russians risk heavy prison sentences for "discrediting" the armed forces or spreading "deliberately false information" about them. Palyuga told Reuters before Tuesday's hearing that the group's appeals were aimed not only at liberal Russians but also at "people loyal to the authorities who are starting to have doubts when they see the lack of success of the Russian army".|

He would have failed a freshman exam in realist international relations theory. After Gorbachev had successfully reformed the Soviet system out of existence and enabled the precipitous rejection of party rule in Eastern Europe, that example of decolonization became a powerful incentive, first to dissident nationalists in Armenia, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and later to Communists in the non-Russian republics, to strike out on their own and declare sovereignty or independence. Even the old Communist Yeltsin discovered nationalism: after repeatedly defending the unity of the Soviet Union, he encouraged non-Russians both inside and outside the Russian Republic to take as much power as they were able.|
