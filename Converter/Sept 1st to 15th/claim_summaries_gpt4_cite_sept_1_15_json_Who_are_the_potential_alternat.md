<template v-slot:less-detailed>
If a price cap is implemented, Russia could potentially trade oil with alternative partners like China and India, who may not follow the G7 policy on Russian oil and have not joined the Western sanctions targeting Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister and spokesperson did not name these alternative oil partners, but stated that they are more numerous than before <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

If a price cap is implemented, Russia has indicated plans to trade with alternative oil partners, though specific countries were not named <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Countries that refuse to abide by the G7 price cap, such as China and India, could continue to be recipients of Russian oil <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Prior to the invasion, India had imported almost no Russian oil <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>, suggesting a potential expansion of trading relationships. However, redirecting oil supplies to alternative customers like China is a complex task, with significant logistical challenges such as distance and the need for new infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Russia has warned that if a price cap is imposed on its oil, it will suspend supplies to countries adhering to these limits and seek "alternative directions" for its trade <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These alternative partners are not explicitly named, but it is suggested that they could be more numerous than before <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. It's indicated that Russia may intend to divert its vast oil and gas supplies towards Asian powers like China and India if the West tries to cap prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. These two countries, major trading partners for Russia, have been snapping up heavily-discounted oil from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine and have not joined the Western sanctions targeting Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>However, redirecting its energy supplies will not be without challenges for Russia. For instance, re-routing gas from Siberia to China would require the construction of a new pipeline spanning 3,000 km, a costly and time-consuming endeavor <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Still, most countries outside the Western bloc have refused to join the sanctions regime, with India capitalizing on discounted Russian oil and Saudi Arabia continuing to engage with Russia as part of the OPEC+ oil producers cartel <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America are also potential partners, as they are largely focused on their own economic aspirations and managing their internal crises <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, Moscow has continued to earn billions of dollars a month by diverting oil to countries such as China and India <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

Of course the gas prices from the other countries are more expensive than that of Russia, but Russia's current gas price is no longer cheap, since Russia intends to raise the price of her gas from 3,500 (the current top price) to 5,000 Euros per one thousand cubic meters by the end of 2022 ------ if Russia keeps selling gas to her western neighbors, that is.|

It will apply to crude shipped by tanker and most piped supplies. China and India - major trading partners for Russia - may not follow G7 policy on Russian oil, analysts say. They have not joined the Western sanctions targeting Russia.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> But Russia could continue to export oil to countries that refuse to abide by the G7 price cap, eg China and India.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cadtm.org/Energy-cost-of-living-and-recession" target="_blank">cadtm.org</a></div><div></div><div>Nov 27th, 2023</div></div>| Russia could refuse to export oil at the lower price, though that would not only reduce one of its few sources of external revenue, it also would require shutting down oil wells that arent easily restarted. An extended shutdown of Russian oil wells could do severe and lasting damage to its production capacity. But Russia could continue to export oil to countries that refuse to abide by the G7 price cap, eg China and India. Indeed, before the invasion, India imported almost no Russian oil.|

Peskov confirmed Novak's statement Friday saying that Russia will not have oil trade with countries that will join these restrictions. "Those countries that join the potential price ceiling will not be among the recipients of Russian oil," he said adding that the Russian oil will go to "alternative directions" instead. Peskov refused to name the alternative oil partners Russia is planning to trade with, but said "they are more numerous than before."|

Selling oil and gas westwards has been one of Russia's most profitable trades since the Soviet Union built pipelines to Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, often in the face of fierce opposition from the United States. Re-routing gas from the Urengoy field in northern Siberia to alternative customers such as China is no simple task: the Chinese border is 3,000 km (1864.11 miles) away and a pipeline would take time and money to build.

The G7 wealthy nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- and the EU are hammering out details of the plan. The G7 wants to enlist other countries, including India and China, which have been snapping up heavily-discounted oil from Russia since its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Moscow has managed to maintain its revenues through those increased crude sales to India and China.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Putin, who turns 70 in October, has repeatedly said that if Europe does not want to buy Russian oil and gas, or if it tries to cap prices, then Russia will redirect its vast supplies in a major tilt towards Asian powers such as China and India.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/analysis-putins-energy-gamble-may-prove-a-double-edged-sword-for-russia/" target="_blank">euractiv.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 8th, 2022</div></div>| Locked into a confrontation with the West over Ukraine, Putin is playing his energy cards again, a lever which Moscow can use against a US-dominated global financial system. He says that Russia had gained, not lost, from the conflict because it was embarking on a new path. Putin, who turns 70 in October, has repeatedly said that if Europe does not want to buy Russian oil and gas, or if it tries to cap prices, then Russia will redirect its vast supplies in a major tilt towards Asian powers such as China and India. But to do so, Russia would need to accelerate the construction of its pipelines eastwards, the document said.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Hence, the availability of Russian oil will be reduced to G7 nations thus causing further price increases in the global oil market and aggravating the energy crises even more," Rasmussen said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/world-int/22156-price-cap-on-russian-oil-to-worsen-energy-crisis-backfire-on-g7-countries-expert.html" target="_blank">helsinkitimes.fi</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 5th, 2022</div></div>| Imposing a price cap simply may eliminate oil supplies from Russia to the West, while Moscow will be able to easily find new clients in other regions unless G7 plans to impose secondary sanctions on those countries who will follow general market rules, he noted. "Such use of secondary sanctions will further compromise the global energy market. Hence, the availability of Russian oil will be reduced to G7 nations thus causing further price increases in the global oil market and aggravating the energy crises even more," Rasmussen said. The United States will not get benefits from this situation unless it increases its own oil exploration, the expert said.|

India might be inching toward alignment with the West in the Indo-Pacific, but it has gorged on discounted Russian oil. Saudi Arabia has continued to embrace Russia as part of the OPEC+ oil producers cartel, rejecting U.S. calls to expel Moscow from the club. Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America are largely focused on their own economic aspirationsand managing food shortages and inflation exacerbated by the war.|

The Biden administration has been pushing for governments to introduce a price cap for months. The West has already sanctioned many Russian energy exports, but Moscow has continued to earn billions of dollars a month by diverting oil to countries such as China and India. "The price cap is specifically designed to reduce Russian revenues and Russias ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russia s war on global energy prices, particularly for low and middle-income countries," the G7 finance ministers said.|
