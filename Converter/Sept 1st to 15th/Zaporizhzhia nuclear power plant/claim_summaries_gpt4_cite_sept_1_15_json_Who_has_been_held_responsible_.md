Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling dangerously close to the plant. The damage to critical infrastructure around the facility has been significant, and there are fears more damage could lead to a radiation disaster in the country that still manages the cleanup of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="2"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Both Ukraine and Russia accuse each other of repeatedly shelling the plant.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/4/infographic-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 4th, 2022</div></div>| The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected from its last external power line. However, the facility is still managing to supply electricity to the grid through a reserve line. Both Ukraine and Russia accuse each other of repeatedly shelling the plant. The UNs IAEA warns that damage to the facility could lead to a nuclear disaster.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="3"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[3]</font> The plant and surrounding areas have been repeatedly hit by shelling that Russia and Ukraine blame on each other.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/pbs-newshour" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/europes-largest-nuclear-plant-still-in-danger-as-ukraine-reclaims-some-eastern-territory" target="_blank">PBS NewsHour</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 9th, 2022</div></div>| That prompted the head of the U.N. atomic watchdog to call for the establishment of an immediate safety zone around the plant to prevent a nuclear accident. The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant came under the control of Russian forces early in the war but is being operated by Ukrainian staff. The plant and surrounding areas have been repeatedly hit by shelling that Russia and Ukraine blame on each other. The last power line connecting the plant to the Ukrainian electricity grid was cut Monday, leaving the plant without an outside source of electricity.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="4"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Mr Grossi did not say whether Russia or Ukraine was responsible for the shelling, but said that it must stop immediately.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62855104" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| "This is completely unacceptable. It cannot stand." Mr Grossi did not say whether Russia or Ukraine was responsible for the shelling, but said that it must stop immediately. Both countries have blamed each other for fighting in the vicinity of the plant, which is close to the front line and has been occupied, along with Enerhodar, by the Russians since early in the invasion.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="5"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[5]</font> It has come under repeated shelling over the past month, with Kyiv and Moscow trading blame for the firing.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/voice-america" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/latest-developments-in-ukraine-sept-2/6728025.html" target="_blank">Voice of America (VOA)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 2nd, 2022</div></div>| Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Ukraine was continuing to shell the plant, raising the risk of a nuclear catastrophe. The site, 10 km (6 miles) from Ukrainian positions across the Dnipro river, was captured by Russian forces soon after they invaded Ukraine in late February and has become the focus of concern. It has come under repeated shelling over the past month, with Kyiv and Moscow trading blame for the firing. The plant is still run by Ukrainian staff and Russia has rejected calls for it to withdraw its troops.|

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been held by Russian forces since early March, but is still operated by Ukrainian staff. The IAEA director general visited the power plant last week, and two IAEA experts stayed to maintain a permanent presence at the plant.|

Separately, Ukraine's state nuclear company said only one of the station's six reactors now remains in operation. Both Ukraine and Russia accuse each other of repeatedly shelling the plant. Inspectors from the IAEA arrived at the nuclear plant on Thursday amid security concerns.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="8"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[8]</font> Both countries have blamed the other for the shelling around the plant.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/06/world/ukraine-russia-war" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Sep 6th, 2022</div></div>| The report noted that the plants workers are under "constant high stress and pressure," saying the situation was "not sustainable." One worker was injured by shelling last month, according to the report. Both countries have blamed the other for the shelling around the plant. "The hits that this facility has received, and that I could personally see and assess together with my experts, is simply unacceptable," Mr. Grossi told the United Nations Security Council later Tuesday.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="9"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[9]</font> In particular, Russia objected to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant, and its delegate suggested other countries had also voiced concerns about the draft outcome document.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.ibanet.org/nuclear-weapons-treaty-review-ukraine" target="_blank">ibanet.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Cadman says that Russian President Vladimir Putins threats are a violation of Article II of the 1973 bilateral Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War, by which the US and Russia pledged to refrain from the threat or use of force against the other Party, against the allies of the other Party and against other countries, in circumstances which may endanger international peace and security. The tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which took place throughout August, concluded without reaching agreement on substantive conclusions and recommendations due to Russias opposition to a summary document presented by the Conferences presidency. In particular, Russia objected to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant, and its delegate suggested other countries had also voiced concerns about the draft outcome document. Such a failure defeats every possible hope of maintaining an arms control regime, says Cadman.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="10"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[10]</font> Since the early days of the conflict, the plant has been controlled by Russian troops but operated by Ukrainian staff.</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/un-team-inspect-ukrainian-nuclear-plant-mission-avert-disaster-2022-09-01/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 1st, 2022</div></div>| Ukraine's nuclear power operator Energoatom said five team members would stay on for two more days. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of trying to sabotage the IAEA mission to the plant, which sits on the south bank of a huge reservoir on the Dnipro River that divides Russian and Ukrainian forces in central southern Ukraine. Since the early days of the conflict, the plant has been controlled by Russian troops but operated by Ukrainian staff. Conditions at the plant have been unravelling for weeks, with Moscow and Kyiv regularly trading blame for shelling in the vicinity, fuelling fears of a Chornobyl-style radiation disaster.|
