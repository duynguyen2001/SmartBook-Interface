Hesse: Clearly, the only way to ensure the safety of the plant is to remove Russian forces from its premises and establish a demilitarized zone in the surrounding area. This would enable the IAEA team to travel safely to the facility, conduct an inspection, and assess the nuclear safety, security, and application of safeguards at the ZNPP.|

How much can the inspectors change at the plant? The missions mandate is concerned with three elements within the Zaporizhzhia facility: the safety of its operations, the security of the facility overall, and the safeguarding of nuclear material produced there. The mission can collect information about these elements and disseminate it, but "these are inspectors, they cant decide to start operating the plant in a certain way if they feel like its not being operated in a safe manner," Roecker said.|
