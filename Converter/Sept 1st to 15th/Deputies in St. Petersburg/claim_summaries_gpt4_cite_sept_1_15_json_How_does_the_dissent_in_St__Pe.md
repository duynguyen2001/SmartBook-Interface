<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Amid the Ukraine-Russia crisis in 2022, a rare display of public dissent in Russia has emerged as elected deputies from the St. Petersburg area, along with others from Moscow and several regions, have called for the impeachment or resignation of President Vladimir Putin, citing allegations of high treason, military losses in Ukraine, and damage to the economy from Western sanctions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. However, this opposition poses significant personal risk due to laws criminalizing anti-war dissent and the dissemination of "fake news" on the Ukraine conflict, which could result in heavy prison sentences, reflecting the Kremlin's stringent crackdown on any dissent <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

During the 2022 Ukraine-Russia crisis, elected deputies from the Smolninskoye municipality in St. Petersburg displayed rare public dissent by calling for the impeachment of Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing crimes of high treason <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The deputies, along with dozens of elected representatives from Moscow, appealed to the Russian Duma and demanded Putin's resignation, alleging vote rigging in local elections and military failures in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The deputies' actions pose a significant risk, as laws passed after Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine prohibit anti-war dissent, with punishments including heavy prison sentences <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The dissent in St. Petersburg reflects wider political sentiments in Russia as public criticism of Putin's regime continues despite crackdowns on dissent. Municipal deputies from across Russia have expressed opposition, demanding Putin's resignation due to the damaging impact of his actions on Russia's future <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The deputies' appeals target not only liberal citizens but also those loyal to the authorities who are starting to doubt the success of the Russian army <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Their dissent, however, was met with charges of "discrediting" the Russian army, indicating the risks associated with public criticism of the regime <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. This growing dissent among elected representatives, despite the risk of severe repercussions, suggests increasing dissatisfaction with Putin's government in the midst of the Ukraine-Russia conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

We demand the resignation of Vladimir Putin from the post of president of the Russian Federation," states the petition, which has been circulated widely on social networks and been picked up by several media outlets. It is a striking show of opposition in a country where the Kremlins harsh crackdown on dissent has meant Putin is rarely denigrated publicly. Since the start of the conflict, those who criticise the president risk jail time due to a law that criminalises the publication of "fake news" on the Ukraine invasion.|

Another local deputy said 65 municipal representatives from St Petersburg, Moscow and several other regions had signed a petition she published on Monday calling for Putin's resignation. While posing no current threat to Putin's grip on power, the moves mark rare expressions of dissent by elected representatives at a time when Russians risk heavy prison sentences for "discrediting" the armed forces or spreading "deliberately false information" about them. Palyuga told Reuters before Tuesday's hearing that the group's appeals were aimed not only at liberal Russians but also at "people loyal to the authorities who are starting to have doubts when they see the lack of success of the Russian army".|

His aspirations and achievements, positive and negative, have been the subject of dozens of books and hundreds of articles, both scholarly and polemical. With his death on August 30, 2022, reflections and assessments of Gorbachevs pivotal historical role have divided public opinion both in the West and East. Largely applauded in the West and despised in his own country, Gorbachevs life, like that of Vladimir Lenin nearly a century before, fundamentally shaped the history not only of socialism but of capitalism, democracy, and the international security system well into the next century.|

After the invasion in February, Mr. Putin led the most intense crackdown on dissent since taking power two decades ago, signing a censorship law that made any criticism of the war effort or even calling it a war rather than a "special military operation" a potential crime. Thousands of journalists, activists and others fled the country, while just about all the prominent independent news media outlets still operating inside Russia were forced to shut down.|
