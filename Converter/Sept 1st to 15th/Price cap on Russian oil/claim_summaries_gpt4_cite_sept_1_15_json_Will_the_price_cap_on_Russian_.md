<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The price cap on Russian oil, pushed by the U.S. and G7 nations, aims to reduce Russian revenues and hinder its ability to fund its war, potentially forcing Russia to strike cheaper deals with its trading partners <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. However, for the measure to be effective, it would require wider international support, including key importing countries like India, and faces complexities such as determining the cap price and managing potential threats from Russia to cut off energy supplies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The G7 nations are implementing a price cap on Russian oil to reduce Russian revenues and limit their ability to fund war efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. For this measure to be successful, it would require wider international support, especially from major importing countries like India <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. If the cap forces Russia to make cheaper deals, it will still meet its objectives according to a senior US Treasury Department official <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

The G7 nations have proposed a price cap on Russian oil and petroleum products with the objective of cutting down Russian revenues and hampering the country's ability to finance its war in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The cap, if effectively imposed, could force Russia to strike cheaper deals with its trading partners, thus achieving its intended goals <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. However, this measure would require broader international support to be fruitful, including from major importers like India <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>There are concerns about the practicability of the cap, mainly regarding the level at which the cap is set and its enforcement <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. It is also unclear how effective a price-cap regime would be, particularly since some of Russia’s biggest buyers haven’t agreed to join <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> If the cap forces Russia to strike cheaper deals with trading partners by putting a ceiling on the price at which they can sell their products, it will still achieve its goals, a senior US Treasury Department official said on a call with reporters Friday.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-05-22/h_792e0a8e2f9d5ab91d578008d6355694" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 5th, 2022</div></div>| But the measure still needs work and will be extremely complex to manage. The price at which Russian oil will be capped still needs to be hashed out.It would also need wider international support to be effective. If the cap forces Russia to strike cheaper deals with trading partners by putting a ceiling on the price at which they can sell their products, it will still achieve its goals, a senior US Treasury Department official said on a call with reporters Friday. Shortly after the G7 announcement, Russian state energy giant Gazprom said itwould not resume deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipelineon Saturday as planned.|

"What China and India do is going to need to be a national decision for them," a senior US Treasury Department official said on a call with reporters Friday. But if the cap forces Russia to strike cheaper deals with trading partners by putting a ceiling on the price at which they can sell their products, it will still achieve its goals, the official added. Novak has called the proposals to impose restrictions "completely absurd" and said they could destroy the global oil market, TASS reported.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak has said Russia will refuse to sell oil to countries or companies that observe the cap.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/nation-world/g7-russia-oil-price-cap-20220902.html" target="_blank">inquirer.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 2nd, 2022</div></div>| The measure pushed by U.S. President Joe Biden could work because the service providers are mostly located in the European Union or the U.K. and thus within reach of sanctions. To be effective, however, it would have to involve as many importing countries as possible, in particular India where refiners have been snapping up cheap Russian oil shunned by Western traders. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak has said Russia will refuse to sell oil to countries or companies that observe the cap. The U.S. has already blocked Russian oil imports, which were small in any case.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Halting flows to Europe from Russia, the worlds second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the top natural gas exporter, would likely further roil global energy markets and leave the world economy facing even higher prices.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/analysis-putins-energy-gamble-may-prove-a-double-edged-sword-for-russia/" target="_blank">euractiv.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 8th, 2022</div></div>| President Vladimir Putins threat to completely cut off energy supplies to the West in a deepening confrontation over Ukraine could prove to be a double-edged sword for Russia. Just before the European Union announced a price cap on Russian gas on Wednesday (7 September), Putin threatened to sever supplies if such limits were imposed, warning the West it would freeze like the wolfs tail in a famous Russian fairy tale. Halting flows to Europe from Russia, the worlds second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the top natural gas exporter, would likely further roil global energy markets and leave the world economy facing even higher prices. Alexei Miller, chief executive of Russian state-controlled gas giant Gazprom, said in August that European gas prices could surge to $4,000 per thousand cubic metres, from around $2,200 seen on Wednesday.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> The price cap's goal is to reduce Russian revenues, weaken the country's ability to fund its war and Ukraine and also ease the impact of the war on global energy prices, the statement said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-02-22/h_5575752ce49534331660afd321225998" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Sep 2nd, 2022</div></div>| Finance ministers from the G7 nations released a joint statement announcing that they have agreed to implement a price cap on Russian oil and petroleum products in order to "reduce Russian revenues and Russia's ability to fund its war of aggression." "Today we confirm our joint political intention to finalise and implement a comprehensive prohibition of services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally the provision of such services would only be allowed if the oil and petroleum products are purchased at or below a price ("the price cap") determined by the broad coalition of countries adhering to and implementing the price cap," the statement reads. The price cap's goal is to reduce Russian revenues, weaken the country's ability to fund its war and Ukraine and also ease the impact of the war on global energy prices, the statement said. The measure builds on existing sanctions, particularly those in the sixth EU package, it added.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> But it remains unclear how effective a price-cap regime would be, particularly since some of Russias biggest buyers havent agreed to join.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/time-magazine-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://time.com/6210576/g7-russian-oil-price-cap/" target="_blank">Time Magazine</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 2nd, 2022</div></div>| To implement a cap, diplomats will have to convince European Union member nations to amend its sixth round of sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraineand that may still prove to be tough. That package, which prohibits the purchase of Russian oil starting Dec. 5, included a ban on the use by third countries of the blocs companies for oil-related insurance and financial services. But it remains unclear how effective a price-cap regime would be, particularly since some of Russias biggest buyers havent agreed to join. India is reluctant to formally join a price-cap scheme, since its industry worries it could lose out to other buyers on the chance to buy discounted Russian crude, according to people familiar with the views of Indian firms.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> How effective it is in practice will depend on the level of the cap and how it is enforced.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62770283" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The price cap helps achieve "our dual goals of putting downward pressure on global energy prices while denying Putin revenue to fund his brutal war in Ukraine", she said. The G7 agreement to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil is certainly symbolic. How effective it is in practice will depend on the level of the cap and how it is enforced. Energy prices have soared since Russia invaded Ukraine - and the revenues from oil sales have been helping to finance Vladimir Putin's aggression.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> There is pressure on Kyiv to demonstrate progress before winter sets in, amid threats by Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt all energy shipments to Europe if Brussels goes ahead with a proposal to cap the price of Russian oil exports.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/russia-gives-up-key-northeast-towns-as-ukrainian-forces-advance/" target="_blank">euractiv.com</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 11th, 2022</div></div>| If the reported gains are held, it would be a serious blow for Russia, which Western intelligence services say has suffered huge casualties. It would also be a big boost for Ukraine, which is keen to show Western nations supplying it with weapons it deserves their continued support. There is pressure on Kyiv to demonstrate progress before winter sets in, amid threats by Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt all energy shipments to Europe if Brussels goes ahead with a proposal to cap the price of Russian oil exports. Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in Kyiv that Ukrainian forces had demonstrated they were capable of defeating the Russian army with the weapons given to them.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Of course the gas prices from the other countries are more expensive than that of Russia, but Russia's current gas price is no longer cheap, since Russia intends to raise the price of her gas from 3,500 (the current top price) to 5,000 Euros per one thousand cubic meters by the end of 2022 ------ if Russia keeps selling gas to her western neighbors, that is.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/western-financial-sanctions-against-russia-less-effective-than-expected-by-jean-pisani-ferry-2022-08" target="_blank">project-syndicate.org</a></div><div></div><div>Sep 1st, 2022</div></div>| If the detente mentioned upstairs isn't the EU's cup of tea, then Russia's unfriendly EU countries can further diversify their buying sources of natural gas, by buying much more from other non-Russia countries, like Canada, the US, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Qatar, which all have rich gas supplies. Of course the gas prices from the other countries are more expensive than that of Russia, but Russia's current gas price is no longer cheap, since Russia intends to raise the price of her gas from 3,500 (the current top price) to 5,000 Euros per one thousand cubic meters by the end of 2022 ------ if Russia keeps selling gas to her western neighbors, that is. It's recently reported that Russia just starts to stop transmitting gas to the West through her Nord Stream 1 pipeline for an unlimited period of time.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> But in the medium term, the Western sanctions regime will make it impossible for Russia to sustain a modern economy and will probably constrain its ability to conduct war.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/foreign-policy-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/09/02/us-grand-strategy-ukraine-russia-china-geopolitics-superpower-conflict/" target="_blank">Foreign Policy</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 2nd, 2022</div></div>| Its embargo on Russian oilmuch easier to do than replacing the Kremlins gaswill come into effect only in December. Meanwhile, EU countries continue to transfer huge amounts of money for Russian energy. But in the medium term, the Western sanctions regime will make it impossible for Russia to sustain a modern economy and will probably constrain its ability to conduct war. What does this mean for U.S. grand strategy?|
