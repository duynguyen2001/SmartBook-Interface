In a rare display of dissent against the Russian government, several municipal deputies from Moscow and St. Petersburg have publicly called for the resignation of President Vladimir Putin. These calls, despite the risks they carry, were made in light of allegations of vote rigging and the advancement of Kyiv's forces in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Nikita Yuferev, a deputy, has remained consistent in his appeals for Putin's resignation, even after being fined and threatened with jail time for expressing his views <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Other deputies from the Smolninskoye municipality have also echoed these sentiments, appealing to the Russian Duma to impeach Putin for alleged acts of high treason, a move that has resulted in them being summoned by the St. Petersburg police for discrediting the ruling establishment <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The potential consequences for their dissent are severe, driven by Article 120 of the new Penal Code which criminalizes attempts to change the Constitution or the form of government.
