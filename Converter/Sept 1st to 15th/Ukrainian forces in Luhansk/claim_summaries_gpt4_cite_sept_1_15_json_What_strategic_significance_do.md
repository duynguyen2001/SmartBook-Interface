The city of Lysychansk, recently captured by Russian forces alongside the strategic city of Severdonetsk, is of particular strategic importance during the 2022 Ukraine-Russia crisis <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The city's takeover led to significant casualties on the Ukrainian side and further secured the territory encompassing the Lugansk Peoples Republic for Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. However, it's important to note that Ukrainian forces have made significant strides elsewhere, such as the recapture of Izium and Kupyansk, which were key hubs for the Russian military <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Despite the loss of Lysychansk, Ukraine's southern counteroffensive and plans to reclaim the Russian-occupied region of Kherson indicate a continued resistance against Russian advances <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
Lysychansk, located in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, holds strategic significance for both Ukrainian and Russian forces amid the 2022 Ukraine-Russia crisis. The city was the last in the Luhansk region to fall under Russian control in July after intense fighting <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. Being situated on the border of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the city provides a stronghold for Russian defenses against Ukrainian advances <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The city of Lysychansk was also targeted by Ukraine in a new offensive, signaling its strategic importance to the Ukrainian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>However, the Ukrainian forces' rapid advance led to a shift in the situation. There were reports of the occupiers, including both the military and collaborators, fleeing in haste from Lysychansk <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. This retreat indicates the city's strategic significance to the Russian forces and the potential setback their withdrawal could mean. The city's recapture by Ukrainian forces would be a significant gain, shifting the balance in the conflict and likely impacting the ability of Russian forces to maintain their hold on the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Kharkiv lies 30 miles from the Russian border, just above the strategically important Donbas area in eastern Ukraine where two pro-Russian, self-proclaimed "republics" are located, in Donetsk and Luhansk.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/ukraines-counterattack-around-kharkiv-inflicts-defeat-on-russia.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Sep 12th, 2022</div></div>| Instead, strategists now widely believe that Ukraine had planned to use the Russian redeployment of troops as an opportunity to redouble its efforts in the northeast of the country. Kharkiv matters Kharkiv lies 30 miles from the Russian border, just above the strategically important Donbas area in eastern Ukraine where two pro-Russian, self-proclaimed "republics" are located, in Donetsk and Luhansk. Despite this proximity, however, Moscow's forces have not been able to occupy the city since they started their unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.|

Arkin proclaims that Russia is losing though it had, at the time the article was published, just taken the strategic city of Severdonetsk, killing and capturing thousands of Ukrainian forces, and rendering thousands more combat ineffective since they had to abandon their equipment to flee for their lives. (Russia has since captured all of the territory encompassing the Lugansk Peoples Republic , including the city of Lysychansk, inflicting thousands of additional casualties on the Ukrainian military.) "The Russian armys so-called victory," Arkin proclaimed at the time, "is the latest installment in its humiliating military display and comes with a crushing human cost."|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> [i] Kyselivka is an operationally significant location for Russian forces around Kherson City because it is the last major settlement along both the E58 highway and a railway line between current Ukrainian positions and Chornobaivka, the outermost part of Kherson City.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-12" target="_blank">criticalthreats.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Ukraines southern counteroffensive is continuing to have significant impacts on Russian morale and military capabilities in southern Ukraine. Satellite imagery of known Russian positions in Kyselivka, 15km northwest of Kherson City, shows that all but four Russian vehicles have departed from previous forward positions, consistent with rumors that Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) troops have abandoned Kyselivka and moved back towards the Dnipro River. [i] Kyselivka is an operationally significant location for Russian forces around Kherson City because it is the last major settlement along both the E58 highway and a railway line between current Ukrainian positions and Chornobaivka, the outermost part of Kherson City. The apparent withdrawal of Russian troops from this position may compromise the Russians ability to defend the northwestern outskirts of Kherson City and suggests that Russian troops in this area perceive an imminent threat to their positions.|

In a big strategic win for Kyiv, both Izium and Kupyansk were recaptured. Izium, which sits near the border between the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, had been under Russian occupation for more than five months and had become an important hub for the invading military. Russia was using Izium as a launching pad for attacks southward into the Donetsk region and Kupyansk, some 30 miles to the north of Izium, as a rail hub to resupply its forces.|

Moreover, Kherson was a necessary stepping stone to Mykolaiv and then Odesathe jewel in the crown. Odesa is not only of huge cultural importance but of great economic and logistical worth as well. Russia changed its initial objectives and recognized that taking the whole coastline would ruin Ukraines economy since the ports are vital for the export of almost all of their produce.|

Sergiy Kudelia: This is the northern region of Kharkiv Oblast, right on the border with the Russian Federation. The significance of this portion is that it is right next to the second-largest city in Ukraine, Kharkiv, which has been shelled by the Russian military since February. So, the fact that the Ukrainians pushed the Russians out of this area is a major change in terms of the ability of the civilians in this city to live a normal life.|
