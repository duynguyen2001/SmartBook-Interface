While initially stating he has no immediate plans to contact Putin, Biden has indicated his preparedness to speak with the Russian leader if there is an indication that Putin is looking for a way to end the conflict (4). However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has suggested that Biden's precondition for talks, which includes Putin withdrawing from Ukraine, coupled with the U.S.'s non-recognition of annexed Ukrainian territories, makes such negotiations unlikely (5).",

Initially, Biden had not spoken to Putin since the conflict began nearly ten months ago, indicating a lack of direct engagement (6). However, his stance has evolved to express a willingness to speak with Putin if the Russian leader demonstrates a genuine interest in finding a way to end the war. Biden's conditional readiness for discussions is contingent upon Putin's readiness to seek an end to the conflict and would also involve consultation with NATO allies, particularly following the alignment expressed with French President Emmanuel Macron on supporting Ukraine (3,7). \n\nBiden's approach is marked by a clear demand that Putin must be looking for a way to \"pull out\" of Ukraine, which reflects the U.S. position that Russia must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and pre-war borders\u2014a stance that contrasts with the Kremlin's expectation that the U.S. recognize the annexed Ukrainian regions as part of Russia, which the U.S. does not (5,8). Despite the Kremlin's openness to negotiations under conditions that safeguard Russia's \"national interests,\" Biden's insistence on these territories being a sticking point makes the likelihood of talks complex (5,8). Thus, Biden's readiness to engage in dialogue with Putin is not without significant reservations and conditions, reflecting a nuanced and strategic approach to the possibility of negotiations within the broader framework of the conflict and international relations (2,4,6)."

This position is reinforced by the provision of robust direct budget support and urging international financial institutions to enhance their support for Ukraine. France and the US also emphasize the importance of holding Russia accountable for atrocities and war crimes, further indicating the high costs that Russia could continue to face if it persists with the conflict (5). Additionally, the US has expressed its readiness to engage in diplomacy, a sentiment echoed by French President Macron, who is open to speaking with Putin once Ukraine sets the conditions for a peace agreement (6). \n\nHowever, the Kremlin has indicated that the lack of recognition by Washington of the annexed Ukrainian regions as part of Russia complicates the possibility of any discussions (1). Putin's defense of his actions in Ukraine and assertion that the West's support for Kyiv negates the prospects of negotiations demonstrate a current unwillingness to consider diplomatic resolutions (3). The US's strategy, which echoes Cold War-era tactics, aims to impose exorbitant costs on Russia for its aggression, potentially forcing a reconsideration of its military strategy (9). The combined diplomatic pressure from the US and its allies, along with the consistent military, economic, and humanitarian support for Ukraine, contributes to a strategic environment where Russia may have to weigh the sustainability of its campaign against the escalating costs and international isolation (4,7,8)."

However, European leaders, such as France's Emmanuel Macron, have signaled a desire to prevent further escalation and address the economic repercussions of the war, which could lead to divergent approaches to Russia (7). These differences have the potential to strain transatlantic relations, as Russia seeks to exploit any perceived divisions within the alliance (3).\n\nNATO's strategy and cohesion could be impacted by these differing positions on dialogue with Russia. The alliance has been energized and expanded in response to Russian aggression, yet the Kremlin continues to challenge Western military and financial support for Ukraine, aiming to weaken the resolve of NATO members (2). The juxtaposition of U.S. interests with those of Ukraine and the varying degrees of risk tolerance among European nations could influence NATO's collective decision-making and ability to shape Ukraine's strategic choices (5). Furthermore, with Russia framing the conflict as part of a broader struggle against a Western-dominated world order (4), NATO's unity is crucial in countering the narrative and upholding a cohesive strategy against both military and information threats (8)."

The Archbishop of Canterbury also emphasized the need for long-term support for Ukraine, reinforcing the sentiment of Western leaders that any efforts towards peace must not be forced, aligning with the U.S. and French presidents' approach to a coordinated and supportive response (3).",

Biden has no immediate plans to contact Putin but remains open to dialogue if Putin exhibits a genuine interest in seeking peace, with the caveat that such discussions would involve input from the U.S.'s European partners, particularly France, as affirmed by his recent meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron (2,4,7).\n\nTo ensure coordination with NATO allies, U.S. officials are calling for unity among member nations, aiming to avoid escalations and provocative rhetoric that could undermine the collective response to Russian aggression (9). The transatlantic partnership is deemed crucial for confronting a spectrum of threats, including cyberwarfare and nuclear risks posed by Russia. The administration has received praise for its role in strengthening global alliances, which is key to presenting a unified front in response to the Ukraine crisis (6). Additionally, the Biden administration is conveying the importance of remaining aligned with Europe on broader challenges like climate change, energy transition, and pandemics, indicating that the collaboration on Ukraine could serve as a model for partnership on other global issues (10)."

This stance by the U.S. complicates the search for a resolution, given that Moscow insists on the permanent inclusion of these regions within Russian territory, while the U.S. demands a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine as a precondition for negotiations (2,3). The ongoing conflict, with no peace talks in sight and continued hostilities, particularly in places like Bakhmut, underscores the deadlock, exacerbated by the entrenched positions of both Kyiv and Moscow, with the former refusing to concede any territory (3,4). The impasse over the annexed regions, therefore, presents significant policy implications for the United States, as it may need to consider strategies to increase the costs for Russia to sustain the conflict, as suggested by international relations theory (4,5).",
                "more_detailed": "The United States' non-recognition of the Ukrainian regions annexed by Russia complicates potential diplomatic talks aimed at resolving the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov highlighted that the stance taken by Washington hinders the possibility of finding common ground for discussions between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin (1,2,4). Peskov pointed out that Biden's precondition for talks, which is the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, coupled with the US's non-acceptance of the annexation, makes the initiation of negotiations unlikely (2,4). \n\nThis diplomatic impasse is further entrenched as President Biden insists that the only rational way to end the war is for Russia to \"pull out\" of Ukraine, with no immediate plans for contact between the two leaders unless Putin expresses an interest in ending the conflict, something he has yet to do (6). Additionally, Biden's support for Ukraine's sovereignty and his stipulation that any negotiations must respect Ukraine's conditions and territorial integrity emphasizes the US's firm position against recognizing the annexation, aligning with international condemnation of Russia's actions (3,6,7). The US's stance reflects a broader strategy to increase the costs to Russia for its involvement in the conflict, as advised by international relations theorists like John Mearsheimer, and is likely to continue as part of the US policy response to the crisis (5)."

This move also reflects the broader geopolitical struggle, as the US and its allies seek to uphold international norms and reinforce the consequences of violating sovereignty, which are central to their interests in the region (1,2,4,5).",
                "summary": "The arguments against a peace that would leave Russia in control of some Ukrainian territory are tied to a broader international goal of providing negative reinforcement to deter aggression, reflecting a stance shared by the United States and Ukraine, among others (1). US interests in Ukraine, while aligned with Ukraine's sovereignty, are not identical to Ukraine's goals, and the US, along with European allies, has significant influence over the conflict due to their support in terms of weapons, financial, and humanitarian aid (3). President Biden's stance on the conflict, describing it as \"sick\" and advocating for Putin to \"pull out\" of Ukraine, underscores the US's commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty and indicates that talks with Russia would only occur if Putin shows a genuine interest in ending the war (4). Similarly, France's firm support for Ukraine, as expressed by President Macron, emphasizes the importance of upholding international principles for the stability of the global order, which aligns with US interests and the broader international community's stance against the Russian invasion (5).",
                "more_detailed": "The proposed Ukrainian law to ban religious organizations affiliated with Russia reflects the broader conflict's intricate dynamics and the emphasis on sovereignty and national security. The punitive aspect of deterring Russian aggression by reinforcing the norm against attacking sovereign nations is a shared goal of the United States and many other countries, as it seeks to prevent future territorial infringements (1). Moreover, the law is a manifestation of resisting cultural and ideological influence, echoing President Putin's own statements about Ukraine's alignment with Western values, which he opposes, and his critique of the West's acceptance of LGBTQ+ communities (6). This resistance to Russian influence aligns with US interests, which include upholding the foundational principles of the international order, such as territorial integrity and democracy, as well as the US's commitment to supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia's illegal war of aggression (9,10).\n\nThe US's interests, while aligned with Ukraine's, are not necessarily identical, and the complex interplay of domestic support and international law becomes apparent (3). The United States and its allies, such as France, have publicly condemned Russia's actions and pledged continued military, economic, and humanitarian support to Ukraine (4,5). This support is critical not only for Ukrainian sovereignty but also for the stability of the global order, underscoring the significance of adherence to international norms and laws (5,9). The proposed law and the broader conflict also have implications for US policy, as they necessitate a strategic approach to managing great-power rivalries and reinforcing alliances to deter future conflicts (2,9). Thus, the US's engagement in the conflict, while principled on democratic values and international law, is also a strategic endeavor to maintain global stability and deter aggression (1,9,10)."

                "cc_text": "The fact that Washington doesn't recognizeannexed Ukrainian regions as part of Russia would complicate possible talks betweenUS President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday. In September, Moscow illegally declared four Ukrainian regions to be Russian territory: Luhansk and Donetsk -- home to two Russian-backed breakaway republics where fighting has been ongoing since 2014 -- as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, two areas in southern Ukraine that had been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began. The illegal annexations followed sham referendums in these southern and eastern regions. Russian troops have since withdrawn from a swathe of the Kherson region, including the regional capital Kherson city. Here's some background: On Thursday, Biden told reporters during a joint White House news conference with French President Emmanual Macron that he \"has no immediate plans\" to contact Putin, but added that he's prepared to speak with the Russian leader if he's looking for a way to end the war in Ukraine. Biden also clarified that Putin has not done so yet. \"He's just miscalculated across the board,\" Biden said of Putin following his bilateral meeting in the Oval Office with the French president. \"And so the question is how does he get himself out of the circumstances in? I'm prepared, if he's willing to talk, to find out what he's willing to do, but I'll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I'm not going to do it on my own.\" Peskov said Moscow has always been open to negotiations to ensure its interests but Putin's initiative to discuss security guarantees with the US, NATO and the OSCE \"was not reciprocated.\" On Thursday,Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov echoed those remarks, saying thatMoscow \"never avoids contacts\" but there haven't been \"substantial ideas\" when it comes to a possible meeting betweenBidenand Putin.",

Separately, the Kremlin said on Thursday that any details of prisoner swap discussions with theUnited Stateswill not be publicly disclosed and that Moscow is not planning to engage with the Biden administration before the end of the year, according to Russian state media. New law would ban religious groups in Ukraine associated with Russia: Ukraine's parliament will vote on a new law that would ban the operation of religious organizations \"affiliated with centers of influence\" in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday, in an effort to prevent an \"opportunity to manipulate\" Ukrainians.

But this figure is much lower thanestimates suggested by the United States. Electricity supplies are being restored in Kherson: The southern Ukrainian city was left without power due to Russian shelling early Thursday, a local official said.

This special occasion reaffirms a relationship founded on more than two centuries of friendship, economic partnership, defense and security cooperation, and shared commitment to democratic principles, values, and institutions. France is the United States oldest ally, and while our relationship is rooted in history, it is oriented squarely toward the future. Building on their joint statement of October 29, 2021, the leaders outlined a shared vision to strengthen security and increase prosperity worldwide, combat climate change, build greater resilience to its effects, and advance democratic values. This vision is built on a shared conviction that the United States and its European allies and partners can better face our greatest challenges and capitalize on our most promising opportunities together. This includes addressing global issues such as climate change and energy transition, investing in technologies and building resilient value chains in strategic sectors such as health, semiconductors, and critical minerals, as well as strengthening our security and defense cooperation.\n\nTransatlantic, European and Global Security\n\nThe Presidents resolve to continue working tirelessly for a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace. This entails maintaining our nations collective defense and security, including through NATO; pursuing a more robust, integrated, and coherent approach to building national and collective resilience against military and non-military threats to our security; and promoting international stability in response to the full range of current threats. The Presidents recognize the importance of a stronger and more capable European defense that contributes positively to transatlantic and global security and is complementary to and interoperable with NATO. European-led missions and operations, such as in Bosnia and the training mission for Ukraine, are positively contributing to transatlantic security.\n\nThe Presidents commend the U.S.-France defense relationship and welcome the Statement of Intent signed on November 30, 2022, by the U.S. Secretary of Defense and French Minister of Armed Forces, which allows for increased interoperability and enhanced cooperation in the areas of space, cyberspace, intelligence, and countering malign influence. The Presidents intend to expand defense cooperation on advanced capabilities and key technologies that will be critical to deterrence and defense in the future.\n\nThey welcome progress made by the U.S.-France Defense Trade Strategic Dialogue in fostering shared views on defense market access and export issues. The United States and France intend to continue our cooperation to enhance the efficiency of the defense export authorization process, with a view to developing stronger and interoperable defense industrial bases in Europe and in the United States as a means to deliver better military capabilities for the benefit of the Alliance.\n\nUkraine\n\nThe Presidents strongly condemn Russias illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and stress that intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable. They also condemn and reject Russias illegal attempted annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, in clear violation of international law. The United States and France deplore Russias deliberate escalatory steps, notably its irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and its disinformation regarding alleged chemical attacks, and biological and nuclear weapons programs. They reaffirm their nations continued support for Ukraines defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, including the provision of political, security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to Ukraine for as long as it takes. This includes the provision of significant resources to support Ukrainian civilian resilience through the winter, including stepping up the delivery of air defense systems and equipment needed to repair Ukraines energy grid. The United States and France plan to continue working with partners and allies to coordinate assistance efforts, including at the international conference taking place in Paris on December 13, 2022. They also intend to continue providing robust direct budget support for Ukraine, and to urge the international financial institutions to scale up their financial support.\n\nThe United States and France reiterate their duty to uphold applicable international obligations and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. They also reiterate their steadfast resolve to hold Russia to account for widely documented atrocities and war crimes, committed both by its regular armed forces and by its proxies, including mercenary entities such as Vagner and others, through support for international accountability mechanisms, including the International Criminal Court, the Ukrainian prosecutor general, UN Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry, and the OSCE Moscow Mechanism, sanctions, and other means.\n\nThe United States and France remain committed to addressing the wider effects of Russias war, including working with the international community to build greater resilience to food and energy disruptions.\n\nIndo-Pacific\n\nThe United States and France, two nations of the Indo-Pacific, are strengthening their partnership in the Indo-Pacific region to advance prosperity, security, and shared values based on a rules-based international order, transparent governance, fair economic practices, and respect for international law, including freedom of navigation. The United States and France intend to expand their regional diplomatic, development, and economic engagement with a view to building resilience in the Pacific Islands. They also intend to increase practical coordination in the region on maritime security. The United States intends to increase its support and material contributions to air and maritime deployments conducted by France and other European nations in the region.\n\nThe United States and France will continue to coordinate on our concerns regarding Chinas challenge to the rules-based international order, including respect for human rights, and to work together with China on important global issues like climate change. The Presidents reaffirm the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Both leaders also strongly condemn the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas (DPRK) unprecedented number of unlawful ballistic missile tests this year that violate multiple UN Security Council resolutions and pose a threat to regional peace and stability, and are committed to continue coordination at the UN Security Council to address DPRK violations.\n\nAfrica\n\nThe Presidents renew their resolve to work with African partners to pursue shared governance, security, and economic priorities on the continent. They affirm the importance of African voices in multilateral fora, especially in addressing global crises like climate change, pandemic response and recovery, sustainable energy access, and food insecurity. They aim to support democratic institutions and civil societies in Africa to enhance accountability and the delivery of basic services.\n\nThey reaffirm their joint support for the African-led Great Green Wall initiative to address the climate and biodiversity crisis, contributing to sustainable development, peace, and security in the Sahara and Sahel regions. Fighting disinformation and terrorism remain joint priorities of France and the United States on the continent. France and the United States intend to continue to work closely with the African Union and African regional organizations to address the continents challenges and seize opportunities to increase trade and investment.\n\nMiddle East\n\nFrance and the United States are determined to work closely in support of peace and prosperity in the Middle East. The Presidents welcome the launch of the Negev Forum and the second anniversary of the signing of the Abraham Accords, along with the historic breakthrough of the October 2022 Israel-Lebanon maritime boundary agreement. They are determined to sustain joint efforts to urge Lebanons leaders to elect a president and advance critical reforms. They remain committed to maintain the means and capabilities necessary for the counterterrorism mission in Iraq and Syria as members of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. France and the United States continue to work to improve the grave humanitarian situation faced by the Syrian people as well as to promote a long-lasting, just solution to the Syrian conflict. They will continue engaging with partners in the Middle-East and follow up on the August 2021 Baghdad Conference.\n\nThe Presidents also express their respect for the Iranian people, in particular women and youth, who are bravely protesting to gain the freedom to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms, which Iran itself has subscribed to and is violating.\n\nThey remain determined to ensure that Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon. France and the United States continue to work with other international partners to address Irans nuclear escalation, its insufficient cooperation with the IAEA, including on serious and outstanding issues relating to Irans legal obligations under its Non-Proliferation Treaty Safeguards Agreement, and its destabilizing activities in the Middle East, most urgently its transfers of missiles and drones, including to non-state actors. These transfers can threaten key Gulf partners and stability and security in the region, contravene international law, and now contribute to Russias war of aggression against Ukraine. France and the United States will work with partners to enhance cooperation regarding enforcement of relevant UN Security Council resolutions and countering these activities. They will undertake joint efforts aimed at further strengthening the international framework constraining the proliferation of Iranian missile and unmanned aerial vehicle technologies in the region and beyond and in enhancing practical efforts to counter this proliferation.\n\nNuclear Deterrence, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament\n\nThe United States and France reaffirm that nuclear deterrence remains essential for their national security and a core component of NATOs overall capabilities for deterrence and defense. They reaffirm that the fundamental purpose of NATOs nuclear capability is to preserve peace, prevent coercion, and deter aggression against the Alliance. They reaffirm the importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and their opposition to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which does not reflect the increasingly challenging international security environment and is at odds with the existing non-proliferation and disarmament architecture. The United States and France also reaffirm support for their Mutual Defense Agreement and intend to expand their technical cooperation on a wide range of strategic risk reduction topics.\n\nEconomy, Emerging Technologies, Trade, and Supply Chains\n\nThe bilateral investment and trade relationship between our nations is longstanding and deep, creating significant jobs and prosperity for both. The United States and France reaffirm their commitment to an open and rules-based multilateral trading system, with a modernized WTO at its core. In that spirit, they continue to promote bilateral trade and investments that support supply chain resilience and our high-tech and innovative industries, including aerospace, information technology, pharmaceuticals, and finance. With a view to further enhancing their bilateral trade and investment relationship, they intend to hold discussions on reciprocal facilitation of visa issuance and renewal, and authorizations of stay.\n\nThe United States and France are committed to developing diverse and robust supply chains for critical minerals, including through their collaboration in the Mineral Security Partnership and the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. They reaffirm their shared goal of accelerating the global green energy transition. They look forward to the work of the U.S.-EU Taskforce on the Inflation Reduction Act to further strengthen the U.S.-EU partnership on clean energy and climate through mutually beneficial ways.\n\nSpace\n\nThe Presidents are committed to strengthening the U.S.-France alliance across all sectors of space cooperation. They highlight their engagement in continuing the longstanding bilateral cooperation in Earth observation for monitoring and assessing climate change and adapting to its consequences. In that spirit, they plan to working jointly on future Earth science missions. They welcome Frances commitment not to conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing and will work towards universal adherence to this pledge. The United States and France are determined to deepen collaboration on defense space activities, including military planning, information sharing, and operational coordination. They welcome the June 2022 signings of the Artemis Accords by France and of the Space for Climate Observatory Charter by the United States, as well as the first meeting of the U.S.-France Comprehensive Dialogue on Space in Paris in November 2022.\n\nEnergy\n\nThe Presidents welcome the successful first year of the U.S.-France Bilateral Clean Energy Partnership, which convened most recently in October 2022, as the high-level platform to advance our energy and climate cooperation. In reaffirming their joint determination to further synchronize and deepen cooperation on civil nuclear energy, the United States and France plan to set up a nuclear energy small group within the Partnerships framework. The Partnerships priorities also include deepening civilian nuclear cooperation and contributing to a reliable nuclear supply chain, in accordance with the highest standards of nuclear nonproliferation, including the application of IAEA Additional Protocol, and by further reducing reliance on civil nuclear and related goods from Russia. The Partnership will promote advanced nuclear power globally, which has a key role to play in order to reduce global CO2 emissions, while continuing efforts to limit the spread of sensitive enrichment and reprocessing technology.\n\nThe United States and France continue to promote energy policies, technology, and innovation that enhance renewable energy production and accelerated deployment. They intend to continue to support the diversification of Europes natural gas supply, including through U.S. liquified natural gas exports, as well as to cooperate in reducing overall demand for natural gas in alignment with climate objectives. The Presidents welcome the progress made through the U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security to diversify the EUs natural gas supplies, reducing its cost and limiting its dependence on natural gas.\n\nClimate and Biodiversity\n\nThe Presidents express their deep concern regarding the growing impact of climate change and nature loss and intend to continue to galvanize domestic and global action to address it. France and the United States plan to continue pursuing their efforts to support the phase out of coal as soon as possible, both domestically and in emerging economies. They plan to increase their support towards those countries that host the most critical reserves of irrecoverable carbon and important biodiversity. France and the United States will also work together to protect rainforests and to tackle deforestation and illegal forest clearances, including through the One Forest Summit that will be held early 2023 in Libreville. They will work together to ensure better ocean protection in view of the next UN Ocean Conference that will be held in France in 2025 and are fully mobilized at the highest level for the conclusion of the UN Treaty on the protection of the High Sea in 2023.\n\nStrengthening the International Financial Architecture\n\nFrance and the United States intend to work jointly to strengthen the international financial architecture to support the most vulnerable countries in a context of multiple shocks, from the COVID-19 pandemic to the repercussions of Russias war against Ukraine and the accelerating effects of climate change. The United States and France will also cooperate closely to reduce the financing gap in emerging and developing economies in order to foster sustainable pathways towards net zero. This includes working together to ensure that multilateral systems are delivering timely debt relief from all key creditors to countries in distress.\n\nAs two major shareholders, France and the United States reaffirm their determination to drive an evolution of the multilateral development banks, starting with the World Bank, to better address global challenges and support private investment in emerging and developing markets. France and the United States reiterate their commitment to help meet the global ambition of $100 billion U.S. dollars in voluntary contributions as soon as possible for countries most in need, including through the channeling of special drawing rights.\n\nThe Presidents affirm their willingness to cooperate to raise the level of ambition on these issues, including at the summit to be held in Paris in June 2023.\n\nGlobal Health and Food Security\n\nIt is fitting that this State Visit coincides with World AIDS Day, given our nations leadership in turning the tide of the AIDS pandemic and as the most recent hosts of the replenishments for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Learning from the COVID-19 pandemic, France and the United States plan to intensify their cooperation on global health security and pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, including by supporting the newly established Pandemic Fund, bolstering national health systems, training health workers, and strengthening multilateral institutions including the World Health Organization. The United States and France intend to continue working together to respond to regional and global food security challenges. They also intend to promote and safeguard an open and transparent agricultural market, to invest in resilient food systems, and to refrain from imposing any unnecessary trade obstacles.\n\nDemocracy and Human Rights\n\nThe Presidents recognize that strengthening democratic values and respect for universal human rights is essential to meeting the unprecedented challenges of our time. They reinforce the commitments they each made at the first Summit for Democracy to support free and independent media, tackle the proliferation of surveillance technologies and disinformation, bolster democratic reformers, and advance technology for democracy. The United States and France intend to strengthen and expand the Freedom Online Coalition, advance the commitments made in the Christchurch Call to Action to counter the dissemination of terrorist and violent extremist content online to better protect human rights both on- and off-line, and plan to promote the principles outlined in the Declaration for the Future of the Internet.\n\nCyber and Disinformation\n\nThe Presidents renew their determination to work alongside partners and stakeholders to advance cybersecurity and to uphold international law and established, non-binding global peacetime norms in cyberspace, including through the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace and through an ambitious United Nations Program of Action. The United States and France plan to hold their fifth U.S.-France Cyber Dialogue in early 2023. They also intend to strengthen bilateral coordination in combating foreign manipulation of information online. They reaffirm their support for independent media at the international level, including through the International Fund for Public Interest Media (IFPIM) to be hosted in Paris. The United States and France underscore the importance of last months Counter Ransomware Initiative Summit where they and 35 other participants reaffirmed their cooperation to disrupt ransomware globally. Recognizing the growing use of commercial space capabilities to support critical functions and the increasing cybersecurity threats to those capabilities, France and the United States intend to work together to strengthen the cybersecurity of these space systems.\n\nEducation and Science Partnerships\n\nThe United States and France are committed to deepening their educational cooperation with the shared objective of fostering greater equity and access to excellence in education. Because the power of language and international mobility can lead to meaningful partnerships, they intend to undertake new initiatives to foster language learning, such as facilitating French and English language teaching assistant exchanges between their respective countries. They welcome and support the French for All initiative, which promotes greater and more equitable access to French language education and the benefits of bilingualism for young learners across the United States.\n\nThe United States and France aim for a robust network of educational partnerships and exchange programs to reach the next generation of transatlantic leaders who will shape Franco-American relations for decades to come. This includes strengthening the flagship U.S.-French Fulbright Program, which will celebrate the 75th anniversary in 2023. They also intend to develop new ways for young French and Americans to learn about each others culture and history, including through Villa Albertines residency program for French and Francophone creators across the United States as well as for American creators across France. Likewise, they are creating the \"250 for 250\" program, which celebrates Frances role in the founding of the United States, and the enduring friendship between their two nations, by sending 250 French students to study or intern in the United States and 250 American students to study or intern in France.\n\nThrough technical and scientific exchange, the United States and France intend to deepen their collaboration on shared priorities such as health, the environment, and emerging technologies, including biotechnology, quantum science, and artificial intelligence.\n\nJoseph R.

They weren't shy to openly talk about it during the past years,\" Putin said, referring to the U.S. policy, as he attended a summit in Kyrgyzstan of a Moscow-dominated economic alliance of ex-Soviet nations.\n\nFor years, the Kremlin has expressed concern about U.S. efforts to develop the so-called Conventional Prompt Global Strike capability that envisions hitting an adversary's strategic targets with precision-guided conventional weapons anywhere in the world within one hour.\n\n\"Speaking about a disarming strike, maybe it's worth thinking about adopting the ideas developed by our U.S. counterparts, their ideas of ensuring their security,\" Putin said with a thin smile, noting that such a preemptive strike was intended to knock out command facilities.\n\nHe claimed that Russia already has commissioned hypersonic weapons capable of carrying out such a strike, while the U.S. hasn't yet deployed them. He also claimed that Russia now has cruise missiles that surpass their U.S. equivalents.\n\nWhile Putin appeared to refer to conventional precision-guided weapons when he talked about possibly mimicking the U.S. strategy, he specifically noted that the U.S. hasn't ruled out the first use of nuclear weapons.\n\n\"If the potential adversary believes that it can use the theory of a preemptive strike and we don't, it makes us think about the threats posed by such ideas in other countries' defensive posture,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Press",

                "cc_text": "Indonesian lawmakers unanimously passed a sweeping new Criminal Code on Tuesday that criminalizes sex outside marriage, as part of a tranche of changes that critics say threaten human rights and freedoms in the southeast Asian country.\n\nThe new code, which also applies to foreign residents and tourists, bans cohabitation before marriage, apostasy, and provides punishments for insulting the president or expressing views counter to the national ideology.\n\n\"All have agreed to ratify the (draft changes) into law,\" said lawmaker Bambang Wuryanto, who led the parliamentary commission in charge of revising the colonial-era code. \"The old code belongs to Dutch heritage and is no longer relevant.\"\n\nThe world's largest Muslim-majority nation, Indonesia has seen a rise in religious conservatism in recent years. Strict Islamic laws are already enforced in parts of the country, including the semi-autonomous Aceh province, where alcohol and gambling are banned. Public floggings also take place in the region for a range of offences including homosexuality and adultery.\n\nThe changes to the Criminal Code have not only alarmed human rights advocates, who warned of their potential to stifle personal freedoms, but also travel industry representatives who worried about their potential effect on tourism.\n\nIn a news conference Tuesday, Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Laoly said it wasn't easy for a multicultural and multi-ethnic country to make a Criminal Code that \"accommodates all interests.\"\n\nHe said he hoped that Indonesians understood that lawmakers had done everything they could to accommodate \"public aspiration,\" and invited dissatisfied parties to submit a judicial review to the constitutional court.\n\nIn the lead up to Tuesday's vote, rights groups and critics warned that the new code would \"disproportionately impact women\" and further curtail human rights and freedoms in the country of more than 270 million people.\n\n\"What we're witnessing is a huge setback to Indonesia's hard-won progress in protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms after the 1998 revolution. This Criminal Code should have never been passed in the first place,\" said Usman Hamid, executive director of Amnesty International Indonesia.\n\nWhat's in the Criminal Code?\n\nThe new Criminal Code runs to 200 pages and has been years in the making.\n\nA previous draft was set to be passed in 2019 but the vote was postponed after thousands of protesters, mostly students, took to the streets demanding the government withdraw it.\n\nIn a televised address at the time, President Joko Widodo said he would delay the vote after \"seriously considering feedback from different parties who feel objections on some substantial content of the Criminal Code.\"\n\nHamid from Amnesty noted there had been \"no meaningful changes\" enacted since 2019.\n\nUnder the version passed Tuesday, sex outside marriage carries a potential one-year prison term though there a restrictions on who can lodge a formal complaint. For example, the parents of children who are cohabitating before marriage have the authority to report them.\n\nAs well as introducing new offences, the code also expands on existing laws and punishments. Blasphemy laws have increased from \"one to six provisions\" and can now lead to a maximum five-year prison sentence, according to a draft document.\n\nHamid said laws on insulting the country's leaders and unsanctioned protests will have a \"chilling effect\" on free speech.\n\n\"The reinstatement of provisions banning insults to the president and vice president, the sitting government as well as state institutions would further create a palpable chilling effect on freedom of speech and criminalize legitimate criticisms,\" he said.\n\nHuman Rights Watch Indonesia Researcher Andreas Harsono said the laws are \"a setback for already declining religious freedom in Indonesia,\" warning they could be misused to target certain individuals.\n\n\"The danger of oppressive laws is not that they'll be broadly applied, it's that they provide avenue for selective enforcement,\" he said.\n\nHadi Rahmat Purnama, from the University of Indonesia's law faculty, said the laws would be implemented after a transitional period of three years.\n\nForeigners and tourists\n\nThe laws are expected to trouble the business community, especially those who regularly host and cater for foreign nationals and tourists.\n\nThe island of Bali, for example, relies heavily on tourist revenue and is still recovering from the pandemic slowdown that kept travellers away.\n\nPutu Winastra, chairman of the Association of the Indonesian Tour and Travel Agencies (ASITA) in Bali, told CNN the laws would \"make foreigners think twice\" about visiting Indonesia.\n\n\"From our point of view as tourism industry players, this law will be very troublesome,\" said Putu, who questioned how the laws would be policed.\n\n\"Should we ask (overseas unmarried couples) if they are married or not? Do tourist couples have to prove that they are married?\" he asked.",

                "cc_text": "Chisinau, Moldova and London CNN\n\nThe best day of Erics life came just days before the worst.\n\nAfter years of waiting, dozens of tests and a two-week stay on a psychiatric ward, Eric was finally getting his first testosterone shot. Eric is a 23-year-old transgender man from Ukraine. Assigned female at birth, he says starting hormone therapy was a major step in his quest to become his true self.\n\n\"It was utter happiness. I was euphoric, it was the moment that Ive been waiting for for so long,\" Eric, who asked for his last name to not be used because he is concerned for his safety, told CNN in Chisinau, Moldova, in July.\n\nBut just days after Eric had what should have been the first in a series of testosterone injections administered at a clinic in Kyiv, Russia invaded Ukraine. Everything changed.\n\n\"The clinic had closed because of the danger of airstrikes. I had the testosterone, but no way of getting [it administered]. I didnt have the needles and there were huge shortages of everything in pharmacies, even the most basic stuff, because obviously, during the war, theres a big need for things like syringes,\" Eric said.\n\nRussias brutal assault on Ukraine has upended the lives of millions of Ukrainians. But for Eric and many other trans people, the war has also made it much more difficult to be who they are.\n\nEric fled Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in late February, but has since returned. Ivana Kottasov/CNN\n\nMany lost access to vital medication and psychological help. Some were completely cut off from their communities and forced into spaces where LGBTQ people were not welcome, according to the Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe.\n\nBureaucratic problems, such as having personal documents issued under a different gender, can put them at extra risk.\n\nThe Ukrainian transgender rights group Cohort says it has helped more than 1,500 people since the start of the war, assisting them to move to safer areas and helping them pay their bills. The NGO also works with shelters to make sure they have the basic supplies they need.\n\nBut the number one request Cohort has been receiving in recent months is for help getting hormone therapy, or HRT, according to Anastasiia Yeva Domani, Cohorts co-founder and executive director.\n\nHRT can be used by trans women, trans men and non-binary people to make their physical appearance more aligned with their gender identity. The drugs alter the bodys testosterone or estrogen hormone levels and trigger physical changes that normally occur during puberty.\n\nAs with other medicines, Ukraines supplies of hormone drugs have been severely limited since the beginning of the war. Supply chains are often interrupted by fighting and buying from abroad is increasingly difficult because the collapse in the value of the Ukrainian currency has made imports a lot more expensive, Domani said.\n\n\"Some people started substituting for cheaper versions of the products, or they lower their dose to try to stretch [their supply] out. Very often, they dont speak to their endocrinologist about this, which is dangerous,\" she added.\n\nHormone therapies are typically prescribed in gradually increasing doses with careful monitoring until a stable hormone level is reached, according to Gendered Intelligence, a UK-based charity and grassroots organization supporting trans people. Different people may require different doses, because everyone responds differently to the therapy.\n\n\"Having a safe and stable hormone level is important because hormones govern a wide range of bodily functions, from brain activity to bone development,\" Cleo Madeleine, the spokesperson for Gendered Intelligence, told CNN.\n\nAnastasiia Yeva Domani is the co-founder of Cohort, a Ukrainian trans rights group. Kateryna Kryuchkova\n\n\"If a trans person is forced to lower their dose below the prescribed amount because of medicine shortages or disruption to supply lines as we have seen in Ukraine it could cause mood instability, aggravate gender dysphoria, and even lead to more serious health issues.\"\n\nThe situation in Ukraine has become so desperate, Domani said, that some people, rather than face the potential effects of withdrawal, have turned to self-medicating with homemade substitutes.\n\n\"There are people who have been making their own HRT at home and they sell it through Telegram channels and things like that,\" she said. \"They are definitely not safe.\"\n\nBuying cheaper drugs online can also be extremely risky.\n\n\"We strongly discourage self-medication with irregularly sourced drug treatments. Internet sourced hormone therapies can be dangerous and are sometimes contaminated,\" the UKs National Health Service (NHS) warns.\n\nEric fled Ukraine shortly after the beginning of the war. \"I thought I was going to die there. The alarms, the explosions all the time, the sirens were going off 20 times a day, I was afraid for my life,\" he said.\n\nWith his passport still under the name he was given at birth, Eric was allowed to cross the border into Moldova, where he was safe from Russian bombs. Ukraines government barred most men of fighting age from leaving the country soon after the war broke out.\n\nAt first, Eric was able to find a doctor who administered the shots he brought with him from Ukraine. But once he ran out of those, he was left without medication.\n\nSome of the effects of the earlier treatment started to reverse for example, his menstrual cycle came back after stopping earlier in the process and he experienced mood swings, he said. Worn out by stress and uncertainty, and traumatized by the war, he became emotionally numb, he said.\n\nAn active movement\n\nWhile still lagging behind many western European countries, Ukraine has taken steps in recent years to become more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, for example by adopting broad anti-discriminatory laws. This is partly because of Kyivs desire to join the European Union, which requires future member states to adopt laws protecting minorities.\n\nBut several people have also told CNN that Russias assault on Ukraine has prompted an even greater push for equality and inclusion, because Ukrainians realized their values were also under attack.\n\nThe Russian government has become increasingly homophobic under President Vladimir Putin. In 2013, it passed a law banning \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations\" among minors, which the European Court of Human Rights ruled to be discriminatory and in violation of human rights.\n\nIn November, the Russian parliament expanded the law to ban all Russians from promoting or \"praising\" homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are \"normal.\" According to Human Rights Watch, the new law would also \"isolate children from any information on alternative sexual orientation and gender identity, including gender transition.\"\n\nPutin has made no secret of the fact that his assault on Ukraine was partly motivated by Kyivs desire to align itself more closely with the Western world and its values. Alluding to Western acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, he accused the West of \"imposing attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature.\" The top priest of the Russian Orthodox Church and Putins close ally Patriarch Kirill went as far as suggesting gay pride parades were part of the reason for the war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile trans Ukrainians still experience negative attitudes in some spaces, for example in shelters housing families, according to COHORT, the discriminatory Russian rhetoric has pushed more Ukrainians to speak up.\n\nArtur Ozerov said the war has caused a shift in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people in Ukraine. Courtesy Artur Ozerov\n\n\"Never before would we get 25,000 signatures on a petition to support same sex marriage and have the president saying he is working on legalizing civil partnerships, including same sex partnerships,\" Domani said. \"The Istanbul Convention was ratified in July, which is something the LGBTQ+ community has been really hoping for for a long time,\" she said referring to the international treaty to protect women against violence.\n\nCivil servant Arthur Ozerov told CNN he experienced this shift in attitudes first hand when he decided to come out as an LGBTQ+ person and an occasional drag queen earlier this year.\n\n\"I was pleasantly surprised. I didnt have any problems at all. My colleagues at work, even those who used to be homophobic, treated me well,\" he said.\n\n\"The attitude of Ukrainians towards LGBTQ+ people has changed dramatically since the beginning of the war, there is an active movement now regarding their rights and freedoms,\" he added.\n\nOzerov said he believed this was partly because like himself, many people have come out as LGBTQ+ while being directly involved in the war effort, from fighting on the front lines to volunteering encompassing anything from helping distribute supplies to making petrol bombs and rebuilding and helping the people worst impacted by the war. Ozerov himself wears a uniform when working with the military in his capacity as a civil servant.\n\nBut there is another reason for the more liberal attitudes, he said.\n\nBeing under attack from Russia, which ostracizes the LGBTQ+ community with its laws, has made many Ukrainians realize they want to support European values that promote inclusion and equality, he said.\n\nFleeing the war\n\nMore than 7.8 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in late February, according to the United Nations. Of those, more than 4.7 million have registered for temporary protection in countries across Europe.\n\nFor most, the decision on whether and where to go was informed by friends and family, their financial situation and the ability to travel. But for people from LGBTQ+ communities, theres a whole other set of concerns.\n\nThe rights of trans people are weaker in some European Union countries than they are in Ukraine. For example, the Czech Republic, Finland, Latvia, Hungary and Romania still require trans people to undergo sterilization if they want to change their gender despite a 2017 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which found such laws violate Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. A bill seeking to overturn the requirement is currently making its way through the parliament in Finland.\n\nPoland and Hungary, two countries that border Ukraine and have seen a large influx of refugees, have both seen a pushback against LGBTQ rights in recent years so much so that the European Commission launched legal action against them over the issue in July 2021.\n\nAnd in some European countries, getting access to HRT can be a more complicated and lengthy process than in Ukraine, because local laws might require longer assessments before treatment starts, according to data compiled by Transgender Europe, a network of more than 200 trans rights groups.\n\nThat was part of the reason why, when Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Edward Reese was initially determined to stay put.\n\n\"I didnt want to leave because I had my top surgery planned in Kyiv in March,\" Reese, who identifies as trans masculine and works for KyivPride, told CNN, referring to the procedure to change the appearance of his chest, in this case through removal of breast tissue.\n\nReese has been very open about the transition process, documenting it on his blog and TikTok. He was doing it to raise funds for the surgery, but also to raise awareness of the problems trans people face in Ukraine.\n\n\"I wanted to show other trans masculine folks how to do it in Ukraine, so I documented all the steps that I went through in my blog,\" Reese said.\n\nBut shortly after the invasion, Reeses doctor left the country. The surgery was off.\n\nEdward Reese, right, attends Stockholm Pride in August 2022. Olha Androsova\n\nAlthough Reese didnt want to leave Ukraine, he was forced to start looking into other options in order to still have his operation in March. He left for Copenhagen, Denmark that month.\n\nTrans people have gained more rights in Denmark in recent years; the country allows legal gender change based on self-identification and in 2016 removed identifying as transgender from its official list of mental disorders. But waiting times for gender-affirming health care can be very long, Reese said.\n\n\"In Ukraine, before the war, you could buy the medication really easily. You have to go through psychiatric evaluation, but it only takes two weeks up to a month,\" Reese said. \"Its much harder in all European countries that I am aware of.\"\n\nAccording to a report by Transgender Europe, waiting times for an initial appointment with a specialist can stretch to years in several European Union countries, including Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\nReese said he contemplated trying to get hormones via unofficial channels, including online, but decided that this was too dangerous.\n\n\"I decided to [stop the medicine] because I have been just starting. So its not a big return for me. When a person is a year or two on hormones, its definitely much harder,\" Reese said. He had been taking hormones for three months.\n\nWhile willing to pause the hormonal therapy, Reese was not prepared to compromise on the operation.\n\n\"When I came here, I talked to trans people and they told me about this crazy long process of transitioning and said that Danish trans masculine people go for their surgeries to Malm in Sweden. There is a private clinic, where you dont have to wait. You just pay money, and you do what you want to do, and they dont ask you a million questions,\" Reese said. He had the surgery there, recovered and has returned to Ukraine in October.\n\nDrawing on his own experience, Reese has started an online support group for trans and non-binary Ukrainians who have found themselves cut off from their communities. \"Many trans people who are underage or students, they have to stay with their parents. For example, the family is gathering together to go to another country or to another city or something like this, they might be students who had to return from their dormitories to home and their parents are transphobic. I want to provide a nice cozy atmosphere for them,\" Reese said.\n\nIts all that matters\n\nGetting connected to advocacy groups or online communities can become vital for trans people fleeing conflict.\n\nAnastasiia Danilova, the executive director of GENDERDOC-M, the only LGBT rights advocacy organization in Moldova, said that when the situation in Ukraine started to deteriorate in late February, her group started to think about the help trans refugees might need.\n\n\"People are fleeing a war, thats already huge stress, its already tough and then there is additional trauma, additional pressure, aggression or stress due to their identities of not being accepted in common shelters, for example,\" she said.\n\nMore than 697,000 people have been recorded as crossing into Moldova from Ukraine since the beginning of the war. According to the UN, about 96,000 are registered as refugees there. GENDERDOC-M wanted to make sure everyone felt welcome. The group launched a hotline for LGBTQ+ Ukrainians and opened an LGBTQ+ friendly shelter.\n\n\"When people came, we provided them with accommodation, meals, medical, psychological, legal support and are working with our partner organizations in Ukraine,\" Danilova said, adding that, as of November, the group had helped about 200 LGBTQ people from Ukraine.\n\nIt was GENDERDOC-M that eventually helped Eric secure the drugs he needed to resume his transition. It also provided a place for him to find new friends and be himself.\n\n\"I wanted to resume my transition at all costs. lts my life, its all that matters,\" he said. \"It was life-saving for me.\"\n\nSince his return to Ukraine in early October, Eric has kept busy volunteering at a humanitarian hub run by an LGBTQ organization and at a soup kitchen that provides free meals for the elderly. He has also continued with his transition.\n\n\"I could always use some more hair in the beard department, but otherwise its going pretty good,\" he told CNN.",

Biden Jr. will announce this week that the United States will commit $55 billion to Africa over the next three years and appoint Ambassador Johnnie Carson as special representative for U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit implementation.\n\n\"Working closely with Congress, the U.S. will commit $55 billion to Africa over the course of the next three years across a wide range of sectors to tackle the core challenges of our time,\" Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House on Monday while previewing the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit starting on Tuesday and ending on Thursday. \"These commitments build on the United States longstanding leadership and partnership in develop- development, economic growth, health, and security in Africa over the past three decades.\"\n\nSullivan also announced that the State Department plans to appoint Ambassador Johnnie Carson as special representative for U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit implementation, noting that he \"is very well known to people across the continent of Africa.\"\n\n\"He brings a wealth of experience to the position, having dedicated his 37-year career to diplomacy in Africa, and we are looking forward to working with him to ensure that the announcements that get made over the next three days are translated into durable actions that last well beyond the summit,\" added Sullivan.\n\nAccording to Sullivan, the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, a three-day summit hosted by President Biden, \"is rooted in the recognition that Africa is a key geopolitical player. The continent will shape the future not just of the African people but also the world.\"\n\n\"President Biden believes that U.S. collaboration with African leaders, as well as with civil society and business leaders and the diaspora, women, youth, is essential to unlocking the potential of this decisive decade,\" he said.\n\nBelow is a broad summary of U.S. government statements on the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit starting today, December 13, 2022\n\nRemarks\n\nAntony J. Blinken, Secretary of State\n\nBenjamin Franklin Room\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Good evening, everyone. So I am here to tell you that we have another 10 speakers, and so we can (laughter).\n\nWe are so thrilled to have you here at the State Department.\n\nNow, I have not heard or seen this room this animated in the two years that Ive been here. So theres something in the water. (Applause.)\n\nBy the way, youre in the Ben Franklin Room. You can see Ben looking down on us over there. He was Americas very first diplomat. He signed our first treaty. He charted the Gulf Stream. He pioneered electricity. He gave us our ethos of self-government. And none of this did he do while sober. (Laughter.) So please feel inspired. (Applause.)\n\nLet me begin by thanking our extraordinary emcee for this evening, Yvonne Orji. Yvonne, thank you. (Applause.) Nothing makes you more insecure (laughter) than having to follow Yvonne on stage.\n\nYvonne once wrote that, \"Nigeria made me. America raised me.\" We often say that one of Americas greatest strengths is our diversity there are few greater testaments to that than the immense contributions of the African diaspora community, which is clearly out in force tonight. It is great to have you here.\n\nThere are so many other folks here Id like to thank this evening: Dorothy McAuliffe and our incredible Office of Global Partnerships; the entire Prosper Africa Initiative team; our co-sponsors Tony, thank you so much for everything youve done; Google, James; an incredible cast of friends, partners.\n\nNow, Im a native New Yorker. So my mayor is here. (Applause.) I dont know if Mayor Bowser is here. I dont know from Washington. But Ive also spent a lot of time as a resident of the District of Columbia another great mayor. Mayor Bowser, I think, was with us tonight. And I really want to thank the judges of our pitch competition, including Idris Elba. Idris, you here? Youre here somewhere was here.\n\nAnd to the remarkable competitors, know this: if you can survive a pitch competition with Stringer Bell, you can survive anything. (Laughter.)\n\nSo it is fitting that we are kicking off a week focused on deepening our ties with African countries and people with this inspiring group innovators, entrepreneurs, young people.\n\nEarlier this year in South Africa, I had an opportunity to set out our administrations strategy for the region. And at its core, the strategy can be distilled in one word. Youve already heard it spoken tonight: partnership.\n\nIts rooted in the recognition that the United States and African nations cant deliver on any of our fundamental needs and aspirations for our people, and we cant solve any of the really big challenges we face, if we dont work together. So its about what we can do with African nations and people not for them.\n\nOur strategy reflects the regions diversity, its influence, and as we can see tonight the ingenuity of its young people.\n\nYou all know this. Those youth are a growing part of the continents population and also the worlds. Today, more than 60 percent of Africas population is under the age of 25. By 2030, two in every five people on this planet will be African. These rising generations are powering dynamic economic growth in their countries and far beyond. 2016 just a few years ago African startups raised $350 million dollars in investment; last year, they raised $5 billion in investment and thats a curve thats going to keep going up and up and up. (Applause.)\n\nNow, its one thing to rattle off statistics; its another thing to meet these changemakers, as Ive had the chance to do as Secretary, from Dakar to Johannesburg, from Nairobi to Kinshasa.\n\nMuch like the founders who took part in tonights pitch competition, these entrepreneurs are not just running successful businesses. Theyre actually solving some of our most vexing problems, like closing enduring gaps in health care, helping entrepreneurs break into the formal economy.\n\nWe have a huge stake in the success of African innovators. Because when they are empowered to reach their full potential its good for the region, its good for the continent, its good for the world, its good for America.\n\nIdris said it best: Africa doesnt need aid, it needs innovation.\n\nSo tonight, let me just very quickly go through three ways our administration is working to broaden and deepen those partnerships to foster African innovation.\n\nFirst, were investing in the infrastructure that provides the foundation for African entrepreneurship. That means creating more pathways for the free flow of ideas, of information, of investment, which in the 21st century requires one thing: digital connectivity.\n\nLet me give you one example. Africa has around twice as many internet users as the United States, yet the continent has only a fraction of our data center space. What does that mean? Slower, less reliable connectivity. Thats why our U.S. Development Finance Corporation is investing $300 million in building data centers across the continent because we need networks that can keep up with the lightning pace of new ideas.\n\nSecond, were investing in rising leaders. Since President Obama created the Young African Leaders Initiative, nearly 5,800 trailblazers from every country in Sub-Saharan Africa have come to the United States for academic and leadership training developing skills, relationships that are going to last them a lifetime, to the benefit of their communities but also ours.\n\nMany of the Mandela Washington Fellows are entrepreneurs, including alum Abel Hailegiorgis from Ethiopia, whos here tonight. Abels company is building bicycles and wheelchairs from bamboo, which is stronger than steel there you are right there sustaining our planet, supporting local farmers and local manufacturers.\n\nThats not all. In September, the U.S. African Development Foundation teamed up with the Tony Elumelu Foundation to create a new program to provide financing, technical assistance, and mentorship to emerging innovators in Africa. We recently launched another initiative to connect up-and-coming climate entrepreneurs with American companies.\n\nThird, we are fostering greater engagement by American companies. Youre going to hear more about that throughout this week. The U.S. private sector already invests more than $4 in Africa for every dollar that our government allocates to the region in foreign assistance and it wants to do more. Thats the objective of our Office of Global Partnerships, which will take a U.S. private sector delegation to Ghana in February. Its the goal of the Prosper Africa initiative which is marshalling agencies from across our government to help more U.S. companies and inventors investors, excuse me, do business in Africa, and do it in a way that promotes inclusive growth growth thats sustainable for our planet.\n\nSo tonight were joined by Prosper Africas institutional investor delegation. It manages more than a trillion dollars in savings for American workers and retirees. The delegation recently helped a group U.S. of U.S. pension funds, including those of teachers from Chicago, city workers from Hartford and Philadelphia, invest more than $85 million in an African fund that will provide financing to small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nOne more bite-sized example. Several of the items on the menu prepared tonight by Chef Pierre were made using a grain called fonio. Farmed primarily in the Sahel, its what your mom cooked for you when you were growing up. (Applause.) So through a partnership with Prosper Africa, Pierres company Yoll is distributing fonio and other products made by small farmers in the region to markets here in the United States including at the Whole Foods thats just a few blocks from where we are this evening. In a region where its getting harder to grow crops due to a warming climate, fonios deep roots make it virtually drought-resistant. Now, in West Africa, its also said that \"Fonio never embarrasses the cook,\" which is good news if like me youre no Pierre in the kitchen. (Laughter.)\n\nSo thank you all for being here tonight. Thank you. Thank you for helping us kick off an incredible week. And more importantly, thank you for all youre doing working with us to deepen Americas partnerships with African nations partnership that has shaped our past, is shaping our present, and will will shape our future.\n\nHave a wonderful evening. Have a wonderful week. Thank you all very much. (Applause.)\n\nDeputy Administrator Isobel Coleman at a Side Event on Nutrition Investment in Africa\n\nOn December 13-15, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power will attend the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit and reinforce the Biden-Harris Administrations commitment to revitalizing global partnerships and alliances. Administrator Power will highlight U.S. collaboration with Africa on the most pressing global challenges and opportunities, including catalyzing private sector partnerships, food security, supporting emerging democracies, and climate adaptation.\n\nOn Tuesday, December 13, Administrator Power will host the opening session of the Civil Society Forum. In the afternoon, Administrator Power participates in summit sessions at the Washington Convention Center, including the \"Peace, Security and Governance Forum\" and \"Supporting Conservation, Climate Adaptation, and a Just Energy Transition Session.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, December 14, Administrator Power will hold bilateral meetings and attend U.S.-Africa Leader Summit events and discussions.\n\nOn Thursday, December 15, Administrator Power will attend Summit sessions at the Washington Convention Center.\n\nDepartment Press Briefing\n\nNed Price, Department Spokesperson\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\n[Excerpted ]\n\nMR PRICE: All right. So we have one thing at the top, and then I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nThis morning, Secretary Blinken, Administrator Power, and White House Gender Policy Council Director Klein announced the release of the updated 2022 United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally. The updated strategy will direct an inclusive, locally led, and survivor-centered approach to prevent and respond to genderbased violence through U.S. foreign policy and assistance.\n\nA few key elements in the updated strategy are the intersectional and inclusive approaches to gender-based violence; the reinforcement of our commitment to doing this work in a survivor-centered, trauma-informed manner; and the integration of gender-based violence prevention and response as a strategic priority across our foreign policy goals.\n\nWe are grateful for the investment of time of over 450 individuals across 200 organizations who share their expertise to ensure this updated strategy to prevent and respond to gender-based violence is comprehensive and cemented in our U.S. foreign policy.\n\nWith that, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Hi, Ned. I would like to move on to the U.S.-Africa summit actually, to the margins of that summit. There are many leaders invited, including the ones from Rwanda and the DRC this against a backdrop of renewed fighting in the eastern Congo and pressure on Rwanda and its support of the presumably support of the M23 rebels. I was just wondering if the Secretary would seize the opportunity that he has here with the two leaders being here or going to be here to maybe get them together, broker some sort of discussion, and because the obviously the opportunity is right in front of him.\n\nMR PRICE: Yeah, there are a number of opportunities that the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit will present in the coming days. Some of them have to do with peace and security on the continent. That, of course, will be a topic of discussion in many different fora over the next few days. As you know, this is a conflict and a set of tensions that Secretary Blinken has become personally invested in traveled to Rwanda and the DRC in August as tensions were flaring in an effort to engage the leaders of both countries, to urge a de-escalation and to urge steps that would put an end to these hostilities.\n\nHes continued to be personally engaged with counterparts in both countries, this week, of course, and weve continued to see levels of violence that are of concern. We remain deeply concerned by developments in the eastern DRC, particularly the renewed M23/FARDC hostilities. These hostilities really resumed in earnest in October and theyve continued since. Weve been deeply troubled by reports of killings of civilian areas under M23 control.\n\nWe just as we did when we were in the region, as weve done since that travel, weve urged all armed groups to cease hostilities. Weve called for a swift and thorough investigation of and accountability for those responsible for these reports of atrocities. And we support the Africanled mediation efforts to address the regional tensions in eastern DRC. The East African Community, Kenya, Angola have played an important role in all of this. We spoke to that role when we were in the region in the late summer, but all three have continued to engage with Rwanda and the DRC.\n\nWe urge implementation of the commitments that came forward after the November meeting in Luanda. There was a communique that was put forward following that meeting. Those commitments include a cessation of hostilities, the M23s withdrawal, and an end to state sponsor to armed groups, as well as condemnation of hate speech and the resumption of consultations between the DRC Government and domestic armed groups through that Nairobi process. So we continue to urge the DRC and Rwanda to work with one another, to work constructively with their neighbors, namely Kenya, Angola, and through the East African Community, to fulfill those commitments that were put forward.\n\nQUESTION: But there will be no three-way meeting or anything like that (inaudible)?\n\nMR PRICE: I couldnt speak at this point to any meetings that may be on the schedule, but I can assure you that tensions in the eastern DRC will be on the agenda.\n\nQUESTION: Can we stay on the Africa summit?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Im wondering if Secretary Blinken in his meetings will raise any concerns about Chinese lending and investment in the region, and if yes, what will be the message, basically.\n\nMR PRICE: Humeyra, youve traveled with us and heard us long enough to know that we tend not to speak in relation to any other country. We tend to have conversations with countries that are about the United States and what we can do, and, in some cases, what our comparative advantage is. In the Africa strategy speech that the Secretary laid out to the continent and to the world when we were in South Africa several months ago, the Secretary made the point that the United States is ready, willing, and able to be the partner of first resort for the countries across the continent.\n\nWe recognize the vibrancy, the energy, the opportunity that is presented on the continent, and thats not opportunity for us; it is opportunity for the countries of Africa to achieve with us. And that is really what we mean when we say partnership. We are not looking for a relationship that is transactional, thats extractive, that is burdensome, or leaves country in a leaves various countries in a more fragile, poorer state after a deal is signed.\n\nQUESTION: Is that a characterization for how you guys see Chinese investment in the region?\n\nMR PRICE: It is a characterization of what were not looking for. What were looking for is true, genuine partnership with the countries of Africa, a partnership that will allow us to unlock the potential, whether its through trade and investment, whether its through people-to-people ties, whether its through deepening diplomatic initiatives to advance our interests and the interests of the countries on the continent.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, but its no doubt that China has expanded its footprint in that across that continent. So, I mean, let me ask it differently: Is this like a I mean, do you see this as an opportunity for the U.S. to deepen its ties with the countries there?\n\nMR PRICE: Of course. Of course. This is this is what the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit is all about. At the first U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in 2014, we invited heads of state and government to come to Washington to begin this conversation as a continent. Now some eight years later, this is another important opportunity for Africa to come to the United States as a continent to discuss areas where individual countries bilaterally, groupings of countries multilaterally, or the continent itself, whether through the AU or other ad hoc groupings, can work closely with the United States.\n\nWe want to use the summit to deepen that partnership. We think weve made good headway over the course of the past few years during this administration, but theres nothing like face-to-face diplomacy; theres nothing like having the relevant leaders from across the continent in the United States for these discussions.\n\nQUESTION: The administration has stated support for African Union membership in the G20. Do you have any background on that? Why now? Is it because of the summit here in Washington, or is there more can you talk to a little bit more on that?\n\nMR PRICE: So this is something that the President will speak to during the course of the Africa Leaders Summit, but we believe, in short, that its past time for Africa to have a permanent seat at the table in international organizations and initiatives. We need more African voices in international conversation, including conversations that pertain to the global economy, democracy and governments governance, climate change, global health essentially every transnational challenge and opportunity that we face.\n\nAnd the President in making the statement is going to be following through on his commitments and listening to our African partners regarding what it is that they want and what they seek. This announcement builds on the strategy that Secretary Blinken laid out in South Africa over the summer. It also responds to requests from the AU president and South Africa, the only African G20 member at the present.\n\nYes.\n\n[End Excerpt ]\n\nFor full text of this briefing, please follow this link.\n\nUnited States Agency for International Development\n\nRemarks\n\nDecemer 12, 2022\n\nDEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR COLEMAN: Good evening, everyone. Its wonderful to be with you today as we mark the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit and the 2022 Africa Year of Nutrition. It is a privilege to represent USAID as we work together on an ambitious yet achievable goal to end hunger once and for all. It is because of the leadership of many in this room the NGO and donor communities, civil society and country partners, our allies and supporters in both houses of Congress that the United States was able to pass the Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act.\n\nThis landmark, bipartisan legislation codifies USAIDs commitment to prevent and treat malnutrition, with a focus on evidence-based interventions across health and food systems in development and humanitarian settings. Passage of this legislation could not have come at a more pivotal moment, as we face a global malnutrition crisis driven by a confluence of events, including the global pandemic, climate change, protracted humanitarian crises, and Russias unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine. The most severe impacts of this crisis have hit the Horn of Africa and the Sahel. This year, more than a million people were displaced in Somalia alone due to drought-induced hunger.\n\nAs this group knows, malnutrition drives nearly half of deaths among children under five around the world. But with sufficient, targeted resources and simple, evidence-based investments, this crisis is not only treatable, it is preventable. USAIDs approach to tackling malnutrition is grounded in ramping up nutrition commitments across Africa, including through our Feed the Future investments in enhancing the production, affordability, and marketing of safe and nutritious foods that reduce malnutrition and improve diet quality. Last year alone, USAID supported nutrition programming that reached over 25 million children with nutrition-specific interventions in 21 African countries.\n\nAt the 2021 Nutrition for Growth Summit, Administrator Power announced our intention to invest $11 billion in nutrition over the next three years and made important policy commitments focused on exclusive breastfeeding, nutrition data systems, and wasting treatment and prevention. We were thrilled to see governments across Africa as well as the African Union and the African Development Bank, making their own substantial policy and financial commitments.\n\nWhile we celebrate the success of Nutrition for Growth, we also recognize that the challenges to global nutrition, particularly in Africa, have grown even greater. We remain particularly concerned about the unprecedented number of children experiencing wasting. According to UNICEF, an additional 260,000 children across 15 of the most affected countries 12 of which are in Africa have suffered from severe wasting since the beginning of this year.\n\nIn response, USAID announced over $500 million dollars in additional resources above those pledged at Nutrition for Growth to enable UNICEF to scale up access to wasting treatment in the places most acutely impacted by the current food crisis. This unprecedented investment, mobilized alongside a broad range of philanthropic and government partners, will enable USAID and partners to continue this critical work in places like South Sudan, for example, where 1.34 million children are expected to suffer from wasting this year. As we scale up these life-saving services for children, we also need to focus on strengthening health systems so they can effectively respond to evolving nutrition needs.\n\nFor our part, USAID helps countries strengthen their ability to deliver and scale their nutrition services through existing health structures, including by training health workers to counsel new moms on breastfeeding practices and providing nutrition services at infant care facilities.\n\nIn Rwanda, for example, USAID interventions have led to exclusive breastfeeding rates of over 80 percent and vitamin A supplementation reaching over 90 percent of children. USAID is also redoubling our commitment to large-scale food fortification. Increased public investment in food fortification remains one of the most cost-effective ways to tackle malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. 372 million preschool-aged children and 1.2 billion women globally are estimated to have one or more micronutrient deficiencies, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections, birth defects, and cognitive impairment. Meanwhile, iron and iodine fortification costs less than ten cents per person.\n\nThis October, alongside private sector companies, civil society, and country governments, USAID announced a new $75 million dollar investment to scale our current food fortification efforts. Recognizing that no government or donor can achieve results alone, our expanded programming puts the food industry at the center of the solution, seeking to build trust and provide the technical assistance and financing needed to integrate fortification into their businesses.\n\nUSAIDs programming also works with partner governments to set and enforce nutritional standards, helping to expand the number of countries with fortification mandates and raise compliance rates across low-and middle-income countries with existing standards. Finally, were investing in long-term food security solutions that will prevent malnutrition from occurring in the first place.\n\nThanks to bipartisan support in Congress, the U.S. Government is committing $760 million to expand and scale agricultural programs that support farmers and communities around the world buffeted by rising food, fuel, and fertilizer prices. As COVID-19, climate change, and Putins war against the people of Ukraine continue to undermine food systems, it is on all of us to keep striving to feed the world.\n\nAfrican institutions are increasingly leading the charge to mobilize domestic and international resources and provide political will. Just this morning, AU Commissioner Samat delivered the Martin J. Forman Lecture, demonstrating the leadership on nutrition needed to drive change. And civil society is working hand-in-hand with partners in Africa and helping to elevate the importance of investing in nutrition. Together, we have an opportunity to build support for our shared goal of a world that is fed and nourished. Thank you.\n\nPress Statement\n\nNed Price, Department Spokesperson\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\nToday, the United States is removing 17 individuals from the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List. We are also designating four Zimbabwean individuals and two entities. The Zimbabwe sanctions program targets human rights abusers and those who undermine democratic processes or facilitate corruption. The 17 individuals being removed today were found no longer to undermine Zimbabwes democratic processes and institutions or to otherwise meet the criteria for designation.\n\nSanctions are not intended to be permanent but to incentivize changes in behavior. Each removal is based on a thorough review and is part of an ongoing effort to keep the sanctions program current, focused, and relevant. Maintaining the integrity of U.S. sanctions is the driving principle behind a rigorous review process that evaluates every request for removal individually on its merits and applies consistent standards to all of them.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating Sandra Mpunga, Nqobile Magwizi, Obey Chimuka, and two entities, Fossil Agro, and Fossil Contracting, pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13469, for their ties to previously designated Kudakwashe Tagwirei and his company, Sakunda Holdings. Additionally, OFAC is designating Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jr., the Zimbabwean presidents son, pursuant to E.O. 13391.\n\nTodays actions demonstrate the United States continued commitment to act in support of a transparent and prosperous Zimbabwe. U.S. sanctions do not target the Zimbabwean people, the country of Zimbabwe, or Zimbabwes banking sector.\n\nWe again call on the Zimbabwean government to take meaningful steps towards addressing the root causes of many of Zimbabwes ills, including corrupt elite and their abuse of the countrys institutions for their personal gain. Ahead of the 2023 elections, it is imperative to ensure Zimbabweans have the opportunity to vote elections that are free from violence, repression, and electoral manipulation.\n\nFor more information on todays action, please see the Department of the Treasurys press release.\n\nU.S. Trade and Development Agency\n\nPress Release\n\nArlington, VA\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\nToday, U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) Director Enoh T. Ebong convened the leaders of Africas preeminent finance institutions to discuss the future of infrastructure finance on the continent. Joining Director Ebong were Wally Adeyemo, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, and Reta Jo Lewis, President and Chair of the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The discussions took place on the eve of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, which President Biden is hosting in Washington, D.C., on December 13-15, 2022.\n\n\"USTDA is one of the leading infrastructure project preparation facilities operating in Africa. This is due to our 30 years of experience, our expertise, and the premium that we place on partnering as equals with Africas public and private sectors and financial institutions,\" said Director Ebong. \"Our partners in finance and across U.S. industry have a deep and nuanced understanding of Africas markets. Together, we can offer Africa world-class solutions for its infrastructure development and economic growth.\"\n\nUSTDAs grant-based project preparation assistance includes feasibility studies, technical assistance and pilot projects. This early-stage support helps structure and define the technical options for infrastructure projects while improving their bankability for financiers.\n\nThe financial institutions that participated in the USTDA-led discussion include: Africa Finance Corporation, Africa Investment Forum, Africa50, African ExportImport Bank, Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa, Development Bank of Southern Africa, Ecobank, Heirs Holdings, Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Company, Standard Bank Group, Trade and Development Bank, UBA America, and Vista Group Holding.\n\nUSTDAs current portfolio in Africa comprises more than 80 ongoing activities across 26 countries, with the potential to help unlock more than $15 billion in public and private financing and more than $7 billion in U.S. exports.\n\nThe U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit will highlight how the United States and African nations are strengthening partnerships to advance shared priorities. The Summit reflects the U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa and the African Unions Agenda 2063, both of which emphasize the critical importance of the region to meet this eras defining challenges. President Biden invited 49 heads of state and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission to participate.\n\n###\n\nRemarks\n\nAntony J. Blinken, Secretary of State\n\nJulieta Valls Noyes, Assistant Secretary\n\nBureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration\n\nTreaty Room\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\nASSISTANT SECRETARY NOYES: Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary, Hamdi, Abdul, colleagues, and guests. It is a great pleasure to be here today and welcome you all on this wonderful occasion when the room is so beautifully decorated.\n\nMy name is Julieta Valls Noyes and Im Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration. Our bureau leads humanitarian assistance and humanitarian diplomacy at the State Department, and we administer the United States generous assistance provided by American taxpayers and appropriated by our Congress.\n\nThis humanitarian aid saves lives and alleviates suffering, and upholds human dignity for tens of millions of forcibly displaced persons, crisis-affected people around the world, including refugees, victims of conflict, stateless persons, and vulnerable migrants. As a career Foreign Service officer, I am so proud to lead the many talented professionals in our bureau, and as the daughter of refuges myself, I am humbled by this responsibility.\n\nFor both professional and personal reasons, I am so proud of the initiative that were here to launch today.\n\nMr. Secretary, I would like to introduce Hamdi Ulukaya. As many people know, Hamdi, who hails from Turkey, founded Chobani in 2005 with the mission of making better food accessible to more people while improving local conditions. Hamdi is also a devoted philanthropist, and he founded the Tent Partnership for Refugees in 2016. Under his leadership and supported by his teams dedication in the years since, Tents network today now tops 300 companies. They are all committed to providing tens of thousands of refugees with work, training, and mentorship opportunities in order to improve their economic security and facilitate their integration into our country and other countries.\n\nWhen Hamdi and I first met this past summer, we shared a vision of advancing the potential and the possibility of refugees worldwide by harnessing their talents and their dedication through private sector opportunities. This new partnership will capitalize on our mutual vision and capabilities, and its been months in the making and I am so excited to see where it will lead us.\n\nId also like to introduce Mr. Abdul Nasir Rahimi. I had the great pleasure of meeting Abdul in New York at Tents summit for business on the margins of the UN General Assembly in September. His story is only one of those that have been impacted by Tents work and the commitments of its member businesses, and Im so happy he could be here today. Im happy to see you again, Abdul.\n\nAnd without further ado, Mr. Secretary, the floor is yours.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, Julieta, thank you so much. Thank you for the introduction, but especially thank you for the work that you and your amazing team are doing every single day to stand for and to stand with those who are persecuted and forcibly displaced from their homes.\n\nThis work is incredibly important to the department, its incredibly important to me on a personal level as well, and Im grateful beyond words for the work thats being done every single day here in Washington but also around the world.\n\nHamdi and I actually know each other. We and I go back to 2016 when Tent was founded. Its a remarkable thing because Hamdis vision but not just vision, the ability to bring this to life has been incredibly powerful. But so has and we were just talking about this so has his dedication, because this goes back to 2016. I remember well on the margins of the UN General Assembly with President Obama the many of the companies that were founding members of Tent came together. But the dedication and the drive to mobilize the power of the business community to create genuinely life-changing opportunities, economic security for refugees worldwide, is making a profound difference in life after life after life, and its the sticking with it that is almost as powerful as anything else. Its easy to might have been easy to fold the tent, but no. (Laughter.)\n\nThis year, as you all know, we have hit around the world what is truly a sobering milestone: We now have more than 100 million people, for the first time in recorded history, forcibly on the move from their homes. Of those 100 million or so, about 35 million people are refugees or asylum seekers. And more than a million are children born as refugees.\n\nThey have gone through incredibly difficult ordeals. But one of the things that we all know is that the journey isnt over even when they arrive at the destination.\n\nFinding a home. Learning a language. Seeking a job. Getting kids into school. Building community. All of these steps are essential for refugees to build new lives in new lands.\n\nThe United States is committed to supporting them.\n\nAround the world, we are the single largest provider of humanitarian assistance to people in need. In just the last year, the State Department alone has provided billions of dollars in assistance for refugees, including $2.2 billion to the UN Refugee Agency.\n\nHere at home, the Biden administration has made it a priority to expand and modernize our refugee admissions program, including by raising our annual admissions target to 125,000 people a year thats more than eight times what it was just a few years ago. And were working toward that goal. I wish it were like flipping a light switch, but a lot of work has to go into getting us back and beyond where we were.\n\nWere also assisting Ukrainians and Afghans whove fled their countries and sought safety here in the United States in part by collaborating with Welcome.US, an organization thats mobilizing American citizens and businesses to support our new neighbors.\n\nIn all we do, we know that we can best and most effectively help refugees when we work alongside partners.\n\nThis is a task, this is a responsibility more than a responsibility, also a profound opportunity that no single institution or entity can effectively take on alone, including the U.S. Government. And that is one of the main ideas behind the United Nations Global Compact on Refugees. By partnering with the private sector and also with civil society, with international organizations, with other groups governments can do more and do better in their support of refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nToday, the United States and Tent are bringing that spirit of collaboration to a new memorandum of understanding that were about to sign. Weve both made commitments toward the goals of the compact; now well partner to build upon one of those pledges: expanding economic opportunity for refugees outside of the United States. Well help create platforms for others including the private sector so that they can be part of this work.\n\nOver the next couple of years, Tent, the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration will support companies that hire refugees abroad. Tent will help companies directly, for example, by offering guidance on employment laws. Here at State, well support Tent, sharing our expertise, working together to engage other governments, international organizations, so that we can help reduce barriers to employment for refugees and continue strengthening a global coalition to support them.\n\nAs Ive gone around over the years and met with refugees in many, many other countries, its almost palpable: Sometimes youll be in a room and youll have women who are there, and they are so focused on making sure that their children are cared for and properly integrated, and of course that goes with getting them into school. And theres almost a palpable anxiety but also energy that you feel.\n\nThe men sometimes Ive found in my experience are initially almost depressed, and it goes to something that I think is equally profound, and that is the desire to be productive members of the communities that theyre joining. And thats the essence of dignity. When they dont have an opportunity to work, when they dont have an opportunity to provide for their families, when they dont have an opportunity to be productive members of these communities, they feel it powerfully and it really does go to the sense of dignity thats so important to every single human being.\n\nAnd so the opportunity to make sure that refugees coming in can find gainful employment can actually add, contribute to their communities, which we see powerfully around the world. That is fundamentally important.\n\nNow, one of the things that Ive also found incredibly powerful when you happen to also meet with the children, separately, is theyre children. (Laughter.) And they still have that incredible optimism, hope that comes with being that age, and that is in and of itself an incredibly powerful resource.\n\nDoing all of this is the right thing to do, but its also the smart thing to do.\n\nWe know refugees have extraordinary talents, expertise, ideas that benefit companies, that benefit communities.\n\nIn fact, we know again, from experience that the most driven, energetic, determined, strong people on Earth tend to be refugees because everything theyve had to go through to get to where they are is evidence of that strength, evidence of that opportunity to contribute. And we see that here in the United States day in, day out.\n\nSo one example, one exemplar of this is Abdul Nasir Rahimi. He worked with the United States military as a translator and cultural advisor in Afghanistan before he fled the Taliban. This year, he and his family moved to Virginia, where he got a job with Hilton which happens to be a member of the Tent Partnership. Hilton recognized Abduls skills and experience made him an ideal fit to oversee the security of their customers in McLean, where I happen to live so they hired him.\n\nAbdul, thank you, thank you, thank you for working alongside our troops. Thank you for joining us today. And thank you for sharing more about your experience, which were eager to hear.\n\nBut let me just say in conclusion, with this new memorandum of understanding, we will help begin more stories like Abduls, overseas, in countries around the world.\n\nFinally, Hamdi, let me just say again, thank you for this partnership. Thank you for beginning a new chapter in the partnership. Im very much looking forward to the work that the department and Tent will do together in the years ahead.\n\nSo with that, my friend, the floor is yours.\n\nMR ULUKAYA: Mr. Secretary, thank you so much. This is a moment that we will never forget, and its an honor to be with you. And Ill be very brief. If you pick the most important points that Mr. Secretary made, is the most important moment for a refugee is the moment they get a job. And thats the moment they stop being a refugee. And I saw that when I was running my factory in upstate New York and when we hired refugees to come into our factories, and I saw right there alive how their life has changed and how they evolve and how it affected their families and children. And I didnt even know it back then that this was a refugee work. I thought that was just a community work, that people within the communities need to be hired.\n\nLater on when I visited the UNHCR and some other refugee organizations, I realized the absence of business and connecting back to my experience in our plant in upstate New York, how important job is. I said if I can take this model and try to convince companies to give a chance for refugees to be with them and see what the result is, and thus the idea was Tent. But it wasnt until 2016, when Secretary mentioned that we met with President Obama and Vice President Biden and some other businesses and some other organizations, that gave me that initial light to take Tent to the next level.\n\nThe convincing of the business community that this is good for the business, not only for these refugees but this is also good for the business, dives into the studies economic studies and examples. It took us a while to get there. But also how this work is extremely important for communities, and we can name a couple of communities that I am familiar with Twin Falls, Idaho; Utica, New York; and all across the country bringing them all together and the passion that people have in this country that work in these companies that opening door to help refugees, and also the consumer rewarding companies that having this kind of consciousness of helping people who have desperately need. This connection was made because I have this most amazing team at Tent led by Gideon and Scarlet and all the smart and passionate people, and some of them here.\n\nThat we work every single morning and making those calls and making those connections and understanding what the obstacles are and how we can remove, and reach out to our colleagues and all those businesses and see how we can get together and solve these problems.\n\nMr. Secretary, as you know and Assistant Secretary Noyes joined the last event we had, we had 45 companies committing over 20,000 jobs in the United States. And I must tell you, those moments to lead into that summit, it was one of the most beautiful moments of my life where we had these connections with the companies and coming and reaching out and willing to help in all dimensions, and CEOs and head of HRs.\n\nAmerican companies are leading the way again. And I was amazed that this example of willingness to help refugees but also help themself, if we can take it to the rest of the world, how would that mean? Its another leadership that America and American companies are playing. With this effort, sir, well take this knowledge we already opened our office all across the Europe; we have reached out to Mexico; we are going to all the corners of the country and take this example, and encouraging and helping companies to hire refugees, and not only affect their families but also their businesses and their communities.\n\nWe want to thank you and your team, and of course Under Secretary Noyes, thank you so much, Assistant Secretary, for your passions and for your work. And we will make you proud, and we will (laughter) we will continue to work on this every single day.\n\nAnd with that, Ill leave the podium for my friend, Abdul. (Applause.)\n\nMR RAHIMI: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary. My name is Abdul Nasir Rahimi and I am the safety and security manager working with the Hilton McLean. I would like to mention, I am that Abdul that President Biden mentioned my name in a press conference and he said were going to get you out of Afghanistan last year, I guess 20. And Im here with my three kids and with my wife.\n\nOur journey was frightening. (Applause.) Our journey was frightening, and our lives completely changed in two, three weeks in the USA. And spending months on military bases in New Jersey and in Qatar, and then resettling in Virginia as we begin our new life in Virginia, many people helped me a lot, my American friends. And thank you.\n\nAnd I attended a job fair where I met the team from Hilton McLean there. And for the first time, they offered me a supervisor. And with this an interview, and they offered me as a safety and security manager position. This has changed my life. I love the opportunity that I see there every day, the work that the organizations like Tent and Hamdi sir, thank you so much and the companies like Hilton are doing together is so important for the refugees. The focus they have put on connecting refugees to work, to hiring, training, and mentoring is making a difference. Its empowering more and more refugees around the world to build lives, discover opportunity and hope, and support their own communities along the way.\n\nI am honored and grateful to be part of this moment. By coming together through this initiative to provide opportunities, companies will be able to support refugees both in USA and around the world in even greater numbers and go and change the lives of the refugees or other people. And thank you for everything that you guys did for me. Thank you so much. (Applause.)\n\nASSISTANT SECRETARY NOYES: Mr. Secretary, Mr. Ulukaya, would you like to proceed to the table for the signing?\n\n(The MOU was signed.)\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Now its official. (Applause.) Well done. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. Thank you all for being here, and we really are grateful for this partnership and looking forward to making a real difference in the lives of others. Thank you.\n\nMR ULUKAYA: (Off-mike.)\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: All right. Thanks, everyone. Good to see you.\n\nMedia Note\n\nOffice of the Spokesperson\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\nThe Department of States Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) is pleased to announce a public-private partnership with the Tent Partnership for Refugees (Tent) to support employment opportunities and economic integration for refugees and other forcibly displaced people around the world.\n\nThe Tent Partnership for Refugees, founded by Chobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya, is a business coalition made up of more than 300 multinational companies committed to supporting refugees through hiring, training, and mentorship.\n\nSecretary Blinken signed a memorandum of understanding with Tent Partnership for Refugees today. This partnership seeks to mobilize U.S. and international businesses and corporations to connect refugees to work opportunities a critical pathway to the long-term economic and social resilience of both refugees themselves and the communities which host them.\n\nFor further information, please contact prmpressrequest@state.gov. To find out more about Tent, please contact info@tent.org.\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury\n\nPress Release\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\nAs Prepared for Delivery\n\nThank you, Director Ebong and Chair Lewis, for convening this panel this morning. Let me first offer my congratulations to USTDA on its 30-year anniversary.\n\nOver the past 30 years, USTDA has grown to be one of the worlds largest project preparation facilities, but remarkably, with an overall budget that is quite modest. That is because the work that USTDA does is not only critical, but also catalytic.\n\nThe U.S. federal government is uniquely positioned to mobilize investment and fuel a robust pipeline of vital infrastructure programs, and Id like to thank USTDA for spearheading so much of this work. Today, I want to focus on where were centering these efforts within Treasury, and how the private and philanthropic sectors can join us to extend this impact.\n\nUnprecedented global disruptions over the past several years have disproportionately affected middle- and low-income countries around the world, and especially African nations. The reality is that the effects of COVID, Russias war of choice against Ukraine, and of rising interest rates in advanced economies have left many African governments balance sheets stretched thinthreatening their ability to fund needed infrastructure projects.\n\nEstimates by the African Development Bank suggest that the infrastructure finance gap for the African continent is between $68 billion and $108 billion per year. What these numbers mean in real terms is that closing this gap is essential to fund infrastructure that lights peoples homes and businesses, enables industry to deliver goods to market, responds to COVID, and makes communities more resilient against extreme weather.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we need to redouble our efforts to mobilize private capital. Private investment in middle- and low-income countries peaked in 2012 and has trended down since. In 2021, private investment in Africa fell an alarming 38 percent.\n\nAt the same time, we know that the amount of capital sitting on the sidelines continues to hit record levels. Infrastructure-specific funds now hold $298 billion in deployable capital. Thats not to mention the nearly $38 trillion held by OECD pension funds, a tiny fraction of which would be enough to bridge the infrastructure finance gap.\n\nThere is a clear disconnect between the large amount of available private sector capital and the urgent need to fund critical infrastructure projects in Africa and elsewhere. The question for us is: how do we connect this massive supply of savings with high quality infrastructure projects in Africa?\n\nAt Treasury and across the Biden Administration, we are working to leverage public and philanthropic capital to de-risk infrastructure projects and catalyze private sector investment, including from many of the folks with us today.\n\nSpecifically, we are championing the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGII, a G7-led, whole-of-government initiative that aims to mobilize$600 billion in public and private capital. To achieve this scale, concessional capital will need to play a significant role to change the risk-reward calculation for many of these critical infrastructure projects. We are working to figure out how best to deploy these scarce concessional resources to maximize their impact and Africa is a priority.\n\nBut we also need to look carefully at the systemic challenges African nations face, like climate change. Rather than providing band-aids of low-commitment, short-term funding, we need to invest in transformational initiatives that address these challenges at their root. That is why we are very excitedin collaboration with our interagency partners, including USTDAto advance the Just Energy Transition Partnership or JETP model.\n\nThe JETP is a country-led model that brings to bear the resources of the United States, as well as those of the G7 and other donor countries, to invest in the infrastructure required to meet our partner countries most ambitious carbon emission reduction goals. JETPs focus not only on building clean energy infrastructure, but on doing so in a \"just\" way that provides necessary resources to coalminers and coalmining communities to support them through this transition.\n\nThe $8.5 billion South Africa JETP pioneer partnership announced at COP26 last year was the largest climate finance deal for a single country. I want to be clear, however, that we never intended for this to be a single investment by the U.S. government and our partners alone. Similar to other Treasury initiatives, the public money that we put forward through the JETP is designed to crowd in much larger volumes of private capital.\n\nLastly, we are working to adapt the MDBs to meet the evolving needs of our world today. We are taking a fresh look at their operating models, pushing MDBs to stretch their existing capital to better crowd in the private sector and mobilize large pools of private savings for priority investments, including African infrastructure. Our teams are working diligently on this, and hope to make tangible progress by the Spring Meetings.\n\nThank you again to my colleagues at USTDA for hosting this important event. And congratulations again on your 30 -year anniversary. I look forward to our continued collaboration as we redouble our efforts to mobilize private capital for African infrastructure.",

                "cc_text": "From 2 Dec 2022 07.07 EST Germany calls for peace talks - but Moscow says west must accept annexations The German chancellor Olaf Scholz has urged the Russian president Vladimir Putin to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict as soon as possible, \"including a withdrawal of Russian troops\", when the two leaders spoke recently. According to the Reuters news agency, Scholzs spokesperson said: The chancellor condemned in particular the Russian airstrikes against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and stressed Germanys determination to support Ukraine in ensuring its defence capability against Russian aggression. The Kremlin said Putin told Scholz the German and western line on Ukraine was \"destructive\" and urged Berlin to rethink its approach. Its readout of the call served to highlight the gulf between Russia and western governments over Ukraine, even though Moscow and Washington have both said in the past 24 hours they are open in principle to talks, Reuters reports. The Kremlin said: Attention was drawn to the destructive line of Western states, including Germany, which are pumping the Kyiv regime with weapons and training the Ukrainian military. All this, as well as comprehensive political and financial support for Ukraine, leads to the fact that Kyiv completely rejects the idea of any negotiations. Kyiv has said peace talks are possible only if Russia stops attacking Ukrainian territory and withdraws its troops from Ukrainian soil. The Kremlin has indicated it wants a diplomatic solution and claimed Putin had always been open to talks, but said this was complicated by Washingtons refusal to recognise \"the new territories\" as Russian was hindering a search for any potential compromise. Separately, a German government spokesperson confirmed Berlin is not in talks with Ukraine about the transfer or deployment of Patriot air defence systems there. Reuters reports that Germany offered Poland the Patriot system last month to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people. The Polish defence minister Mariusz Baszczak later asked Germany to send the fire units to Ukraine instead.\n\nUpdated at 11.47 EST\n\n2 Dec 2022 13.54 EST We are now closing the blog. Here is a summary of todays events: Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyivs presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyaks estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraines 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraines general staff. He said Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, would make the total public \"when the right moment comes\".\n\nThree people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson over the past 24 hours , the regional governor said.\n\nVladimir Putin is open to talks on a possible settlement in Ukraine but the refusal of the United States to recognise annexed territories as Russian is hindering a search for any potential compromise, the Kremlin said. US president Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was prepared to speak to Putin if the Kremlin chief was looking for a way to end the war but that Putin had not yet indicated that.\n\nRussian-installed authorities in Ukraines southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka , on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday.\n\nEuropean Union member states have agreed to put a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian oil after Poland, which was holding out, gave the green light to the deal. In an effort to reduce the Kremlins income from fossil fuels, the EU has agreed to limit the amount that can be paid for seaborne oil to diminish Moscows ability to finance its war in Ukraine.\n\nRussian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the countrys museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers organisation PEN.\n\nGermany is aiming to deliver seven Gepard tanks that had been destined for the scrap pile to Ukraine this spring, adding to 30 of the air-defence tanks that are already being used to fight against the Russian army, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday.\n\nThe Finish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help it is not resilient enough .\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europes biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraines electricity before Russias invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times, Reuters reported.\n\nThe United States is reportedly working with two Middle Eastern countries to shift advanced Nasams air defence systems to Ukraine in the next three to six months. Kyiv received two of the eight approved deliveries of Nasams in early November.\n\nRussias withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River last month has provided the Ukrainian armed forces with opportunities to strike additional Russian logistics nodes and lines of communication, the UKs Ministry of Defence has suggested. This threat is likely to have prompted Russian logisticians to relocate supply nodes, including rail transfer points, further south and east, the latest British intelligence report states.\n\nRussia tested a new missile defence system rocket, its defence ministry said today. The missile was launched from the Sary Shagan testing range in Kazakhstan. Other than saying the test was successful, the ministry gave few other details.\n\nThe chief economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on BP to exit Russia entirely after the fossil fuel firm was offered a 580m dividend by the oil giant Rosneft. Oleg Ustenko has written to BPs chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand the British company cuts ties with the state-controlled Russian firm nine months after announcing its intention to leave the country.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury has said there must be \"no way we force peace\" in Ukraine . Justin Welby added that the need for support is going to be \"very long term\", the Press Association reported.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron presented a united front on Ukraine with Biden saying he would talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is willing to end the war and only in consultation with Nato allies. \"Im prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding hes looking for a way to end the war. He hasnt done that yet,\" Biden told a news conference at the White House with Macron on Thursday.\n\nBiden and Macron pledged to hold Russia accountable for \"widely documented atrocities and war crimes\" in Ukraine. Biden said their support would continue in the face of Russian aggression. In a joint statement, the leaders said: \"Intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.\" Ukrainian refugees will spend a further five months on a ship which has been accommodating them since June this year, the Scottish Government has confirmed.\n\n2 Dec 2022 13.47 EST MS Victoria is providing temporary accommodation to Ukrainian refugees. Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA Ukrainian refugees will spend a further five months on a ship which has been accommodating them since June this year, the Scottish Government has confirmed. MS Victoria, which is docked in Leith, Edinburgh, will continue to provide \"safe accommodation for displaced people\" until June 2023 with the option to extend. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton, however, accused the Scottish Government of \"quietly\" extending the contract, according to reports by LBC on Friday. On Friday evening, Mr Cole-Hamilton told the PA news agency: This isnt a new life, its a new limbo. Ukrainian refugees deserve a long-term solution. I spoke to aid workers, working in Lviv, connecting Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Scotland with homes and routes out of Ukraine, who have described the Scottish Government as being humiliatingly underprepared. They wanted the kudos of throwing open their doors but they did none of the groundwork. I dont think when these Ukrainians are fleeing unimaginable atrocities at the hands of the Russians, I dont think they dreamed about a very crowded passenger ship.\" Appropriate long-term accommodation is yet to be identified. Minister with Special Responsibility for Refugees from Ukraine Neil Gray said: We do not want people to spend any longer than is absolutely necessary in temporary welcome accommodation, however, we know from speaking to those on board the MS Victoria that it is a safe environment that has built a powerful sense of community. Weve extended the contract with the MS Victoria to continue to safely accommodate arrivals from Ukraine. Work continues to match people in temporary accommodation with hosts and matching teams are operating on board both ships.\"\n\n2 Dec 2022 13.12 EST A theatre destroyed in Mariupol in March. The Russian word for \"children\" is written on the pavement. Photograph: Reuters Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the countrys museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers organisation PEN. The report stated: Culture is not collateral damage in the war against Ukraine; its a target, a central pillar of Russian President Vladimir Putins justification for the war. Putin has repeatedly claimed that Ukrainian culture and language simply dont exist. By targeting art museums, music halls, libraries, theaters and historical sites, he attempts to make it so.\" PEN cited Ukraines Ministry of Culture as saying that 529 \"cultural heritage and cultural institutions\" have been destroyed or damaged since the war started. The figure includes both sites of national importance and cultural venues in towns and villages, the report said. The list includes the bombing in March of a theatre in Mariupol, where hundreds of people were sheltering. Around 600 people died in the attack, according to an Associated Press investigation. The PEN report said Russian soldiers have also seized and destroyed Ukrainian literature and Ukrainian-language books from public libraries in occupied regions. However, it acknowledged \"it is not always possible to determine if the bombings of cultural sites are deliberate or the result of Russias indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas.\" PEN Ukraine said it has documented 31 civilian writers, artists and other cultural workers killed in Russian attacks this year, and that some other cultural figures have died while fighting with Ukrainian forces. American author and publisher Dave Eggers, part of the PEN delegation that presented the report, said: The irony of Putins attempts to erase the culture and heritage of Ukraine [is it] has only enriched their culture and made the world pay attention and be far more interested in Ukrainian writers and traditions.\"\n\n2 Dec 2022 12.29 EST Andrew Roth A dog with a lit-up collar walks in a street during a blackout in Kyiv last month. Photograph: Andrew Kravchenko/AP The Kremlin thought it would sweep across Ukraine and take Kyiv in a matter of days. Now, more than nine months into its disastrous war with Ukraine, the new Russian strategy of targeting the infrastructure that brings light, heat and water into millions of Ukrainian homes has revealed Russias own weakness and its desperation in the face of a defiant Ukrainian resistance. Russias impotence and the scale of the destruction wrought by Moscow against territory it considers its own has leaked back into official statements, even as the Kremlin seeks to leave Ukraine in a dire state on the cusp of a bitter winter. At moments, Russian officials have compared the destruction in Ukrainian cities and its strategy to that of the second world war, nearly portraying the strategy as one of scorched earth. At a press conference on Thursday, the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was given a tough question about Russias shelling of Kherson, a city it claimed to annex in September and then fled from in November, and now regularly shells from across the banks of the Dnipro River. \"How can you justify missile attacks on the civilian population, infrastructure, depriving people of access to water and electricity, including in the area of Kherson, which Russia considers its territory?\" he was asked. \"The city of Stalingrad was our territory,\" replied Lavrov, referring to the modern city of Volgograd that was stage to the deadliest battle of the second world war. \"We hit the Germans such that they ran away from there.\" Moscows current strategy stands in stark contrast to Russias initial plan: a shock-and-awe strike on Kyiv and other cities that would let them take over the country and its key infrastructure within weeks.

The estimate is at the lower end of market analysts forecasts of the combined impact of the ban and a proposed price cap on Russian oil, although the sources said the true level would depend on several factors yet to be settled. They requested anonymity to discuss sensitive market dynamics connected with the conflict in Ukraine that Russia calls a \"special military operation\", Reuters said. Alexei Kokin of Otkritie brokerage broadly agreed with their assessment of the likely impact of Western measures on Russian output. Its roughly the same as the volume of seaborne supplies to the EU in recent weeks. I dont think they (Russian producers) will be able to divert that elsewhere. The west wants to squeeze Russias finances to reduce its ability to fund the conflict. Exports of crude, gas and oil products account for the majority of Russias revenues, which have stayed high as disruption to production and sales following western sanctions has been more than offset by high prices on international markets. Russias budget revenues from oil and gas jumped by over a third in the first 10 months of the year. Before the Ukraine conflict began on 24 February, Russia exported around 8m bpd of oil and oil products.\n\n2 Dec 2022 10.58 EST Turkey expects a \"clear picture\" on the war by next spring, its foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said, as fighting continued and Putin indicated he was open to negotiations. According to Reuters, he said: Now Ukraine is advancing on the ground, retaking some of their occupied territories. But Russia in return is deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure. So life is getting difficult for Ukrainians particularly, and for all of us. I think before the spring time we will have clear picture about ceasefire or truce or negotiation table. But we will not give up. As Turkey we will continue our efforts. Russias war against Ukraine became more complicated with the fighting on the ground getting heavier, Cavusoglu said, adding that some Western countries should do more to get two sides to the negotiation table.\n\n2 Dec 2022 10.41 EST Olena Zelenska, the wife of the Ukrainian president, has urged the UK and other western nations not to allow themselves to become accustomed to her countrys plight. Speaking to the Times, she has said: It is quite understandable that the west is tired. However, this phrase, I hear it quite a lot war fatigue is quite a dangerous phrase for us because that is exactly what our adversary wants. They expect people to forget and the world to get tired of the sad news and for Ukraine to disappear from the front pages. They would then feel they had the permission to do what they want. As winter draws in, she accused the Russians of trying to terrorise Ukrainians into believing they will not be able to survive. It would be wrong to say these things dont scare us, they do, but we know we must endure this. The winter is treacherous and that is what they are counting on, its not the first time they are using the force of nature against the civilian population. She also detailed how she has cut off all contact with any Russian relative or acquaintance, telling the paper: Of course, Putin is to blame but without the support of the Russian people he couldnt have done it on such a scale I have relatives [in Russia], but we dont communicate. Those relationships have ended completely There will be no point in returning to those dialogues, when your own life and childrens and your familys is in great danger and people dont even ask if you are still alive, I think such relationships are over.\n\n2 Dec 2022 09.40 EST UN-appointed investigators are looking into whether Russias attacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine amount to war crimes, one of the inspection team said on Friday. Russia has been pounding Ukraines electricity infrastructure since early October, causing blackouts and leaving millions without heating as temperatures plummet, Reuters reported. Russia says the assaults do not target civilians and are meant to reduce Ukraines ability to fight and push it to negotiate though Kyiv says such attacks are a war crime. \"Part of the analysis that we are engaged in at present is whether the attacks constitute war crimes,\" Pablo de Greiff told a news conference, speaking from Kyiv. If they do, the team would work out what it \"can do in order to make a contribution to the accountability for such crimes,\" he added. The three-member commission of inquiry established by the UN Human Rights Council in March has already concluded that Russia committed war crimes in areas it occupied in Ukraine. Moscow regularly dismisses such accusations as a smear campaign.\n\n2 Dec 2022 09.27 EST Julian Borger When Alina Trebushnikova woke up on Thursday morning, the light was on and she knew the day had already got off to a bad start. The electricity in her neighbourhood of Novomoskovsk had returned in the middle of the night and that meant it would not be on for much longer. As a result, the little house would be colder and darker for much of the day. It gets dark by 4pm in Ukraine now and temperatures hover just below zero after nightfall. Next week a deep frost is expected and the days will grow even shorter, as Ukrainians approach their hardest winter since the second world war. Alinas husband, Oleksii, was away at his construction job and would only return long after dark. Their two boys, nine-year-old Ilia and Yakov, three years younger, were at the home of Alinas parents, who have a wood stove, independent of the vagaries of the grid. Alina is 31 and has lived in Novomoskovsk since she was seven, when her parents moved out of a block of flats in nearby Dnipro to live closer to the earth, as they put it. She now spends most of her days alone with Polina, born three months ago, while making food for the family, juggling with limited light, heat and ingredients. There are no lights, its scary: a family prepares for winter in eastern Ukraine Read more\n\n2 Dec 2022 09.20 EST Ukrainian embassy in Madrid receives 'bloody package' Spanish police have cordoned off the area surrounding the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid after it received a \"bloody package\" similar to the ones sent to other embassies abroad, Ukraines foreign ministry said. This comes after a spate of six letter bombs targeted high-profile targets in Spain related to the war in Ukraine, including the United States embassy, prime minister Pedro Snchez, the defence minister, an arms manufacturer, an airbase and a European satellite centre. On Friday, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said several of the countrys embassies abroad have received \"bloody packages\" containing animal eyes.\n\n2 Dec 2022 08.15 EST EU proposes fines and jail terms for breaking Russia sanctions Companies who break EU sanctions against Russia face fines of at least 5% of their worldwide turnover, under proposals put forward by the European commission. The plan, which needs approval from the European parliament and the EUs 27 member states before it can take effect, also said individuals breaking EU sanctions would face potential jail terms of at least five years, Reuters reports. Breaking sanctions on Russia is already a criminal offence in some EU countries, but in others it is treated as an administrative offence and penalties vary across the bloc. The Justice commissioner Didier Reynders said the proposed rules would bring clarity, adding: Too many gaps still remain between member states when it comes to the punishment of violation of EU sanctions.",

And the US wants to work with its allies and partners, including South Africa, to shape the new post-Cold War era.\n\nThe US is \"not looking to be a status-quo power\", said Matan Chorev, principal deputy director of the US State Departments policy planning staff. It does not intend to defend the outgoing world order but rather to revitalise it.\n\nChorev reminded a group of South African foreign policy analysts in Cape Town recently that the planning office where he sits is the same one in which George Kennan famously conceived the post-World War 2 doctrine of \"containment\" of the Soviet Union.\n\nNow, clearly, this office is deeply engaged in trying to conceptualise a new doctrine that would include constraining the evidently imperial ambitions of another Russian leader, President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"We are now in a moment where theres a debate about what comes next,\" said Chorev, noting that, in the US and elsewhere, the failings of unfettered globalisation and the post-Cold War, neoliberal world order had been felt and recognised.\n\n\"Its not about defending what was, but shaping whats coming next. We have a vision for what that should be: a free, open and secure, prosperous world. A world where the foundational principles of the UN Charter are upheld, where countries are free to make their own choices, where sovereignty and all the foundational principles are defended.\"\n\nWashington sees two overarching challenges to its vision. One is \"strategic competition\" from revisionist, aggressive authoritarian countries. The other comes from shared global problems such as climate change and threats to health.\n\nMeeting these challenges demands revitalising the international rules-based order to reflect new power dynamics. That includes updating and modernising institutions to make them more responsive and relevant to these challenges.\n\nThe UN Security Council, for instance, should be expanded to include new permanent members including from Africa beyond the current five, namely the US, Russia, China, Britain and France. And it means the US supporting the proposal that when one of the current five uses its veto on an issue, the issue must go to the General Assembly for debate and resolution. This idea was evidently inspired by the deadlock created in the council this year by Russia vetoing all resolutions condemning its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nShaping this new, post-post-Cold War era requires building a broad and inclusive coalition of countries that share the vision. It includes \"taking a fresh look at our orientation to certain regions and institutions, to make sure that they reflect voices from the North, the South, small states, large states, developing and developed countries, and democratic and non-democratic countries\".\n\nSouth Africa would be among them.\n\n\"The scale of the challenges and the opportunities before us dont allow us to see the world through rigid ideological blocs,\" Chorev added. Creating the standards and norms that govern technology, getting ahead of the climate crisis or managing the economic future demand a broad consensus.t. This year, Nato for the first time identified Russia and China as strategic rivals, as does the US in its 2022 National Security Strategy report.\n\nSome fear that the world is not so much entering a new post-post-Cold War era but just returning to the old Cold War era, with tensions fast rising again between the West and the East.\n\nVisit Daily Mavericks home page for more news, analysis and investigations\n\nChorev disagrees that the world is regressing to a second Cold War. He noted that President Joe Bidens meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit last month was designed in part to provide the reassurance \"that we want to manage this competition responsibly\".\n\nBiden had said after meeting Xi \"that we have no interest in a new Cold War\".\n\n\"And its something weve heard loud and clear during my visit in South Africa a real concern that a sharpening strategic competition will be at the cost of a place like South Africa and the African continent.\n\n\"The notion of a new Cold War is not predetermined. We can shape the nature of the competition so it doesnt lead to conflict.\"\n\nAnd so, for instance, Biden and Xi had agreed at their meeting to restart their climate talks, which had been frozen since August when Beijing suspended all cooperation with the US in retaliation for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visiting Taiwan.\n\nThis agreement showed that \"even in a more competitive period, we can find practical, meaningful ways to cooperate on issues where our two economies, our two countries [US and China] are going to be really important. And obviously climate is at the top of that list.\"\n\nHe said the world expected the US to manage this competition responsibly.\n\nDaily Maverick asked him whether the missile that crossed the Ukraine border and hit Poland a Nato member in November had not illustrated starkly the danger of the Ukraine war dramatically escalating into a wider conflict between Russia and Nato, into a Third World War.\n\nChorev recalled that the Biden administration entered office in January 2021 amid significant concerns about the US-Russia relationship, not least because of the \"brazen interference in our political system by Moscow\".\n\nYet Biden had striven to ensure a stable and predictable relationship, including by extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which reduced the number of nuclear weapons on both sides.\n\nSo it was just not true, as some claimed, that the US was looking for confrontation with Russia.\n\n\"But whats at stake here is whether or not the foundational principles of the international order will be upheld. That includes freedom of the people of Ukraine for their territorial integrity and for their democracy.\"\n\nChorev also insisted that, while doing everything possible to support Ukraine, the US had worked equally hard to mitigate the wider consequences of the war and the food and fuel crises, and to stop the war spreading.\n\nChorev said the US shared the belief of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, South Africa and most others that the war would eventually have to end with diplomacy.\n\n\"Unfortunately and tragically, President Putin has [shown] no willingness and seriousness to engage in diplomacy,\" he said. \"And the aggression weve seen from the Russian government, its bombardment of civilian infrastructure, the war crimes that it has left in its wake every place it has left in Ukraine, make clear that unfortunately Russia is not prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy.\"\n\nWhile the US has given considerable support to Ukraine, including heavy weapons, South Africa has remained studiously \"non-aligned\", refusing even to condemn Russias invasion. It has also abstained from every UN General Assembly resolution that has condemned it.\n\nBut Chorev insists that although the two countries have discussed their disagreement at length, \"we have a deep conviction that in our vision of a free, open, secure and prosperous world, countries ought to be free to make their own foreign policy choices.\n\n\"And we dont [make] the rest of our relationship [conditional] on alignment on every issue. So youve seen us continue to be able to work very closely with South Africa on a whole range of bilateral issues, which you saw in the scale and scope of our strategic dialogue a few months ago.\n\n\"But also on some other issues where South Africas leadership, in the Ethiopian [peace] talks, for example, has been absolutely critical.\"\n\nShould South Africa be using its influence with Russia to try to end the war? \"I do think South Africas voice matters, South Africas weight matters.\"\n\nAnd this influence had been evident when South Africa and other countries that had maintained relationships with Russia \"made clear that the weaponisation of food was a profound concern of theirs\".\n\nThese interventions had \"made the decisive difference\" in persuading Moscow to lift its blockade of Ukraines Black Sea ports, allowing millions of tons of vital grain to be exported to the world, including Africa.\n\nThe Biden administrations \"core theory\" was that \"on every issue of consequence for the lives and livelihoods of our people, Africas voice the choices that Africans make will make a consequential difference\".\n\nChorev does not fear, as some others do, that the Democratic Partys loss of the House of Representatives to the Republican Party will undermine US support for Ukraine.\n\n\"Im confident US support will remain unwavering. And Ill tell you why. When you drive through towns in the United States youll see Ukrainian flags. And its not because necessarily that theres a human connection to Ukraine, although there is. Its because the American people understand fundamentally whats at stake there.\n\n\"I think the American people understand that the strength and unity of our democracy and the competitiveness of our economy is intrinsically linked to global affairs, and that what happens in the world is consequential to our ability to safeguard and accelerate our own domestic renewal.\n\n\"So if you look at the main issues of the day, whether its technology or China, the investments we need to make at home and our competitiveness, theres actually a remarkable bipartisan consensus.\n\n\"And so my expectation is that that will remain By and large I expect you will see more continuity than divergence.\"\n\nDoes he agree, as others contend, that some of the bipartisan continuity might be the result of the Biden administration itself having continued some Trump administration foreign policies, particularly its more protectionist stance towards China?\n\nChorev acknowledges that the American public appreciates that the US is entering a more competitive phase with China. But he also underscores two important distinctions between the Biden and Trump postures.\n\nOne is the Biden administrations large investments at home, mainly in infrastructure.\n\nThese flowed from \"a recognition that our ability to shape the terms of [international] competition depends in large measure on our ability to invest in our competitive strengths, which we have neglected to invest in for some time, across administrations and parties.\"\n\nThe second crucial distinction is that while Trump often neglected Americas allies, Biden recognises that one of Americas greatest sources of strength and advantage in managing the competition with China is \"our unmatched network of allies and partners around the world\".\n\nThis includes investment not just in traditional allies in northeast Asia or Nato, but also in newer efforts like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the US, Australia, India and Japan, commonly known as the Quad; the trilateral security pact among the US, UK and Australia, known as Aukus; and the US-EU Trade and Technology Council, a transatlantic forum fostering cooperation on trade- and technology-related issues, based on shared democratic values.\n\n\"And that commitment to align ourselves with our allies and partners has been in many ways [one of] the strongest pillars of our strategy and, again, one of the important points of distinction from the previous administration,\" said Chorev.

Western nations joined Kyiv in accusing Moscow of trying to \"weaponize winter\" a charge Putin has rejected.\n\n\"It was noted that the Russian Armed Forces had long refrained from precision missile strikes against certain targets on the territory of Ukraine,\" said the Kremlin readout of Putin's call with the German chancellor.\n\n\"But now such measures have become a forced and inevitable response to Kyiv's provocative attacks on Russia's civilian infrastructure,\" it said.",

While each espoused slightly different ideologies, they all had one common goal, and all eventually met their day of reckoning. These four names have something else in common as well; they are all men.\n\nThe international terrorists at the top of Americas Most Wanted posters have always been male. But, the 1,000 women in ISISs al-Khansaa Brigade and the 62,000 people in Syrias al-Hol refugee camp, (20-30% of whom still believe in the caliphate) pose a real threat to the US and the West, despite their gender.\n\nThe threat posed by female terrorists and homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) is not something that the US can leave behind in the Middle East. The radical ideology espoused by people like Anwar al-Awlaqi and posted on the Internet will continue to reach people across the world for decades to come.\n\nThe case of Allison Fluke-Ekren not only exemplifies this fact, it also shows that women can be terrorists with the same levels of brutality and dedication as any of their male counterparts. As such, they deserve the same degree of attention and punishment.\n\nIn January of this year, former Kansas school teacher Allison Fluke-Ekren, 42, was charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with material support to terrorism. In June, she pleaded guilty to the charge. The Department of Justice stated that, \"A United States citizen pleaded guilty today in the Eastern District of Virginia to organizing and leading an all-female military battalion in Syria on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), a designated foreign terrorist organization.\"\n\nFluke-Ekren grew up on her family farm in Kansas. She married at the age of 16 and had a daughter and a son soon after. While studying in the University of Kansas, she eventually divorced and married her second husband, who was a Turkish international student in the same university. Together, they had five children.\n\nFluke-Ekren moved her family from the US to Egypt, and then to Libya. While in Libya, the Department of Justice disclosed, she had helped sort through physical and electronic documents following the terrorist attack of the CIA compound in Benghazi. \"The stolen documents and electronic device, along with the summaries that Fluke-Ekren helped prepare, were provided to the leadership of Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi.\" From Libya, the family moved to Turkey, Iraq, and then Syria, where she began teaching girls how to become terrorists. Following her June 2022 court appearance, the Department of Justice said,\n\n\"Fluke-Ekren ultimately served as the leader and organizer of an ISIS military battalion, known as the Khatiba Nusaybah, where she trained women on the use of automatic AK-47 assault rifles, grenades, and suicide belts. Over 100 women and young girls, including as young as 10 or 11-years-old, received military training from Fluke-Ekren in Syria on behalf of ISIS.\"\n\nThe mother of eleven had no qualms about indoctrinating her whole family into the ISIS lifestyle. Leyla Ekren, her daughter, recently recounted how her mother brought her and her siblings to Syria against their will, took no action when she developed typhoid fever, and married her off to an ISIS fighter when she was only thirteen years old.\n\nLeylas testimony reminds us that terrorism is not just bombed out buildings and suicide missions. When women engage in terrorism, their whole family is affected by the fallout. There is a high human cost to the political statement that terrorism makes. With Leylas testimony, the court \"sought to paint a brutal portrait of Ms. Fluke-Ekrens relentless abuse of her children and her unyielding devotion to extremism,\" even calling her \"the empress of ISIS.\"\n\nFluke-Ekren also allegedly \"fantasized\" about detonating a car bomb in a crowded US shopping mall and planting a bomb on an unspecified US college campus. Some of her plans were even brought to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who supposedly approved the funding for her ideas.\n\nWomen are essential in the success of terrorist organizations. They are key assets when it comes to organizing, recruiting, and indoctrinating the next generation of jihadist fighters, and carrying out media-heavy suicide attacks. The fact that the US fails to recognize the role women play in perpetrating violence leads not only to more successful attacks, but also inhibits the USs ability to counter radicalization, a process in which women play an essential role.\n\nNot much has yet been released regarding Fluke-Ekrens radicalization. She converted to Islam during her undergraduate studies at the University of Kansas. During this time she met her second husband and began learning Arabic. It is widely said that not only was she a willing participant in moving her family to the Middle East, but she even encouraged moving away from Libya when she determined that Ansar al-Sharia wasnt violent enough.\n\nIn order to prevent similar cases of radicalization from happening, more research must be done into the causes that led Fluke-Ekren down the path she chose. Had she chosen to wage jihad within the US and conduct attacks in shopping centers or universities, the Department of Justice might have charged her with more than the sentence she received.\n\nIn November 2022, a Northern Virginia court sentenced Allison Fluke-Ekren to 20 years in prison. The US must not let its gender bias blind it to the reality that women can and do engage in acts of terror willingly, successfully, and not infrequently. The Department of Justice was able to apprehend Fluke-Ekren before she blew up a mall or a dorm in the US. But there are more Fluke-Ekrens in the world. Let us not compound the tragedy of senseless deaths with the knowledge that they could have been stopped. Women deserve as much attention from counterterrorism experts as their male-terrorist counterparts.",

Just this week, he signed a law that makes it illegal to spread so-called propaganda about non-traditional sexual relations. It's an expansion of a similar ban that Russia instituted back in 2013. To understand some of the roots of Russia's anti-LGBTQ laws, I'm joined now by Dan Healey. He's a professor of Russian history at the University of Oxford. Welcome.\n\nDAN HEALEY: Thank you very much.\n\nCHANG: So I want to start with that 2013 law I just mentioned. It banned, quote, \"propaganda of homosexuality and pedophilia among minors.\" Can you talk about, how does this new law that we mentioned expand on that 2013 law?\n\nHEALEY: It spans the same range of things, propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations, but among adults as well as minors. And it also expands the kind of venues in which this propaganda is imagined to be taking place, like on television and advertising, streaming services, the internet, and it ladders a whole series of different penalties for these different venues.\n\nCHANG: What kind of penalties could people face if they were found to have violated this law?\n\nHEALEY: Well, it's about $800 for an individual, up into the tens of thousands for an organization.\n\nCHANG: Any potential prison time?\n\nHEALEY: Prison time is there. It's mostly reserved, though, for foreigners who could be sent out of the country.\n\nCHANG: Oh, interesting. You know, this month, Russia also expanded a crackdown on free speech and activism against the government by so-called foreign agents. Last month, Putin also issued a decree to protect, quote-unquote, \"traditional Russian values.\" All of this is happening against the backdrop of Russia's war in Ukraine. What connections do you see between the invasion of Ukraine and these more repressive measures coming into effect in Russia?\n\nHEALEY: Well, I think, first of all, that you can't see the anti-LGBT campaigning as separate from the war and as separate from this growing authoritarianism in Russian society. And what's really interesting about the November 9 decree from the president on the protection of traditional values is the way that it takes the initiatives of the Kremlin around traditional values and bundled them together and made them a kind of security concern. So this war is now being fought for traditional values as much as it's being fought against supposed Nazis who run Ukraine according to the Kremlin narrative.\n\nCHANG: What's your sense of how people in Russia are responding to all of these measures that we're talking about?\n\nHEALEY: Well, LGBT people are mostly trying to leave the country. And I think something else that's going to start happening much more and activists are talking about. This is really people going underground, people ceasing to be visible, ceasing to act in organizations, and also to go back to methods of meeting and gathering that resemble the Soviet period, really.\n\nCHANG: It goes without saying that anti-LGBTQ laws and hate rhetoric are not unique to Russia. Why do you think certain political movements, certain groups, both in Russia, even here in the U.S., are increasingly targeting queer communities now?\n\nHEALEY: My sense of this is that LGBT communities offer an opportunity to these political groups. They can be raised as a particularly frightening threat to your family in some way that is visceral and that is very emotive, and it motivates a base of support. And particularly where that base of support is close to religious views, there is a lot of crossover there that works for political opportunists who are using official forms of homophobia to define their political stance.\n\nCHANG: That is Dan Healey, professor of Russian history at the University of Oxford. Thank you very much.\n\nHEALEY: Thank you.\n\nCopyright 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

The French president has specifically bristled against tax incentives for clean energy included in the Inflation Reduction Act a move that European leaders fear could cause sectors of their own economies to shift operations to the United States.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden made \"no apologies\" for the legislation but acknowledged \"glitches\" in the bill, declaring the U.S. \"never intended to exclude\" allies who were cooperating with Washington. He also suggested there were \"tweaks we can make\" to satisfy allies.\n\nMacron lavished praise on Biden throughout the news conference addressing him as \"Dear Joe\" more than once. He stressed that the two nations needed \"to resynchronize\" on trade but expressed confidence that the U.S. and Europe would iron out their differences.\n\n\"We want to succeed together, not one against the other,\" Macron said.\n\nDue to its proximity to the war zone, Europe has borne the brunt of the economic impact and the continent is teetering on the edge of what could be a significant recession. A number of European leaders, including Macron, have begun pushing against a war expansion that could prolong the death toll and economic cost.\n\nThe two leaders on Thursday stressed that Putins war must end in defeat and pledged to stand with Kyiv for as long as it took to repel the invasion. In the run-up before the conflict, Macron took it upon himself to try to negotiate with Putin, though his efforts to avert the war failed.\n\nBiden, who has not spoken to Putin since the war began nearly ten months ago, opened the door Thursday to discussions but insisted that certain conditions would need to be met.\n\n\"Im prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if, in fact, there is an interest in him [to look] for a way to end the war. He hasnt done that yet,\" said Biden, who vowed that any conversation would be done in concert with the NATO allies. Both he and Macron also stressed that any peace deal brokered must be acceptable to the Ukrainians.\n\nBiden had previously said he would not speak to Putin at all, unless it was to negotiate for the release of American citizens being held in Russia. White House officials had begun taking great pains to make sure that Biden and Putin did not cross paths at last months G-20 summit in Bali, Indonesia before the Russian leader opted not to attend.\n\nThe war has battered the global economy and fueled an energy crisis in Europe, which has become substantially dependent on Russian fuel.\n\nAfter the war began, supply dwindled and prices soared, exacerbating inflation that was already rising as economies emerged from the Covid pandemic. The U.S. has stepped in to help replace Russia as one of the continents biggest natural-gas purveyors. But its shipments of liquefied natural gas came with much higher prices. Officials said negotiations would continue.\n\nOfficials on both sides of the Atlantic, though acknowledging policy differences, stress the two leaders have a warm relationship. Macron, for a while, tried to cozy up with Trump but that relationship grew strained. He and Biden have spent time together at a series of summits and the French leader threw his arm around his American counterparts back as they walked along the White House grounds.\n\nDuring a morning welcome ceremony, both Biden and Macron expressed dedication to a united partnership between the two countries and to working together to solve global issues such as world hunger and climate change.\n\n\"Stalwart friends in times of triumph and of trial, France and the United States will meet the future just as we always have, confident in our shared capacity, sustained by the strength of our shared values and undaunted by any challenge that lies ahead,\" Biden said.\n\nMacron had taken a stronger tone the day before the bilateral meeting, accusing the U.S. of pursuing a protectionist economic policy by excluding Europe from the IRA.\n\n\"This is super aggressive for our business people,\" Macron told a group of American lawmakers. \"You will perhaps fix your issue, but you will increase my problem.\"\n\nOfficials said that a task force would meet to attempt to bridge the differences.\n\nThe diplomacy was set to shift to a glitzier setting Thursday night for a multi-course state dinner held at the White House that was decked out for the holidays. The two men and their wives also dined at a Washington restaurant Wednesday night. Asked by a reporter about why he chose Macron for his first state visit as president, Biden replied: \"Because he is my friend.\"\n\nThe Macrons and Bidens have also exchanged a number of sentimental gifts during the visit. One of Macrons several gifts to the president and first lady included a vinyl and CD of the original soundtrack of the 1966 film \"Un Homme et une Femme,\" which is the film that the Bidens went to see on their first date. The Bidens official gift to Macron and his wife was a custom mirror made of fallen wood from the White House grounds, which is a reproduction of a mirror from the White House collection.\n\nEli Stokols contributed to this report.",

Can diplomacy at this stage help end the war? Would a ceasefire right now be welcome? Could a change in Russias government bring peace? Why did it happen? After its massive assault on Ukraine, Moscow has stumbled in the face of unexpectedly successful resistance, but it fights on. It has claimed to annex new Ukrainian territories, drafted hundreds of thousands, rhetorically brandished nuclear weapons and attacked energy infrastructure. Still, enabled by Western support, Kyiv has the upper hand. Why does it matter? Western powers see Russias efforts to conquer territory and achieve other goals through aggression and nuclear menacing as threatening their interests as well as Ukraines. They believe the dangers of accepting Russian aggression outweigh the hazards of continued conflict including the low but non-negligible risk of nuclear use. What should be done? The West should continue backing Ukraine while keeping NATO outside the conflict. Pushing for talks or a ceasefire before the parties are ready to compromise would be fruitless. Ultimately, Russia and the West should negotiate new security arrangements, but at present diplomacy will be most helpful in managing the wars repercussions.\n\nI. Overview\n\nIn late February, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, transforming a simmering eight-year conflict into a hot war that has forced millions of Ukrainians from their homes and upended Europes security order. Confounding expectations, and reinforced by military and economic support from Western powers, Ukraines resistance has forced the Kremlin to revisit its goals. As Russian forces struggle, Moscow has proclaimed annexation of new territories; mobilised hundreds of thousands more troops; launched massive attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure; and reminded the world of its nuclear weapons capacity. Thus far, however, little suggests it can turn the tide. Western policymakers wrestle with tough questions about the costs and risks of supporting Ukraine. But the fundamentals remain unchanged: for all the horrors of continued war, Russian subjugation of Ukraine would be more perilous for global peace and security. NATO capitals should maintain support for Kyiv, avoid direct conflict with Moscow and convey to the Kremlin the benefits a settlement acceptable to Ukraine would bring. Nine months after Russias 24 February assault, near-term prospects for peace are gloomy. Both Ukraine and Russia insist that peace will come only if the other party concedes. Kyiv, understandably, wants Russian forces to leave all of Ukraine, including Crimea and territory held by Moscows proxies in the eastern Donbas region since 2014 and 2015. It also wants the Kremlin to drop its unilateral claim to having annexed Ukrainian land. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated that he finds the Kremlin an impossible counterpart and signed a decree ruling out negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, although he has since stated that Kyiv is open to negotiations on Ukraines terms. Moscows position has become harder to read of late, though realistically it holds out little hope for a settlement any time soon. Russian officials say they are willing to negotiate. But they reject Ukraines terms, and offer neither concessions nor explicit proposals, as they fire barrages of missiles at Ukrainian power plants. Ukrainians across the country are facing chronic electricity and water outages as a result. Militarily, Kyiv has the upper hand, but not yet a guaranteed victory, much less a rapid one. It has made territorial gains in the east, during a September counteroffensive, and in the south, including the November liberation of Kherson, the regional capital held by Russian troops since early March. It has also flexed its muscles with long-range attacks on Crimea and Russia proper including early December strikes on the Engels and Dyagilevo air bases, hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border that revealed gaps in Russian reconnaissance and air defences. But Kyivs capacity to wage war hinges upon a steady supply of ammunition and weaponry from the West, whose support remains steadfast, though some in Western capitals do perhaps have an eye on costs and dwindling stocks. Ukraine still struggles at times to ensure that all forces are adequately equipped, with territorial defence and national guard units most often reporting shortages, including of winter gear. At the same time, little suggests Russia can prevail. The Kremlin reacted to Ukraines rebound by mobilising some 300,000 men into the army, most with seemingly scant preparation. Comparable numbers, at least, have fled the country for fear of being conscripted. Moscow has also launched a blitz of Ukraines energy infrastructure, aimed at weakening its morale as winter deepens. In early December, President Putin appeared to recognise that Russia was in for a long struggle.\n\nMost troubling are Moscows consistent reminders to Kyiv and the West of the risks of escalation.\n\nMany of Russias other moves seem geared to unsettle. It deployed several thousand soldiers and substantial gear to Belarus, whence Russia launched offensives into Ukraine in February. Moscow could perhaps attack again from there, but its combat-ready troop strength (about 30,000, when added to that of Belarus) is matched by Ukraines deployments on the other side. Most troubling are Moscows consistent reminders to Kyiv and the West of the risks of escalation, invoking its own nuclear capabilities, accusing Ukraine of planning to use a \"dirty bomb\" and raising worries about a false flag operation. In late October, President Putin appeared to walk some of those threats back, though in early December, he warned the risk of nuclear war was rising, while suggesting that Russia was all too cognisant of the danger. The upshot is that the battlefield remains bitterly contested. The Kremlin appears to be banking on its partial mobilisation to contain further Ukrainian offensives as winter cold, soggy weather and mud complicate operations for both sides. Having lost Kherson, Moscow may expect Ukraine to try cutting off the land bridge of captured Ukrainian territory that connects Russian-held areas of Donbas and Russia proper to the annexed peninsula of Crimea. By moving its most capable forces east of the Dnipro river, it looks to be digging in though some of those units have reportedly gone to Donetsk to fortify Russias forces there.If, as fighting continues, Russias troops have trouble holding the line, Moscow could decide to escalate further, with another draft, even wider attacks on civilian infrastructure or, possibly, at a last gasp though the risk remains low a nuclear strike. Alternatively, it could change its approach to negotiations. Against this backdrop, this briefing addresses four questions at the centre of policy debates in Western capitals. It focuses on the risk of nuclear escalation; the role diplomacy can play at this stage of the conflict; the possible utility of a ceasefire pending broader peace talks; and prospects that a change of government in Moscow might ease the path to peace. The answers, while hardly comforting, should shape Western policy: The risk of nuclear war, while still low, is real enough and must be carefully managed. Still, it is not a persuasive argument for allowing Russia to achieve its objectives through aggression and nuclear menacing. As things stand, the precedent created by making major concessions to Russia would be more dangerous than continuing war. The risk of nuclear confrontation would, however, spike dramatically if NATO were to enter the conflict directly. Both sides need to take care to avoid this outcome.\n\nCalls for diplomacy to end the war need to be tethered to reality. The West, and Washington in particular, should keep the door open to talks. They should continue to make sure that Kyiv does not set impossible preconditions; avoid regime change rhetoric that would deter Kremlin engagement; and signal that a reasonable peace will lead to sanctions relief. Both Kyiv and the West should continue to look for areas where cooperation can blunt the wars effects for example, prisoner exchanges, efforts to sustain and extend the deal that provides safe passage for Ukrainian grain across the Black Sea, and arrangements to manage nuclear safety risks at Ukraines Zaporizhzhia power plant. But calling for peace talks when both parties see more to gain on the battlefield, and neither is ready to compromise, is almost certain to be fruitless.\n\nFor similar reasons, a ceasefire is not on the cards right now. With both parties still believing they can fight their way to a better position, each would demand ceasefire terms the other sees as untenable.\n\nThe likelihood that a new guard comes to power in Russia and brings the conflict to an end is low. The Russian state is too powerful, the opposition too weak and avenues for pressure on the Kremlin too scant for this prospect to be anything on which to base planning. Certainly, trying to force change from the outside would be counterproductive and dangerous. For as long as these fundamentals hold, Western governments should keep providing Ukraine with what it needs to repel Russias invasion. The war is exacting a terrible toll on Ukraine and wreaking havoc on the global economy and, to some degree, world affairs. But NATO powers have judged that to support the grinding fighting in Ukraine, and even bear a small risk of nuclear escalation, is a better choice for them and for the world than clearing the way for Russia to prevail through a brutal military campaign and nuclear menacing. Their calculation is that these costs and risks are the necessary price of preserving Ukraines sovereignty as well as international peace and security. That calculation is a tough one to make: to some degree, it unsettles other parts of the world. It certainly requires continuous revisiting. At some point, the logic may change, pursuant to events on Ukraines battlefields and in Russia itself. For now, though, it is the right approach.\n\nII. How Likely is Nuclear War?\n\nFor all the suffering the Ukraine war has brought, the most terrifying prospect, at least for audiences far from the front, is that Russia uses nuclear weapons, triggering a confrontation with NATO. At the extremes of discourse about this possibility in the West are two arguments: one that Western backing for Ukraine has set the world on an escalatory spiral that will all too likely end in nuclear war; the other that the West should offer greater support, because Russia is bluffing, has no intention of going nuclear and will back down in the face of Western resolve. While the Kremlins calculations are opaque, making it impossible to know for sure, the best assessment almost certainly lies between these extremes. Nuclear war remains unlikely because both NATO states and Russia fear it. But it is not out of the question that, if all else fails, the Kremlin might gamble on a nuclear strike. The best course is thus neither to end Western backing in essence, caving in to nuclear blackmail nor to dramatically increase it. Western capitals should, in other words, prudently manage the escalatory risk inherent in their support for Ukraine.\n\nA. Playing the Nuclear Card\n\nThe primary reason that the nuclear threat has been so central to media and analytic coverage of the war is that the Kremlin has made it so. Russia ushered in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine with a reminder to Kyiv and the West of its nuclear arsenal and the possibility that it might use a weapon. On the day of the invasion, Putin warned Western states of \"consequences such as you have never seen\" if they were to \"stand in our way\". Moscows nuclear signalling grew even more unnerving in September. Putin wove comments about nuclear weapons, and Russias willingness to defend its \"territorial integrity\" with \"all the systems available to us\" through his announcements of mobilisation and plans to annex some or all of four Ukrainian regions partially occupied by Russian forces. The seeming intimation was that Moscow was threatening to use nuclear weapons in response to Ukraines efforts to liberate its own territory, now claimed by Russia. Shortly thereafter, in October, top Russian officials introduced a new angle to the narrative of nuclear peril by sharing what seemed like an entirely concocted set of concerns about Ukraine. They relayed to the UN Security Council and the defence ministers of the U.S., Trkiye, the UK, India, China and France that Moscow believed Ukraine planned to use a \"dirty bomb\" on its own territory. Russias interlocutors dismissed these claims prima facie, as there is no evidence of Ukraine having the capacity, much less the will, to do anything of the sort. But Moscows allegations did raise fears that it might be laying the groundwork for nuclear use against Ukraine, in retaliation for a false flag action.\n\nRussia would resort to nuclear use only in accordance with its military doctrine \"to protect its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and to ensure the safety of the Russian people\".\n\nBy the end of that same month, Putin seemed to walk back some of Russias threats and posturing. Speaking at the Valdai discussion club, he indicated that his past comments about nuclear use had been intended to unnerve, and said he saw no reason, as yet, for anyone to use nuclear weapons. He also said that Russia would resort to nuclear use only in accordance with its military doctrine \"to protect its sovereignty [and] territorial integrity, and to ensure the safety of the Russian people\". Putins statements went only so far in reassuring, however, in part because they could be taken as a departure from the very nuclear doctrine he cited. The countrys 2010 and 2014 published doctrines state that Russia would use nuclear weapons \"in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies\" or in the event of conventional aggression if \"the very existence of the state is in jeopardy\". Its most recent military doctrine, issued as a joint, \"union government\" doctrine with Belarus, offers no conditions for nuclear use, but states that Russian nuclear weapons \"will remain an important factor for preventing\" both nuclear and conventional conflicts. Other doctrinal documents spell out conditions of use that include threats to Russias nuclear deterrent forces, but also speak of using nuclear threats for deterrence ie, to convince adversaries to back down. Putins Valdai speech deviated from these formulas, although in some cases one could imagine that the Kremlin might view threats to territorial integrity as tantamount to threats to \"the very existence of the state\". On 7 December, President Putin returned to the nuclear theme. In widely publicised remarks to Russias Presidential Human Rights Council, Putin warned that the risk of nuclear war was rising and said he viewed Russias nuclear arsenal as primarily deterrent, even if remaining somewhat evasive on his precise nuclear policy, and also noted that \"Russia has not gone crazy\". In other words, his goal was seemingly to convince the world that Moscow was not the one threatening nuclear war while again reminding his foes about Russias nuclear weapons.\n\nB. Global Reactions\n\nWestern states have responded to Russias comments with their own deterrent rhetoric, although the pitch has varied. After Putins 24 February comments, Frances foreign minister noted that the Russian president \"must also understand that the Atlantic alliance is a nuclear alliance\". Elizabeth Truss, the United Kingdoms prime minister from 6 September to 25 October, said when campaigning for the role that she was willing and \"ready\" to use nuclear weapons if needed, though she did not explicitly invoke the war in Ukraine. (Putin subsequently referred to her remarks explicitly in his as evidence that he was not the one brandishing nuclear weapons). The U.S., meanwhile, says nuclear use by Russia would lead to \"catastrophic\" consequences, the specifics of which, according to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the White House has directly communicated to Moscow. Washington has been publicly circumspect about whether and under what circumstances the U.S. would answer with force placing it in direct conflict with Russia, with all the attendant risks or turn to a range of other measures that might include cyber operations, economic responses and delivery of heavier weaponry to Ukraine. Russias partners in Asia have also urged Moscow to exercise restraint. Perhaps most importantly, China called on international actors to prevent a nuclear crisis on the continent. According to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, \"the international community should jointly oppose the use or threats to use nuclear weapons, advocate that nuclear weapons must not be used and nuclear wars must not be fought, in order to prevent a nuclear crisis in Eurasia\". India stated clearly that nuclear weapons should not be used by any side in the Russo-Ukrainian war. Despite the generally wide variance in views around the table, the G20 took a strong line on this issue in its declaration at Novembers summit in Indonesia: \"The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible\".\n\nC. Assessing the Risk\n\nDespite the disastrous consequences the use of nuclear weapons would incur including for Russia itself Moscow might, if unhindered by formal doctrine, see several rationales for a nuclear strike. Some Russian officials reportedly believe, despite all the Wests warnings, that Ukraine and its Western backers would back away from further escalation in the face of Russian nuclear use. If the leadership follows this logic, Russia might consider using nuclear weapons, especially if it senses that defeat on the battlefield is looming and, with it, the chance of domestic upheaval. Hyperbolic as it may sound, Putins propagandists often suggest that Armageddon is worth risking in service to a global mission of Russian greatness. The Kremlin might also judge, particularly in the face of major military setbacks, that it needs to make good on its threats, for the sake of credibility and absent other options. Moscow might also believe it can convince enough people that it is responding to a radiological threat from Ukraine and thus escape global opprobrium. The risk of Russian nuclear use would become far more acute were NATO to confront Russia directly. Most Western capitals appear to understand this danger all too well, given their caution in avoiding steps that edge too close to escalation, including their rejection of a no-fly zone after Russias all-out invasion and their measured response to reports of a missile strike in Poland on 15 November. If Russia were directly at war with NATO, it could conclude that the states very existence was threatened, which is the central scenario for use of nuclear weapons that its doctrine contemplates. Such a war might not immediately threaten core state functions (eg, an attack on the seat of government in Moscow) or Russias nuclear deterrent and capacity to retaliate. But because Moscow probably expects that in any such war, NATO would seek to limit Russian nuclear capabilities, the Kremlin might see these capabilities to be at risk in a range of situations that are difficult to anticipate. It might then launch pre-emptive nuclear attacks to demonstrate resolve or to use its weapons before a U.S. counterforce strike decimates them.\n\nA nuclear strike would not help Russia attain its goals.\n\nFor now, though, it seems highly unlikely that Moscow would gamble on a nuclear strike. Even leaving aside the international outrage, including in non-Western capitals, that doing so would provoke, there are strong practical reasons to eschew such tactics. Put simply, a nuclear strike would not help Russia attain its goals. Indeed, nuclear use would serve no tactical military purpose. While the fear, destruction and mayhem that even a \"smaller\" weapon (ie, one roughly half the size of the bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki) could wreak would be enormous, no crucial bridge can be destroyed, or road rendered impassable, only by using a nuclear weapon. Conventional explosives can be used to the same effect without the enormous risks to Russia itself that would be associated with nuclear use. Even beyond the likelihood of provoking a Western response, these risks include the possibilities that radiation blows into Russia, harming people there, or drifts into Europe, forcing an even greater escalation than might otherwise be the case. Consistent with this logic, Moscow has stayed strictly conventional over the nine months of war, despite its travails on the battlefield and despite attacks on Russian territory as well as on Ukrainian lands that Russia claims as its own, large swathes of which Ukraine has now liberated. Western officials are reportedly aware that Russian authorities have considered their nuclear options, but also say they have seen no evidence that Moscow has prepared or is preparing to use nuclear weapons. Moreover, militaries generally consider all sorts of options in the midst of war planning, so it is difficult to know whether the reported discussions were significant. Meanwhile, the Kremlins increased tempo of strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure horrific in their own right and conscription of hundreds of thousands of men suggest that it plans to keep its escalation conventional, at least for now. Perhaps the strongest argument that the risk of Russian nuclear use remains low is that Russia appears to be counting on its sabre rattling in part to deter direct conflict with the West. Russian behaviour thus far pairs nuclear menacing with the reality that, even as weapons for Ukraine are delivered from NATO territories, Moscow has not struck any targets outside Ukraine. Despite its rhetoric, Moscow, like its NATO counterparts, has thus far steered clear of actions that could draw alliance members directly into the war and trigger a wider, even global conflagration. Its actions suggest that it, like NATO capitals, hopes to avoid direct NATO-Russia confrontation, seeing the dangers such conflict would bring. It might seem something of a paradox that Moscow, in attempting to keep NATO out of the war, is threatening to do precisely the thing that would run the gravest risk of NATO getting more directly involved. Nonetheless, the Kremlin appears to see deterrent value in such threats.\n\nD. Nuclear Menacing and Its Audiences\n\nDeterrence is likely not the only purpose behind Russias nuclear menacing. As with its large-scale bombing of Ukrainian energy and civilian infrastructure, Moscow also appears to hope that it might frighten Ukrainians into abandoning resistance and the West into stopping support for Kyiv. In that sense, the tactic has played differently to different audiences. For Ukraine, which understandably sees the present conflict as existential, regardless of whether it is fought by conventional or nuclear means, the threats are largely ineffective and have perhaps even lost punch over time. For Kyivs Western backers, they are more salient. Violating the nuclear taboo after 75-plus years would be a seismic shock to global security, even before one considers the immediate humanitarian consequences, the possibility of radioactive fallout in Europe and the risks of catastrophic escalation that it could portend. Western officials, for the first time in decades, have had to seriously grapple with the question of how they would respond to a nuclear strike by Moscow. But even in the West, Moscows threats appear to be backfiring. While the nuclear menacing has likely strengthened the voices of those urging caution about direct intervention in the conflict, it has not bolstered arguments for ratcheting back support and, in some respects, has undermined them. At least among policymakers, Russias use of nuclear threats raises the stakes for backing down. They worry that any apparent weakening of support for Ukraine would smack of giving in to nuclear blackmail, which could embolden Moscow into believing that it can throw its weight around in a similar way beyond Ukraine. Some European officials now argue that, due in large part to the Kremlins nuclear threats, the war is existential not just for Ukraine, but also for their countries, which could be threatened in the future. This logic has its limits. Russia does not necessarily have the same designs on other states that it has on Ukraine. Plus, even if Moscows threats fail in Ukraine, it may still try the tactic again, there or elsewhere. Still, if it succeeds in Ukraine, the odds of more such menacing are surely higher.\n\nWestern governments are right to maintain support for Ukraine, while simultaneously steering clear of long-understood thresholds.\n\nBroadly speaking, then, Western governments are right to maintain support for Ukraine, while simultaneously steering clear of long-understood thresholds such as direct NATO involvement in the conflict and deterring Russia from nuclear use. The White House, although making clear that it has communicated to Russia how it would respond to a nuclear strike, remains tight-lipped about those plans, at least in public. But it may well have conveyed that nuclear use would have precisely the consequences that both sides have sought to avoid, pulling NATO into a confrontation that, even if conventional at first, would run a grave risk of going nuclear. Western leaders should also continue to encourage statements, like the G20 leaders declaration in Indonesia and those of China and India, in which non-Western countries make clear their opposition to nuclear weapons use.\n\nIII. Can Diplomacy End the War, and If So, How?\n\nNotwithstanding the bitterness the war has engendered, diplomacy among Russia, Ukraine and others has continued. In the build-up to the 24 February invasion, Western powers undertook a flurry of diplomatic efforts aimed at convincing Russia to sit down with its neighbours to negotiate a European security order that could better serve everyones interests. They also sought to reassure the Kremlin that they had no intention of admitting Ukraine to the NATO alliance, something that, despite not being on the cards prior to Russias invasion, Moscow had long described as a threat to its security. The efforts failed. Russias demands, which included a return to the pre-enlargement NATO force posture of the 1990s, were maximalist and unrealistic, but if they had been a starting negotiating position, talks could have ensued. Instead, rather than coming to the negotiating table, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Soon after the invasion, Ukraine entered into negotiations with its adversary. At first, Moscow demanded capitulation from Kyiv, which the Ukrainian government rejected. As Russias military was forced to withdraw from Ukraines north and centre, however, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators (peculiarly, especially in light of the growing role of women in Ukraines government and military, seemingly all-male on both sides) began to make progress. In particular, they agreed on specific parameters for Ukraines future neutrality an end state desired by Moscow and that Kyiv, at that point, was prepared to live with. But talks soon stalled. Moscow wanted Ukraine to withdraw forces from the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk which Russia recognised as independent states within their Ukrainian administrative boundaries on 21 February, even before it made additional military inroads into those territories and did not want to discuss the status of Crimea. Ukraine wanted Moscow to return to its positions of 23 February, as well as to postpone bilateral talks on the status of Crimea for fifteen years. The negotiations ground to a halt in late March, when atrocities, including summary executions, rapes and other torture, committed by Russian forces in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, came to light.\n\nTalks have continued ... seeking to address the wars consequences.\n\nOther talks have continued, however not concerning the core of a political settlement but seeking to address the wars consequences. Moscow and Kyiv make regular direct deals to exchange prisoners and remains of the dead. Other parties have helped facilitate some efforts notably, Saudi Arabia was a stopping point for Ukrainian prisoners of war returned from Russia, and it assisted, as did Trkiye, with repatriation of foreign nationals fighting for Ukraine who had been in Russian custody. A 22 July deal, brokered by Trkiye and the UN, to restart Ukrainian grain exports across the Black Sea, which provides a lifeline for Ukrainian farmers and global consumers and has helped facilitate Russian agricultural exports, nearly broke down in October, but quickly got back on track. It has now been extended for another 120 days starting on 18 November. Through its own diligent negotiations with both Moscow and Kyiv, the UNs nuclear watchdog agency has obtained access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to help ascertain the safety of the facility, where Russia holds the Ukrainian staff hostage and has established a military base. This record demonstrates the power of diplomacy to mitigate the damage of war, and even to end it, but also the need to ensure that expectations for what it can accomplish are realistic. Experience to date offers no reason to think that if the right formula, or the right mediator, is found, the conflict might end. To the contrary, as the discussion above shows, a wide variety of mediators have been engaged already. They have been valuable in mitigating the conflicts effects, and they, and many others, stand ready to help when peace talks become possible. But, no matter who the mediator, meaningful peace talks can take place only when Russia, Ukraine or both are prepared to compromise. Thus far, neither is. Kyiv is in no mood to offer concessions because it has continued to improve its battlefield position, in defiance of expectations of how it would fare. On 24 February, most analysts predicted that Russia would win a quick military victory in Ukraine. Some argued that Ukraine would resist, and that Russia would face an ugly fight, but these observers, too, judged Moscows military capability to be decisively superior to Kyivs. In practice, Russia proved to be far less capable than assessed, and Ukraine, backed by Western military and economic aid, has had Russia on the back foot for some time, disrupting first its plan of rapid conquest that would force regime change and then its effort to gain full control of Donbas. Moreover, after eight months of war, Russia is in even worse shape militarily than earlier on, having suffered heavy losses of equipment and personnel, including in its best-trained and most combat-ready units, and is now relying on weapons purchased from Iran. Some estimates hold that as much as half of the force that attacked on 24 February is dead, incapacitated or off the battlefield for other reasons. Ukraines long-range attacks on high value targets in Crimea and deep within Russia proper, including early December strikes on the Engels and Dyagilevo air bases (which host strategic bombers hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border), reveal gaps in Moscows reconnaissance and air defence.\n\nKyiv is confident that it is on a path to liberate ever more of its land.\n\nNow, the Ukrainian army, having taken Kherson city and made inroads in Luhansk region, is also spoiling Russias third war plan to gain and retain control of those territories that Moscow had declared annexed, even though it is only Luhansk that Russia ever had full control of (and that temporarily). Indeed, Kyiv is confident that it is on a path to liberate ever more of its land, especially since Russian troops have left Kherson, the only regional capital that they had been able to capture since February. Although winter weather and better-established Russian defensive positions may slow progress, Ukraine has little reason to expect major reversals. Even if his government wanted to cut a deal, Zelenskyy would struggle to find the political space to do it. He must answer to public opinion that is overwhelmingly opposed to any compromise with the Kremlin. September polling indicated that 70 per cent of Ukrainians wanted to keep fighting until victory, and over 90 per cent define victory as regaining all territory held by Russia, including Crimea. As more territory is liberated, reports of the suffering, including gender-based violence, that civilians are enduring under Russian occupation surely feed Ukrainians desire to regain control of their land. Moreover, although Ukraines elites are united behind the Zelenskyy administration, the countrys dynamic political scene has not disappeared, and opposition leaders would rapidly take action in the face of what they would see as appeasement of Russia. Kyivs leadership would likely not survive in power, and any deal it struck might prove less than durable, if it made fundamental concessions to Russia at this time. Russia, although complaining about Ukrainian unwillingness to negotiate, also is not in the market for compromise. Rather, Moscow appears to want only deals that cement its gains and, ideally, more: that is, to maintain its position in the south and east, if not take full control of all four territories that it claims to have annexed. For now, Moscow appears to calculate that devastating attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and reminders to Western states of the risks of escalation will combine with rising energy costs across Europe to shift dynamics in its favour. It may hope that the slim majority the Republican Party now enjoys in the U.S. House of Representatives, and particularly its faction that opposes aid to Ukraine, will erode political support for U.S. assistance. It no doubt expects erroneously but probably genuinely that if it can convince Ukraines Western backers to rethink their support, then Kyivs own calculus about staying in the war will change. Indeed, many in the Kremlin appear to still believe that Western states are forcing Ukraine to fight, even after months of evidence of Ukrainian agency. As for Kyivs Western backers, they have thus far judged that acceding to Russian coercion, and in particular nuclear menacing, would be fundamentally counterproductive to their own security interests. Of course, Western states are not a monolith, and debates continue, as exemplified by comments in November by U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley suggesting that Ukraine should seek negotiations to solidify its gains. But Milleys remarks were quickly countered by his civilian bosses. The prevailing consensus in Western capitals is that if they press Ukraine to negotiate, Russia will think they are driven by desire to end the war, even at great cost. Moscow might then not only seize the moment to press for recognition of its territorial claims, but also, as discussed above, be emboldened to more adventurism, in Ukraine and elsewhere. By way of background, on 11 November, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia was ready to negotiate with Ukraine without preconditions. On 14 November, Russias Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko clarified that Kyivs demand to withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory was unacceptable to Moscow as a precondition to starting negotiations. On 15 November, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said it was Ukraine that refused to negotiate, not Russia. On 1 December, Lavrov said Russia had never asked for negotiations but was ready to listen to proposals for talks. See \"MFA says ready for dialogue with Kyiv without preconditions\", RBC, 11 November 2022; \"The Russian foreign ministry found unacceptable the condition for the withdrawal of troops to start negotiations\", Radio Liberty, 14 November 2022; \"Ukraine refuses to negotiate, not Russia: What Lavrov said at the G20\", TASS, 15 November 2022; and \"Lavrov says Russia never asked for talks on Ukraine\", Interfax, 1 December 2022.\n\nEven if shifts in domestic politics or economic pressure were to bring about a change of heart in Western capitals ... the violence in Ukraine would not necessarily end.\n\nBesides, a withdrawal of Western support from Ukraine would hardly signal the end of the crisis. Even if shifts in domestic politics or economic pressure were to bring about a change of heart in Western capitals, which right now seems unlikely, the violence in Ukraine would not necessarily end. Nor would the region necessarily experience greater stability. While a Western about-face would greatly damage Ukraines war effort, and it might even change Kyivs cost-benefit calculations concerning negotiations, it would probably not make Ukrainian public opinion more conciliatory especially since, at this point, the Russian missile barrages do not seem to be weakening resolve. (An October survey found that 86 per cent of Ukrainians agree that their country should fight on in the face of bombardment.) There could also be other dangers to reducing support to Ukraine. Even if some Western states back away, others (particularly on Europes eastern flank) would strongly resist doing so, leading to discord within the European Union and the NATO alliance. If Russia subsequently were to act aggressively, in Ukraine or elsewhere, generating a new crisis, the states that had scaled down their assistance would be under tremendous pressure to show greater resolve the second time around likely creating even graver risks of escalation than those present today. Against this backdrop, the Western, and in particular U.S., approach to diplomacy is sensibly focused on risk mitigation and keeping options open. The White House has maintained a diplomatic channel between U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Kremlin counterparts Nikolai Patrushev (President Putins national security adviser) and Yuri Ushakov (his top foreign policy aide) to help both sides manage the risk of escalation. CIA Director William Burns met with the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergey Naryshkin, in Trkiye. At the same time, the U.S. has reportedly pressed Kyiv to stop insisting that the Putin government be removed from power as a precondition to peace talks. In so doing, Washington has signalled its discomfort with a posture that in effect makes peace talks impossible, while avoiding the suggestion that the time is ripe for such talks. So, under what circumstances might meaningful talks be feasible? Perhaps the most promising scenario a low-odds one but not completely implausible would see Russias demands change. If Ukraines battlefield success continues, Russia would have two options. One would be to escalate further, with more attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, additional mobilisations, more threats and (however unlikely) nuclear weapon use. The other would be to seek a ceasefire or peace talks. At least some interlocutors close to the Kremlin recognise that Russias resources are increasingly exhausted; that coercion and threats are not working; and that Russian forces appear unlikely to regain the upper hand on the battlefield. \"There is an understanding in the Kremlin that mobilisation will not enable a decisive victory over Ukraine\", a Russian expert close to the Kremlin told Crisis Group. If these views hold sway and the Kremlin leadership offers compromise of some sort (with details depending on battlefield dynamics), Western pressure on Ukraine to negotiate would rise. Ukraines government would also likely be more amenable, although domestic political dynamics would continue to limit what it could negotiate about. In the meantime, Western governments, while supporting Ukraine, can keep a door open to diplomacy aimed at ending the war, even if the moment now is not opportune. They should do all they can to help the Kremlin feel it can back away from the war without risking that its adversaries will try to foment its domestic collapse. They cannot, of course, guarantee Russias stability but they can try to make eventual deals with Ukraine more palatable, including, as Crisis Group has previously recommended, by dangling the prospect of easing the sanctions that have inflicted the most pain on ordinary Russians and reiterating that any peace deal would also require new security arrangements for the region as a whole, to reassure everyone, including Ukraine and Russia. To this end, recent statements by U.S. President Joe Biden, that he is prepared to speak with Putin if the latter sought to end the war, and French President Emmanuel Macron, that he would keep engaging with the Kremlin to mitigate wars effects, hit the right notes.\n\nIV. Could a Ceasefire Be a Positive Step?\n\nCalls for negotiations aimed at reaching agreement on a ceasefire abound in some corners of social media. But as with a broader deal, both Russia and Ukraine insist that an end to fighting is possible only if and when the other accedes to its demands ie, Ukraine withdraws from the territories Russia claims to have annexed (in Moscows case) or Russia withdraws from Ukraine (in Kyivs). Neither scenario is in the offing right now. At some point, if Russia continues to lose ground, it may be more interested in a ceasefire based on the battle lines then in place, but even that would not necessarily make such a deal a precursor to peace. From Moscows perspective, the point of a ceasefire would almost certainly be to buy time and space to rebuild its military capacity in preparation for new offensives and to pressure Ukraine for concessions in the meantime. While Ukraine would just as surely use the time the same way, it has little interest in quitting while it is ahead and giving Russia time to catch up. Furthermore, unless Russia is greatly weakened, it would likely demand ceasefire terms that include, at the least, recognition of its control of the territory it occupied at that time and limits on Ukrainian military activity and deployments. A Russian military expert told Crisis Group: \"The Kremlin wants to retain at least some of the territories it has annexed, and any ceasefire that guarantees this is now in Russias interest\". Accepting those terms would make no sense to Kyiv unless it, too, is facing real constraints on its fighting capacity. Again, as with a broader deal, Moscow may be counting on Western pressure to shift dynamics. But here as well, Kyiv would resist any such pressure. Western states, too, view the idea of seeking a ceasefire now as tantamount to giving in to Russias nuclear blackmail and setting the stage for more of the same an assessment that seems valid based on Russias behaviour to date. At a later point, it is not unthinkable that a ceasefire could pave the way to a broader deal. For now, though, even if new stalemates in the fighting are possible, there is little reason for either side to want to formalise them. Even were Western capitals inclined to push Kyiv toward a ceasefire and Ukraine less impervious to pressure, it is hard to imagine much upside to any ceasefire that might result under present conditions and easy to see the risks.\n\nV. Could Changing Russias Government Bring Peace?\n\nWhile, in theory, a change in Kremlin leadership might create opportunities for conflict resolution, in practice the war is unlikely to end due to pressure from inside Russia. It would be dangerous to try forcing such a change from the outside. A popular revolution is difficult to fathom. On an autocratic path even before its February offensive in Ukraine (Russia has not had free elections or competitive politics in over two decades), the Kremlin has cracked down even harder on dissent and the flow of information since 24 February, driving many opposition-minded citizens to flee the country. Putin and his inner circle control the security services, the media, elections, the courts and the economy. State-approved propaganda rules the airwaves, with independent voices available only via a reliable virtual private network (VPN), access to which can be difficult. No surprise, then, that opinion polls throughout Russia indicate support for the war and for the government. Although these polls are not reliable in a country where social media posts can draw prison time, they do offer evidence of unwillingness on Russian citizens part to express opinions critical of the Kremlins current direction. More dissent could emerge, though the odds are against it. For example, more Russians could lose their inhibitions as frustration grows with war and economic hardship, but even then, the Russian state is set up to prevent real opposition from finding expression. As of now, dissenters face a choice between leaving the country and prison. There are two exceptions. One is the freer rein given to those who support the war, but want it carried out more forcefully and viciously, and to see the forces better prepared. The second is the small wave of cross-national protests by mainly female relatives of the mobilised, complaining that their male kin are inadequately equipped and prepared. While they have faced roadblocks from officialdom, they have generally not been detained. Indeed, the Kremlin took this situation seriously enough to organise an audience with Putin for a group of wives and mothers. These, however, were a handpicked group of government workers and other loyalists. Those demanding an end to war and peace talks with Ukraine were not invited. Alternatively, it is possible that someone within the system would take over from Putin, perhaps even with his blessing were he, for example, to become ill though nothing suggests any such person emerging any time soon. In this case, peace could plausibly follow, simply because any new leader might need to free up resources otherwise tied up in the war effort in order to consolidate support. Thus far, however, though views of the war within Putins inner circle reportedly vary, its members seem to believe that they are better off supporting the current dispensation. \"They [Putins inner circle] may have different opinions on the war, but in the Russian political system it does not matter they will all do what Putin decides to do and no one will argue with him\", a political adviser of a Kremlin-connected Russian businessman told Crisis Group.\n\nA Western effort to overthrow the government is among the scenarios that Russias political and military leadership fear the most.\n\nNor is it clear exactly how Western states could act to effect a change of government, though all evidence suggests that even trying would carry tremendous danger. As noted above, a Western effort to overthrow the government is among the scenarios that Russias political and military leadership fear the most. Support for any group seeking regime change in Russia would feed the Kremlins sense that it is besieged by the West, increasing nuclear risks. If Russia is to change, it will in all likelihood have to change on its own from within which, again, appears unlikely to happen for now. While Western states and Ukraine may not be able to change Russia, they should stay true to their values and continue to engage with dissidents, championing their rights, and with exiles, offering safe haven to those who flee Putins increasingly dictatorial rule. Indeed, more openness to Russians could, over time, generate more support for better relations with the West or, at least, undermine the Kremlins arguments that the West is hostile to Russians.\n\nVI.

ArrowRight Biden this week will host the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, an event last held eight years ago under President Barack Obama. This time, the event comes as the White House is working, with mixed success so far, to coax support from African nations that have been hit especially hard by the consequences of the war in Ukraine, especially a wheat shortage and a disruption in the food supply but also rising fertilizer and fuel prices.\n\nThe African Union has condemned Russias aggression, but many nations on the continent have otherwise tried to remain neutral because they have long-standing ties with Russia as well as the United States and depend on aid from both, though the United States makes far greater investments. That has played out starkly at the United Nations, where many African countries have declined to vote in favor of U.S.-backed initiatives on Ukraine despite lobbying by the Biden administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrican leaders have made clear to White House and administration officials that they simply want an end to the war, said a senior administration official familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. The two sides disagree on what tactics to use to get to a settlement, the official said, as the Africans oppose the idea of punishing Russia or insisting that Kyiv must agree to any resolution.\n\nPresident Biden announced on Dec. 14 new trade initiatives and investments in Africa as he addressed the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in the District. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\n\"The Africans want to see a diplomatic solution to this conflict. We generally do, too, but nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,\" the official said. \"The disconnect comes when some of the countries have expressed discomfort with sanctions and critiques of Russia that they think make it more difficult to get to a diplomatic solution.\"\n\nRallying a broad global coalition behind Ukraine ranks among Bidens top foreign policy achievements, especially now that many European countries are bracing for a cold winter and face a disruption of Russian oil and gas supplies. But African countries have persistently been among the holdouts, arguing that they suffer the some of the worst effects of the conflict and see little benefit in angering Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven before Russias invasion of Ukraine, there had been a slow-building food security crisis in many nations. The United States has long been the largest provider of food assistance globally.\n\nBidens courtship of African leaders also unfolds amid a sharpening struggle between the United States and China for influence on the continent. Ahead of this weeks summit, the White House announced Bidens support for having the African Union join the Group of 20 major world economies, a major step long pushed by African leaders.\n\nBeyond that, the White House has sought to secure Africans patience with the anti-Russian effort or at least prevent them from siding with Moscow by providing aid for food and other priorities. The summit will include sessions on food security and agriculture, issues that African leaders are eager to discuss. The White House also announced Monday that the United States would commit $55 billion to Africa over the next three years in economic, health and security support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it remains unclear how long Biden can maintain the tenuous agreement with African nations as the war nears its 11th month with no end in sight. Biden and other European leaders have made clear they will not force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into negotiating with Russia and will let Kyiv decide on the timing and conditions of any talks.\n\nBiden earlier this month said he was prepared to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war but stressed that he had \"no immediate plans\" to do so because Putin has not shown a willingness to seek a peaceful resolution and has employed brutal tactics against Ukrainian civilians.\n\n\"The challenge becomes when [the United States] is asking Africans to take specific sides,\" said Mvemba Dizolele, a senior fellow and director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Africans are saying, We believe there is another way to solve this problem. Global North, United States, Western Europe sit down with your neighbors and try to bring this to a peaceful resolution.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBidens expected announcement this week that the United States supports the African Unions bid to become a permanent member of the G-20 would give African nations a long-sought prize. African leaders have for years expressed frustration at being left out of discussions on global affairs and crises that affect them, including the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nBiden has spoken with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in an effort to combat what the United States sees as misinformation on the continent about the war in Ukraine including the notion that the food crisis is caused by Western sanctions on Russia and to try to rally support for the U.S.-led effort. But South Africa, currently the only African nation that is a member of the G-20, remains among the countries that have not supported U.N. resolutions condemning Russia.\n\nThere is also a sense of resentment among many nations, Dizolele said, about the amount of money and resources going to Ukraine. The United States has so far committed more than $60 billion, and the administration has requested just under $40 billion in the most recent congressional budget deal, which is still being negotiated. Many Africans feel such resources and attention have never been devoted to their problems, whether the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the civil war in Ethiopia or warfare in the Central African Republic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussias invasion, meanwhile, affected Africa only indirectly. \"They believe while there are global implications, its primarily a Western problem, and Africans are used to being told when they have problems, they should find an African solution to their problem,\" Dizolele said. \"Thats part of the mind-set: Why is it that your problem has to be the entire worlds problem?\"\n\nTo counter such sentiments, the Biden administration is seeking to emphasize partnership rather than paternalism in its interaction with African countries, officials said, highlighting what the United States can offer amid a deepening worldwide competition for influence with other world powers, chiefly China and Russia.\n\nAs Beijing invests billions in African infrastructure projects and Russian-backed paramilitary forces help train African armies, the United States has countered with promises of food assistance and investments in farming and green power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, who launched a new strategy for sub-Saharan Africa during a tour of the region in August shortly after a similar visit by his Russian counterpart, stresses that Washington is not asking African leaders to choose between East and West. But many African countries feel there is an implicit choice.\n\nEbenezer Obadare, an Africa scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, said most African nations would have reflexively sided with the United States and its allies if Russia had launched its war in Ukraine a decade ago. But Moscow has stepped up its engagement with the continent, and today, he said, \"many African leaders didnt feel like they had to automatically line up with the West. There are alternatives there.\"\n\nWhile the continents leaders appreciate Bidens decision to hold the first U.S.-African summit since 2014, Dizolele said, they will also be measuring the scale of any aid or investment announcements, and will look to whether Biden commits to holding a subsequent summit or making a presidential visit to the continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDizolele said the impact of the Biden administrations apparent decision not to hold any formal, scheduled bilateral meetings with visiting leaders in contrast to the recent state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, his second in less than five years will probably depend on the scope of those commitments.\n\nComplicating Bidens effort further is his stated commitment to put human rights at the core of his foreign policy. Administration officials have occasionally issued public criticism of African countries including Egypt, Rwanda and Ethiopia, and they say they routinely raise these matters in private.\n\nBut on other occasions, such as Bidens recent visit to Egypt, that message has not been readily apparent. Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director for Human Rights Watch, said she did not expect the White House to use the summit to openly criticize African leaders guilty of human rights abuses.\n\nThe administration \"is going to talk about things they and the African countries mutually care about: democracy, trade, investment, food security,\" Widdersheim said. \"Theyre not going to risk publicly pressing on human rights, because they dont want to lose influence on the continent to China.\"",

As a reaction to the international community marking a red line.\"\n\nDespite deep divisions, it was important that dialogue with the Kremlin continued, Germany's leader added.\n\n10:34pm: Russians may want negotiations only to have a pause to get new recruits trained, says Stoltenberg\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said it is not a good idea to engage with the Russians overtures towards negotiations and this chimes with what the Ukrainians are saying. Gulliver Cragg, FRANCE 24s correspondent in Kyiv, reports.\n\n02:06\n\n9:47pm: Ukraine conflict intrudes on UN biodiversity summit\n\nThe Ukraine conflict cast a shadow over a high-stakes UN summit on biodiversity in Montreal on Wednesday, as Western nations slammed the environmental destruction brought about by Russia's invasion.\n\nThe broadsides by the European Union and New Zealand which spoke on behalf of other countries, including the United States came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of \"ecocide\" and of devastating his country's dolphin population.\n\nRussia fired back that the meeting was an inappropriate forum and accused its critics of attempting to sabotage a new global deal for nature.\n\n\"The war brings about pollution and long-term environmental degradation, destroying protected areas and natural habitats,\" Ladislav Miko, an EU representative at the meeting, known as COP15, said.\n\n9:00pm: US slams 'loose talk' on nuclear weapons after Putin comments\n\nThe United States on Thursday denounced \"loose talk\" on nuclear weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would only use an atomic weapon in response to an enemy strike.\n\nDeclining to respond directly to Putin, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters, \"We think any loose talk of nuclear weapons is absolutely irresponsible.\"\n\n6:49pm: EU targets Russian armed forces, banks in new sanctions, says EU chief von der Leyen\n\nThe EU's executive arm on Wednesday proposed imposing sanctions on Russia's armed forces, three banks and scores of officials, in the latest salvo from Brussels against the Kremlin's war on Ukraine.\n\nEuropean Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would also look to curb supplies of drones to Moscow and take four more Russian \"propaganda\" channels off the air.\n\n6:43pm: Kyiv mayor brushes off Zelensky's criticism as 'politics'\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko on Wednesday dismissed criticism by Ukraine's president about his office's preparations for a winter of Russian air strikes, saying he believed it was driven by politics and that it looked \"strange\".\n\nKlitschko was chided by President Volodymyr Zelensky in one of his nightly video addresses to Ukrainians last week, when he accused city authorities of failing to provide enough shelters despite the energy system being pounded by Russian attacks.\n\nOfficials are rolling out special \"heating points\" to provide people with warmth and electricity in case Russian missile strikes on critical infrastructure cause sweeping blackouts.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Klitschko responded to the accusations by saying Kyiv had considerably more heating hubs than any other city in Ukraine.\n\n\"It looks strange when we are united against a single enemy, but we start to fight within the country,\" he said.\n\n6:42pm: Lawsuit against Russia's Wagner group seeks Ukraine reparations\n\nA lawsuit in Britain against Russian private military contractor Wagner could help Ukrainians seek reparations for alleged crimes committed during Russia's invasion, a lawyer whose firm filed the suit said on Wednesday.\n\nJason McCue, of McCue Jury and Partners, said the lawsuit initiated in Britain's High Court last month on behalf of alleged Wagner victims would target what Kyiv says are the group's global assets, and aim to tie Moscow up in courts.\n\n\"Together we can shake and peel this Russian doll until its hidden layers reveal that its treasure is for us to claim and to give to Ukrainians for justice,\" he told reporters in Kyiv.\n\n6:35pm: Canada, Netherlands to intervene in genocide case against Russia at ICJ\n\nCanada and the Netherlands have filed a joint declaration of intervention in Ukraine's genocide case against Russia at International Court Of Justice (ICJ), the countries said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"Canada and the Netherlands avail themselves of the right to intervene in this case ... in order to place their interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention) before the court,\" the countries said in the statement.\n\n4:33pm: Putin says Russia may be fighting in Ukraine for a long time, evokes risk of nuclear war\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that his army could be fighting in Ukraine for a long time, but he saw \"no sense\" in mobilising additional soldiers at this point.\n\n\"As for the duration of the special military operation, well, of course, this can be a long process,\" Putin said, using his preferred term to refer to the Russian invasion, now in its 10th month.\n\nIn a televised meeting of his human rights council that was dominated by the war, Putin said Russians would \"defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal\", asserting that Russia was seen in the West as \"a second-class country that has no right to exist at all\".\n\nHe said the risk of a nuclear war was growing the latest in a series of such warnings from Moscow but that Russia would not threaten recklessly to use such weapons.\n\n\"We haven't gone mad, we realise what nuclear weapons are,\" Putin said. \"We have these means in more advanced and modern form than any other nuclear country, that's an obvious fact. But we aren't about to run around the world brandishing this weapon like a razor.\"\n\nPutin says Ukraine war may be 'lengthy' 00:24\n\n4:05pm: Ukraine's Zelensky says at least six killed in Donetsk shelling\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday said that at least six people had been killed and five more injured in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\n\"Terrorists attacked the peaceful city of Kurakhove. A market, a bus station, gas stations, and residential buildings came under fire. At least six civilians were killed, five were wounded,\" Zelensky said in a statement on social media\n\n3:49pm: Putin says 150,000 mobilised Russians are deployed in Ukraine\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that half the Russians called up for military service in September have been deployed to Ukraine.\n\n\"Out of 300,000 of our mobilised fighters, our men, defenders of the fatherland, 150,000 are in the area of operations,\" the Russian leader said during a televised meeting of the Kremlin's human rights council, saying some 77,000 were in combat units.\n\n3:44pm: Zelensky accuses Russia of 'ecocide' over damage to wildlife\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday accused Russia of \"ecocide\" for the devastation he said its invasion has wrought on Ukraine's wildlife.\n\nThousands of dead marine mammals had washed up on the shore of the Black Sea, he said, including tens of thousands of dolphins.\n\n\"And this is only a small part of the devastating consequences,\" he added.\n\n\"The Russian war has a huge impact on the wildlife of our country,\" Zelensky added, denouncing Russia's \"ecocide in Ukraine\".\n\n3:34pm: Russia strengthens defence lines near Ukraine border\n\nThe governors of two Russian regions bordering Ukraine have said they inspected the construction of defence lines days after Ukrainian drone struck key military airfields.\n\nThe governor of the Kursk region, Roman Starovoyt, shared photos of pyramid-shaped concrete blocks that appear to be anti-tank fortifications.\n\nHis counterpart in the neighbouring Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, on Tuesday reported inspecting local fortifications \"to ensure the safety of all residents who live in the Belgorod region\".\n\n2:01pm TIME magazine names Ukraine's Zelensky 'Person of the Year'\n\nTIME magazine named President Volodymyr Zelensky as well as \"the spirit of Ukraine\" as its 2022 person of the year on Wednesday, for the resistance the country has shown in the face of Russia's invasion.\n\nCalling Zelensky's decision to remain in Kyiv and rally his country amid the ongoing war \"fateful,\" Time editor in chief Edward Felsenthal said this year's decision was \"the most clear-cut in memory.\"\n\nSince Russia's February 24 invasion, Zelensky has delivered daily speeches followed not only by Ukrainians but by citizens and governments around the globe.\n\nHe has appeared on the frontlines and recently celebrated in the streets of Kherson when Ukraine pushed Russia from the critical southern city.\n\n\"His information offensive shifted the geopolitical weather system, setting off a wave of action that swept the globe,\" Felsenthal wrote in announcing the winner.\n\nTIME's 2022 Person of the Year: Volodymyr Zelensky and the

assault\n\nRussia is looking to stall the fighting in Ukraine over the winter in order to build up its forces for a renewed assault next year, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has said.\n\n\"What we see now is that Russia is actually attempting to try to have some kind of freeze of this war, at least for a short period of time, so they can regroup, repair, recover and then try to launch a bigger offensive next spring,\" Stoltenberg told a public event hosted by the Financial Times.\n\nStoltenberg said NATO members were continuing their \"unprecedented\" supply of arms and support to Ukraine despite concerns that the conflict is draining Western stockpiles.\n\n\"As important as adding new systems, is to ensure that systems or weapons we have already delivered, are actually operational or working in an effective way,\" Stoltenberg said. \"Meaning that they need a vast amount of ammunition, spare parts and also maintenance.\"\n\n11:05am: Fears of new Ukraine front as Belarus moves military gear\n\nBelarus plans to move military equipment and forces over the next two days in what it labels a counter-terrorism exercise stoking fears that Russia may mount a new attack on Ukraine from the territory of its Belarusian ally.\n\n\"During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,\" the state BelTA news agency cited the country's Security Council as saying.\n\n\"The movement of citizens (transport) along certain public roads and areas would be restricted and the use of imitation weapons for training purposes is planned,\" the agency added, without specifying which parts of the country could be affected.\n\nBelarus has said it will not enter the war in neighbouring Ukraine, but President Alexander Lukashenko has in the past ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near the Ukrainian border, citing threats to Belarus from Kyiv and the West.\n\n10:35am: Soldiers among 16 killed in Donetsk road accident\n\nMore than a dozen people have died in a road accident in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, which is mostly controlled by Russian forces, the Moscow-installed region's head has said.\n\n\"A tragedy on the T-0517 highway claimed the lives of 16 people, among them were some of our defenders,\" the Russia-appointed head of Donetsk Denis Pushilin said on Telegram.\n\nFour other passengers were injured in the accident that took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, according to Pushilin.\n\nHe offered \"sincere condolences\" and wished a \"speedy recovery\" to the injured.\n\n8:45am: I thought of Russians as our brothers how could they commit such an abomination?\n\nThe city of Nikopol in southern Ukraine lies just across the Dnipro river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, exposed to daily Russian bombardment and unable to return fire.\n\nHome to 115,000 people before the war, Nikopol has lost more than half its population since Russian forces took over the nearby nuclear plant in the first days of fighting, placing their artillery units around the facility.\n\nUkrainian forces say they cannot return fire for fear of causing a nuclear disaster. And for those left behind in Nikopol, life in the city has become a misery.\n\nFRANCE 24s Robert Parsons, Pauline Godart and Raid Abu Zaideh spoke to residents of a gutted apartment block days after it was struck by Russian fire.\n\n02:45 An apartment building gutted by a Russian missile strike in the Ukrainian city of Nikopol. FRANCE 24 screengrab\n\n7:55am: Poland to place German Patriot missiles on its territory\n\nPoland is preparing to deploy the German Patriot air defence system on its territory, after Berlin refused to place this system in Ukraine, Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Twitter.\n\nGermany last month offered Poland the Patriot system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland. Polish Defence Minister later asked Germany to send the fire units to Ukraine instead.\n\n\"After talking to the German Defence Ministry, I was disappointed to accept the decision to reject Ukraine's support. Deploying the Patriots to the western Ukraine would increase the security of Poles and Ukrainians,\" Blaszczak tweeted on Tuesday evening.\n\n\"So we proceed to working arrangements for placing the launchers in Poland and connecting them to our command system,\" he added.\n\n6:05am: US lawmakers authorise $800 million in additional security assistance for Ukraine\n\nUS lawmakers agreed to provide Ukraine at least $800 million in additional security assistance next year, according to a defense policy bill unveiled on Tuesday.\n\nThe Fiscal 2023 National Defence Authorisation Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500 million over President Joe Biden's request earlier this year.\n\nThe overall bill authorises $45 billion more in defence spending than Biden requested, as congressional negotiators sought to address the effects of global inflation and provide additional security assistance for Ukraine.\n\n3:10am: Latvia revokes licence for exiled Russian TV channel\n\nLatvia announced Tuesday it was revoking the licence for exiled Russian independent channel Dozhd, or TV Rain, for multiple violations that included showing the annexed Crimean peninsula as part of Russia.\n\nThe channel, which moved to Latvia after Russian authorities blocked its broadcasts for critical coverage of the war in Ukraine, dismissed the accusations as \"unfair and absurd\", saying that it would remain on YouTube.\n\nThe network, which was founded in 2010 as the main opposition channel in Russia, is also accused of supporting Russian soldiers, which the channel denies, and failing to ensure Latvian language translation, the LETA news agency reported.\n\n12:35am: President Zelensky meets troops near eastern front\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited troops close to front lines in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday and expressed thanks to everyone involved in the war effort to mark the country's Armed Forces Day.\n\nAddressing servicemen later in the presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelensky said he had spent the day with troops in Donbas, theatre of the heaviest battles, and in Kharkiv region, where Ukrainians have retaken swathes of occupied territory from Russian forces who invaded more than nine months ago.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and Reuters)\n\nFrance Mdias Monde graphic studio\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

The Biden administration would like to make one thing clear: It wont throw Ukraine under the bus. If President Volodymyr Zelensky doesnt want to pursue a peace deal that could leave Russia with some Ukrainian territory, America wont use its leverage as Ukraines main arms supplier to push him into negotiations.\n\n\"The United States is not pressuring Ukraine,\" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan in early November, the day after NBC reported that he had broached the subject of negotiations with Zelensky. President Biden said, that same week, \"Were not going to tell them what they have to do.\" And a week later, national security spokesman John Kirby asserted that \"nobody from the United States is pushing or prodding or nudging [Zelensky] to the table.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, maybe somebody from the United States should be. If an enduring peace can be had through negotiation and we wont know if it can until we explore that prospect then negotiations would be in Americas interest. That alone might be enough reason for Biden to steer Ukraine toward the table. But as it happens, such a peace would be in Ukraines interests and most of the worlds as well.\n\nTo start with some of the more mundane virtues of near-term peace: The war is costing America lots of money. And this spending is inflationary at a time when inflation is a big global problem. The war also fuels inflation in other ways, notably by constricting the supply of energy to European allies. And, as those allies buy American natural gas as a substitute, some European officials are accusing the United States of profiteering, revealing tensions within the West that could grow as the winter proceeds.\n\nMeanwhile, every day the war continues, more Ukrainians die, and more of Ukraine gets wrecked. And every day there is some risk of a fluke turning this into a wider war, featuring direct NATO involvement. Even if such a war didnt go nuclear, the devastation could be vast. \"World War III\" might be an overstatement but it might not (especially in light of a recent report that China and Russia have a secret mutual defense agreement).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what are the arguments against a peace that leaves Russia in control of some Ukrainian territory? The most common one involves a goal shared by the United States and Ukraine and many other countries: giving Russia a big dose of negative reinforcement for invading its neighbor. This punishment could deter Russia from repeating such aggression and deter other countries from aggression by reinforcing the norm against attacking sovereign nations (even if, awkwardly, the United States has violated that norm which is also an international law more than once in recent decades).\n\nObviously, pushing Russian troops back to pre-2014 lines (Zelenskys stated goal) or even pre-February lines, would be a powerful form of negative reinforcement and the more powerful the better. But its important to see that, even without that, this war has been extremely costly for Russia and for Vladimir Putin.\n\nSamuel Charap, an expert on Ukraine at the Rand Corp., recently said, \"Russia has already lost no matter where the line is. Russias strategic defeat is already a thing. Thats done.\" The reason, he said, is the \"astonishing damage to (a) their military capabilities, (b) their international reputation, (c) their economy, their capacity to rearm. I mean, Russia has weakened itself in the last nine months more than any U.S. policy could have done.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words: Even if Russia held onto all or most of the territory it now has, its February invasion would be seen by it and by other countries as a very cautionary tale, in stark contrast to its casual seizure of Crimea in 2014.\n\nOf course, there is one argument against a peace deal that, especially from Ukraines point of view, is potent: Justice demands that Russia give back all the land it took. But thats a compelling argument for more war only if Ukraine has a good chance of getting the land back through continued fighting and getting it back at acceptable human cost. The current state of play on the battlefield casts doubt on that premise.\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, three possible trajectories for this war:\n\n1) Stalemate. Russia makes gains here, Ukraine makes them there, but no one gets the upper hand, and Russia holds onto roughly as much territory as it has.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome people consider a stalemate implausible because Ukraine seems to have \"the wind at its back\" after Russias September retreat in the Kharkiv province and its more recent retreat from the city of Kherson.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nBut the Kherson retreat isnt a leading indicator. Reportedly, it had long been favored by Russian generals who considered the Kherson position untenable, and they finally got Putins approval sometime this fall. And because the goal was to fall back to a more defensible position, protected by the Dnieper River, further Ukrainian advances on this front are unlikely anytime soon.\n\nAs for Ukraines breakthrough in Kharkiv province: It came in territory Russia had left undermanned. Since then, Russia has mobilized 300,000 troops, and its defensive lines are being steadily beefed up. With the exception of Kherson, battle lines have barely moved since mid-September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) Russian advance. In this scenario, the continued infusion of newly mobilized troops, along with the continued impairment of Ukraines logistics via infrastructure strikes, allows Russia to turn the tide. Putin finally achieves his initially stated territorial aims wresting the Donbas provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk entirely from Ukraines grasp and expands his holdings in the two other provinces he has since deemed \"annexed.\" And maybe he goes further. There are voices in Russia calling for taking everything east of the Dnieper.\n\n3) Ukrainian advance. In this scenario, Ukraine makes big gains, pushing Russian troops back toward pre-February lines and possibly beyond them, maybe even to pre-2014 lines.\n\nAll three of these trajectories involve the continued death of Ukrainians and the continued destruction of Ukraine, and one of them involves further territorial loss as well. Only the third trajectory brings compensation for this carnage in the form of territorial gains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd these gains come with an asterisk. Sustained advance by Ukrainian troops would be seen by Putin as an existential threat not necessarily to Russia, but certainly to his regime, as his invasion came to be seen by more and more Russian elites as an abject failure. Fear of being deposed would make him more inclined to take risks on the battlefield in hopes of turning the tide. He might use tactical nuclear weapons, but even less extreme measures could draw NATO into the war.\n\nNATOs involvement is something Ukraine would welcome, but the fact is it could lead to an escalation that reaches horrifying levels. Nuclear war would be a real possibility, and even a nonnuclear version of World War III could leave Ukrainians wishing theyd settled for an imperfect peace.\n\nIn resisting a diplomatic solution, Ukraines political leadership is basically dismissing the first two of the wars three possible trajectories and placing all its hopes on a particular version of the third trajectory that you might call the Goldilocks version: Ukraine pushes Russian troops toward Russias border, putting more and more political and psychological pressure on Putin, but that pressure isnt so great as to trigger desperate measures that wind up devastating Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis might seem like a bad bet, but when your country is invaded by a larger neighbor, you have to be open to taking risks, and you have to think positive. Besides, all national leaders face domestic political pressures that can divert them from pursuing the countrys true interests. We dont know exactly what pressures bear on Zelensky, but the Ukrainian military does include politically powerful and intensely nationalistic elements that he may find hard to ignore.",

                "cc_text": "This piece is part of a series of policy analyses entitled \" The Talbott Papers on Implications of Russias Invasion of Ukraine ,\" named in honor of American statesman and former Brookings Institution President Strobe Talbott. Brookings is grateful to Trustee Phil Knight for his generous support of the Brookings Foreign Policy program.\n\nNine months into Russias latest invasion of Ukraine, the outcome of the war remains unclear. The Russian military appears incapable of taking Kyiv or occupying a major portion of the country. Ukrainian forces have enjoyed three months of success on the battlefield and could well continue to make progress in regaining territory. The war also could settle into a more drawn-out conflict, with neither side capable of making a decisive breakthrough in the near term.\n\nIn September, the Ukrainian army launched two counteroffensives. One in the northeast expelled Russian forces from Kharkiv oblast and pressed assaults into Luhansk oblast. In the south, the second counteroffensive succeeded in November in driving Russian forces out of Kherson city and the neighboring region, the only area that Russian forces occupied east of the Dnipro River, which roughly bisects Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian army gained ground in southern Ukraine, but it failed to take Kyiv. By late March, Russian forces were in retreat in the north. Moscow proclaimed its new objective as occupying all of Donbas, consisting of the oblasts (regions) of Luhansk and Donetsk, some 35% of which had already been occupied by Russian and Russian proxy forces in 2014 and 2015. After three months of grinding battle, Russian forces captured almost all of Luhansk, but they made little progress in Donetsk, and the battlelines appeared to stabilize in August.\n\nThis latest phase in hostilities between Russia and Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, when Russian President Vladimir Putin directed his forces to launch a major, multi-prong invasion of Ukraine. The broad scope of the assault, which Putin termed a \"special military operation,\" suggested that Moscows objectives were to quickly seize Kyiv, presumably deposing the government, and occupy as much as the eastern half to two-thirds of the country.\n\nProjecting the ultimate outcome of the war is challenging. However, some major ramifications for Russia and its relations with Ukraine, Europe, and the United States have come into focus. While the war has been a tragedy for Ukraine and Ukrainians, it has also proven a disaster for Russia militarily, economically, and geopolitically. The war has badly damaged Russias military and tarnished its reputation, disrupted the economy, and profoundly altered the geopolitical picture facing Moscow in Europe. It will make any near-term restoration of a degree of normalcy in U.S.-Russian relations difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.\n\nPoor leadership, poor tactics, poor logistics, and underwhelming performance against a smaller and less well-armed foe have left Russias military reputation in a shambles. That will have an impact. Over the past decade, Russian weapons exporters saw their share of global arms exports drop by 26%. Countries looking to buy weapons likely will begin to turn elsewhere, given that Russias military failed to dominate early in the war, when its largely modernized forces faced a Ukrainian military armed mainly with aging Soviet-era equipment (that began to change only in the summer, when stocks of heavy weapons began arriving from the West).\n\nAs a result of these losses, Russia has had to draw on reserves, including T-64 tanks first produced nearly 50 years ago. It reportedly has turned to tanks from Belarus to replenish its losses. To augment its own munitions, Russia has had to purchase attack drones from Iran and artillery shells from North Korea . As the Russian military has drawn down stocks of surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missiles, it has used S-300 anti-aircraft missiles against ground targets. The Russian defense budget will need years to replace what the military has lost or otherwise expended in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian military has lost significant amounts of equipment. The Oryx website reports 8,000 pieces of equipment destroyed, damaged, abandoned, or captured, including some 1,500 tanks, 700 armored fighting vehicles, and 1,700 infantry fighting vehicles. Oryx advises that its numbers significantly understate the true nature of Russian losses, as it counts only equipment for which it has unique photo or videographic evidence of its fate. Others report much heavier losses. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin commented that the Russian military had lost \"staggering\" numbers of tanks and other armored vehicles, adding that Western trade restrictions on microchips would inhibit production of replacements.\n\nIn November, Milley put the number of dead and wounded Russian soldiers at 100,000, and that could fall on the low side. A Pentagon official said in early August Russian casualties numbered 70,000-80,000. That was more than three months ago, and those months have shown no kindness to the Russian army. Reports suggest that newly-mobilized and ill-trained Russian units have been decimated in combat.\n\nWhile a tragedy for Ukraine, Putins decision to go to war has also proven a disaster for Russia. The Russian military has suffered significant personnel and military losses. Economic sanctions imposed by the EU, United States, United Kingdom, and other Western countries have pushed the Russian economy into recession and threaten longer-term impacts, including on the countrys critical energy sector.\n\nThe Kremlin has sought since the end of the Soviet Union to keep Ukraine bound in a Russian sphere of influence. From that perspective, the last nine years of Russian policy have been an abysmal failure. Nothing has done more than that policy to push Ukraine away from Russia and toward the West, or to promote Ukrainian hostility toward Russia and Russians.\n\nAs for NATO, 10 alliance members have expressed support for a membership path for Ukraine, nine in central Europe plus Canada . Other allies have generally remained silent or noncommittal, reflecting the fact that many, while prepared to provide Ukraine financial and military assistance, are not prepared to go to war with Russia to defend Ukraine. Even though Kyiv cannot expect membership or a membership action plan any time soon, it will have continued NATO support in its fight against Russia and, once the war is over, help in building a modern and robust military to deter a Russian attack in the future.\n\nIronically for an invasion launched in part due to Kremlin concern that Ukraine was moving away from Russia and toward the West, the war has opened a previously closed path for Ukraines membership in the European Union (EU). For years, EU officials concluded agreements with Kyiv, including the 2014 EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. However, EU officials avoided language that would give Ukraine a membership perspective. In June, four months after Russias invasion, the European Council recognized Ukraines European perspective and gave it the status of candidate country. Kyiv will need years to meet the EUs standards, but it now has a membership perspective that it lacked for the first 30 years of its post-Soviet independence.\n\nIt will take years, if not decades, to overcome the enmity toward Russia and Russians engendered by the war. One Ukrainian journalist predicted last summer that, after the wars end, Ukraine would witness a nationwide effort to \"cancel\" Russian culture, e.g., towns and cities across the country would rename their Pushkin Squares. It has already begun; Odesa intends to dismantle its statue of Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in 1794.\n\nUkrainians have made clear their resolve to resist. A September Gallup poll reported 70% of Ukrainians determined to fight until victory over Russia. A mid-October Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll had 86% supporting the war and opposing negotiations with Russia, despite Russian missile attacks against Ukrainian cities.\n\nAll this has understandably affected Ukrainian attitudes. It has deepened the sense of Ukrainian national identity. An August poll showed 85% self-identifying as Ukrainian citizens as opposed to people of some region or ethnic minority; only 64% did so six months earlier before Russias invasion. The invasion has also imbued Ukrainians with a strongly negative view of Russia: The poll showed 92% holding a \"bad\" attitude regarding Russia as opposed to only 2% with a \"good\" attitude.\n\nBesides the human losses, the war has caused immense material damage. Estimates of the costs of rebuilding Ukraine run from $349 billion to $750 billion, and those appraisals date back to the summer. Finding those funds will not be easy, particularly as the war has resulted in a significant contraction of the Ukrainian economy; the World Bank expects the countrys gross domestic product to shrink by 35% this year.\n\nIn addition, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees placed the number of Ukrainians who have sought refuge outside of Ukraine at more than 7.8 million as of November 8. As of mid-November, the Russian attacks had caused an estimated 6.5 million more to become internally displaced persons within Ukraine.\n\nPutins war has been calamitous for Ukraine. The precise number of military and civilians casualties is unknown but substantial. The Office of the U.N. Commissioner for Human Rights estimated that, as of the end of October, some 6,500 Ukrainian civilians had been killed and another 10,000 injured. Those numbers almost certainly understate the reality. U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley on November 10 put the number of civilian dead at 40,000 and indicated that some 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed or wounded (Milley gave a similar number for Russian casualties, a topic addressed later in this paper).\n\nOf all the pieces of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union that Moscow lost when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, no part meant more to Russians than Ukraine. The two countries histories, cultures, languages, and religions were closely intertwined. When the author served at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv at the end of the 1990s, most Ukrainians held either a positive or ambivalent view regarding Russia. That has changed. Today, most Ukrainians regard Russia as an enemy.\n\nWhether the Ukrainian military can drive the Russians completely out or at least back to the lines as of February 23 is also unclear. Some military experts believe this is possible, including the full liberation of Donbas and Crimea. Others offer less optimistic projections. The U.S. intelligence community has forecast that the fighting could drag on and become a war of attrition.\n\nAfter nine months of fighting, the Russian military has shown itself incapable of seizing and holding a large part of Ukraine. While the wars outcome is uncertain, however the conflict ends, a sovereign and independent Ukrainian state will remain on the map of Europe. Moreover, it will be larger than the rump state that the Kremlin envisaged when it launched the February invasion.\n\nAs of late November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his government insisted on conditions that included Russian withdrawal from all Ukrainian territory (including Crimea and all of Donbas), compensation, and punishment for war crimes. While these are understandable demands given what Ukraine has gone through, achieving them would prove difficult. Still, Kyiv appeared confident that it could liberate more territory even as winter approached.\n\nDespite three months of battlefield setbacks, Moscow has shown no indication of readiness to negotiate seriously to end the war. Indeed, on September 30, Putin announced that Russia was annexing Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, even though Russian forces did not fully control that territory and consistently lost ground there in the following weeks. The Russian military made up for battlefield losses by increasing missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, aimed in particular at disrupting electric power and central heating.\n\nAs Russia went to war, its economy was largely stagnant; while it recorded a post-COVID-19 boost in 2021, average real income fell by 10% between 2013 and 2020. It will get worse. The West has applied a host of economic sanctions on the country. While the Russian Central Banks actions have mitigated the worst impacts, the Russian economy nevertheless contracted by 5% year-on-year compared to September 2021. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development expects Russias economy to contract by 3.9% in 2022 and 5.6% in 2023, and a confidential study supposedly done for the Kremlin projected an \"inertial\" case in which the economy bottomed out only in 2023 at 8.3% below 2021. One economist notes that the Wests cut-off of chips and microelectronics has devastated automobile, aircraft, and weapons production, with the output of cars falling by 90% between March and September; he expects a long run of stagnation.\n\nIn addition to coping with the loss of high-tech and other key imports, the Russian economy faces brain drain, particularly in the IT sector, that began in February as well as the departure of more than 1,000 Western companies. It also has a broader labor force challenge. The military has mobilized 300,000 men, and the September mobilization order prompted a new flood of Russians leaving the country, with more than 200,000 going to Kazakhstan. Some estimates suggest several hundred thousand others have fled to other countries. Taken together, that means something like three-quarters of a million men unavailable to work in the economy.\n\nRussia thus far has staved off harsher economic difficulties in part because of its oil and gas exports and high energy prices. High prices have partially offset the decline in volume of oil and gas exports. That may soon change, at least for oil. The EU banned the purchase of Russian crude oil beginning on December 5, and the West is prohibiting shipping Russian oil on Western-flagged tankers or insuring tankers that move Russian oil if the oil is sold above a certain price, now set at $60 per barrel. The price cap if it works as planned could cut sharply into the revenues that Russian oil exports generate. The cap will require that Russian exporters discount the price of oil that they sell; the higher the discount, the less revenue that will flow to Russia.\n\nWeaning Europe off of Russian gas poses a more difficult challenge, but EU countries have made progress by switching to imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Moreover, European companies have found ways to cut energy use; for example, 75% of German firms that use gas report that they have reduced gas consumption without having to cut production. EU countries face a much better energy picture this winter than anticipated several months ago. If Europe successfully ends its import of Russian piped natural gas, that will pose a major problem for Gazprom, Russias large gas exporter. Gazproms gas exports move largely by pipeline, and Gazproms gas pipeline structure is oriented primarily toward moving gas from the western Siberian and Yamal gas fields to Europe. New pipelines would be needed to switch the flow of that gas to Asia. If Europe can kick the Russian gas habit, Gazprom will see a significant decline in its export volumes, unless it can build new pipelines to Asian markets and/or greatly expand its LNG export capacity, all of which will be expensive.\n\nA further problem facing Russias energy sector is that, as existing oil and gas fields are depleted, Russian energy companies must develop new fields to sustain production levels. Many of the potential new fields are in the Arctic region or off-shore and will require billions likely, tens of billions of dollars of investment. Russian energy companies, however, will not be able to count on Western energy companies for technical expertise, technology, or capital. That will hinder future production of oil and gas, as current fields become exhausted.\n\nAnother potential economic cost looms. The West has frozen more than $300 billion in Russian Central Bank reserves. As damages in Ukraine mount, pressure will grow to seize some or all of these assets for a Ukraine reconstruction fund. Western governments thus far show little enthusiasm for the idea. That said, it is difficult to see how they could turn to their taxpayers for money to assist Ukraines rebuilding while leaving the Russian Central Bank funds intact and/or releasing those funds back to Russia.\n\nWestern sanctions did not produce the quick crash in the ruble or the broader Russian economy that some expected. However, their impact could mean a stagnant economy in the longer term, and they threaten to cause particular problems in the energy sector and other sectors that depend on high-tech inputs imported from the West. Moscow does not appear to have handy answers to these problems.\n\nChanged geopolitics in Europe\n\nIn 2021, Moscow saw a West that was divided and preoccupied with domestic politics. The United States was recovering from four years of the Trump presidency, post-Brexit politics in Britain remained tumultuous, Germany faced September elections to choose the first chancellor in 16 years not named Angela Merkel, and France had a presidential election in early 2022. That likely affected Putins decision to launch his February invasion. In the event, NATO and the EU responded quickly and in a unified manner, and the invasion has prompted a dramatic reordering of the geopolitical scene in Europe. European countries have come to see Russia in a threatening light, reminiscent of how they viewed the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. NATOs June 2022 summit statement was all about deterrence and defense with regard to Russia, with none of earlier summits language on areas of cooperation.\n\nFew things epitomize the change more than the Zeitenwende (turning-point) in German policy. In the days following the Russian invasion, Berlin agreed to sanctions on Russian banks that few expected the Germans to approve, reversed a long-standing ban on exporting weapons to conflict zones in order to provide arms to Ukraine, established a 100-billion-euro ($110 billion) fund for its own rearmament, and announced the purchase of American dual-capable F-35 fighters to sustain the German Air Forces nuclear delivery role. Just days before the assault, the German government said it would stop certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Berlins follow-up has been bumpy and, at times, seemingly half-hearted, which has frustrated many of its partners. Still, in a few short weeks in late February and early March, German Chancellor Olaf Scholzs coalition government erased five decades of German engagement with Moscow.\n\nOther NATO members have also accelerated their defense spending. According to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, European allies and Canada have boosted defense spending by a total of $350 billion compared to levels in 2014, when the alliance following Russias seizure of Crimea set the goal for each member of 2% of gross domestic product devoted to defense by 2024. Stoltenberg added that nine members had met the 2% goal while 10 others intended to do so by 2024. Poland plans to raise its defense spending to 3% next year, and other allies have suggested the 3% target as well.\n\nMoscow did not like the small multinational battlegroups that NATO deployed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland beginning in 2017. Each numbered some 1,000-1,500 troops (battalion-sized) and were described as \"tripwire\" forces. Since February, NATO has deployed additional battlegroups in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Slovakia and decided on a more robust forward presence, including brigade-sized units, while improving capabilities for reinforcement. The U.S. military presence in Europe and European waters has grown from 80,000 service personnel to 100,000 and includes deployment of two F-35 squadrons to Britain, more destroyers to be homeported in Spain, and a permanent headquarters unit in Poland.\n\nIn addition to larger troop deployments, the Baltic Sea has seen a geopolitical earthquake. Finland and Sweden, which long pursued policies of neutrality, applied to join NATO in May and completed accession protocols in July. They have significant military capabilities. Their accession to the alliance, expected in early 2023, will make the Baltic Sea effectively a NATO lake, leaving Russia with just limited access from the end of the Gulf of Finland and its Kaliningrad exclave.\n\nIn early 2014, NATO deployed virtually no ground combat forces in countries that had joined the alliance after 1997. That began changing after Russias seizure of Crimea. The recent invasion has further energized NATO and resulted in its enlargement by two additional members. As Russia has drawn down forces opposite NATO countries (and Finland) in order to deploy them to Ukraine, the NATO military presence on Russias western flank has increased.\n\nThe Kremlin has waged a two-front war this year, fighting on the battlefield against Ukraine while seeking to undermine Western financial and military support for Kyiv. The Russians are losing on both fronts.\n\nThe Kremlin has waged a two-front war this year, fighting on the battlefield against Ukraine while seeking to undermine Western financial and military support for Kyiv. The Russians are losing on both fronts. The Russian military has been losing ground to the Ukrainian army and has carried out a campaign of missile strikes against power, heat, and water utilities in the country, which threatens a humanitarian crisis. Much will depend on how bad the winter is, but Ukrainians have shown remarkable resilience in restoring utilities, and the Russian attacks could further harden their resolve. Moreover, the brutality of the Russian missile campaign has already led Ukraines Western supporters to provide Kyiv more sophisticated air defenses, and pressures could grow to provide other weapons as well.\n\nAs for the second front, despite high energy prices, having to house the majority of the nearly eight million Ukrainians who have left their country, and concerns over how long the fighting might last, European support for Ukraine has not slackened. Russian hints of nuclear escalation caused concern but did not weaken European support for Ukraine, and Moscow has markedly deescalated the nuclear rhetoric in recent weeks. Given Russias relationship with China, the Kremlin certainly noticed Chinese President Xi Jinpings recent criticism of nuclear threats.\n\nIt appears Moscows influence elsewhere is slipping, including among post-Soviet states. Kazakhstan has boosted its defense spending by more than 50%. In June, on a stage with Putin in St. Petersburg, its president pointedly declined to follow Russias lead in recognizing the so-called Luhansk and Donetsk \"peoples republics\" as independent states. Neither Kazakhstan nor any other member of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) or any other post-Soviet state, for that matter has recognized Russias claimed annexations of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. In a remarkable scene at an October Russia-Central Asia summit, Tajikistans President Emomali Rahmon openly challenged Putin for his lack of respect for Central Asian countries. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan spoiled a late November CSTO summit; he refused to sign a leaders declaration and noticeably moved away from Putin during the summit photo op.\n\nMore broadly, in October, the U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution calling for rejection and demanding reversal of Moscows illegal annexation of the Ukrainian oblasts by a vote of 143-5 (35 abstaining). A recent article documented how Russia has found its candidates rejected and its participation suspended in a string of U.N. organizations, including the International Telecommunications Union, Human Rights Council, Economic and Social Council, and International Civil Aviation Organization. Putin chose not to attend the November G-20 summit in Bali, likely reflecting his expectation that other leaders would have snubbed him and refused to meet bilaterally, as well as the criticism he would have encountered in multilateral sessions. The summit produced a leaders declaration that, while noting \"other views,\" leveled a harsh critique at Moscow for its war on Ukraine.\n\nA deep freeze with Washington\n\nWhile U.S.-Russian relations had fallen to a post-Cold War low point in 2020, the June 2021 summit that U.S. President Joe Biden held with Putin gave a modest positive impulse to the relationship. U.S. and Russian officials that fall broadened bilateral diplomatic contacts and gave a positive assessment to the strategic stability dialogue, terming the exchanges \"intensive and substantive.\" Moreover, Washington saw a possible drop-off in malicious cyber activity originating from Russia. However, the Russian invasion prompted a deep freeze in the relationship, and Washington made clear that business as usual was off the table.\n\nU.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, and CIA Director Bill Burns nevertheless have kept channels open to their Russian counterparts. These lines of communication seek to avoid miscalculation particularly miscalculation that could lead to a direct U.S.-Russia or NATO-Russia clash and reduce risk. But other channels remain largely unused. Burnss November 14 meeting with Sergey Naryshkin, head of the Russian external intelligence service, was the most senior face-to-face meeting between U.S. and Russian officials in nine months. Biden and Putin have not spoken directly with one another since February, and that relationship seems irretrievably broken.\n\nIn a positive glimmer, Biden told the U.N. General Assembly \"No matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures.\" Speaking in June, the Kremlin spokesperson said \"we are interested [in such talks] Such talks are necessary.\" U.S. officials have privately indicated that, while they have prerequisites for resuming the strategic dialogue, progress on ending the Russia-Ukraine war is not one of them. This leaves room for some hope that, despite their current adversarial relationship, Washington and Moscow may still share an interest in containing their competition in nuclear arms.\n\nBeyond that, however, it is difficult to see much prospect for movement toward a degree of normalcy in the broader U.S.-Russia relationship. With Moscow turning to Iran and North Korea for weapons, Washington cannot count on Russian help in trying to bring Tehran back into the nuclear deal (the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) or to increase pressure on North Korea to end its missile launches and not to conduct another nuclear test. Likewise, coordination on Syria is less likely. It may well be that any meaningful improvement in the overall bilateral relationship requires Putins departure from the Kremlin. A second requirement could be that Putins successor adopt policy changes to demonstrate that Russia is altering course and prepared to live in peace with its neighbors.\n\nWhat happens will depend on how the Russian elite and public view his performance; while some signs of disaffection over the war have emerged, it is too early to forecast their meaning for Putins political longevity.\n\nThis does not mean to advocate a policy of regime change in Russia. That is beyond U.S. capabilities, especially given the opacity of todays Kremlin. U.S. policy should remain one of seeking a change in policy, not regime. That said, the prospects for improving U.S.-Russian relations appear slim while Putin remains in charge. What happens will depend on how the Russian elite and public view his performance; while some signs of disaffection over the war have emerged, it is too early to forecast their meaning for Putins political longevity.\n\nStill, while it remains difficult to predict the outcome of the war or the impact it may have on Putins time in the Kremlin, there is little doubt that the fighting with Ukraine and its ramifications will leave Russia diminished in significant ways. It must contend with a badly-damaged military that will take years to reconstitute; years of likely economic stagnation cut off from key high-tech imports; a potentially worsening situation with regard to energy exports and future production; an alarmed, alienated, and rearming Europe; and a growing political isolation that will leave Moscow even more dependent on its relationship with China. Putin still seems to cling to his desire of \"regaining\" part of Ukraine, which he considers \"historic Russian land.\" But the costs of that for Russia mount by the day.",

Pool photo by Mikhail Metzel\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia warned on Wednesday that the fighting in Ukraine would be protracted, while attempting to allay the worst fears of an increasingly war-weary population.\n\nSpeaking at a televised meeting Mr. Putin said the war in Ukraine \"might be a long process,\" moving further from Kremlins blitzkrieg rhetoric at the start of the invasion.\n\nBut he added that, for now, he would not call up more combat troops to serve in what his government calls a \"special military operation\" beyond the 300,000 drafted in September.\n\n\"In these conditions, the talk about some additional mobilization efforts make no sense,\" the Russian leader said. \"There is no need for this for the state and for the Defense Ministry.\"\n\nMr. Putins comments, made to the Kremlins human rights council a group of loyal journalists, activists and public figures came after brazen drone attacks by Ukrainian armed forces on targets in the Russian hinterland.\n\nThose attacks, combined with the conscription of hundreds of thousands of men to join the fighting ranks, have brought the reality of war closer to the attention of a largely apathetic Russian population.\n\n\"The people are getting tired, and Putin knows that a protracted war cannot be popular,\" said Abbas Gallyamov, a political scientist who once wrote speeches for Mr. Putin but has broken with him. \"He does not want a second wave of mobilization, and is trying to show that he has enough men to last through the winter.\"\n\nMr. Gallyamov said the Kremlin was betting that winter conditions would reduce the intensity of the fighting and that the conflict would settle into a war of attrition favoring Russia, as the reduction of Russian energy deliveries to Europe gradually erodes Western support for Ukraine.\n\nAt the human rights council meeting, Mr. Putin said that Russia had no choice but to intervene militarily in Ukraine in response to Western-backed aggression against ethnic Russians there, a claim the Kremlin has often made to justify the war.\n\nMr. Putin said that half of the 300,000 civilians conscripted to fight in Ukraine as part of a call-up announced in September were still training outside combat zones. About 77,000 conscripts are currently engaged in fighting in Ukraine, he said, and others are serving in territorial defense units or aiding training efforts.\n\nMr. Putin announced the \"partial mobilization\" of troops in late September after a series of setbacks on the battlefield, a move Western analysts said highlighted Russias disastrous losses of professional soldiers.\n\nThe decision shook Russian society. Thousands of Russians rushed to leave the country, some paying exorbitant prices for flights to whatever destinations they could manage to get tickets to.\n\nChaos and inefficiency hampered the mobilization. Many conscripts have reported that little training was provided and that whole units were left without commanders. Some complained that they had to buy their own equipment and uniforms.\n\nIn the face of criticism, Mr. Putin announced the end of the call-up in October, although he did not issue an official order to stop it. That has prompted fears that the Kremlin might announce another wave at any moment.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Putin appeared to acknowledge that the war, which began in February, is taking much longer that the Kremlin had expected. But he also said that Russia had become bigger by annexing Ukrainian territory.\n\n\"This is a significant result,\" Mr. Putin said, referring to his move in September to declare four Ukrainian provinces part of Russia, a move that has been condemned as illegal by Ukraine and its international allies.\n\nMr. Putin also played down the possibility of using nuclear weapons, despite his veiled threat in the past that they were an option in Ukraine. He said that even though the threat of a nuclear war \"is growing,\" Russia \"is not crazy,\" and the Kremlin was not going to \"brandish these nuclear weapons like a razor.\"",

                "cc_text": "Image Source: Ukrainian Government\n\nOver the course of twenty years, three lead actors, and two reboots, one thing has remained consistent for the immensely popular Spider-Man film franchise: the iconic maxim that, \"With great power, comes great responsibility.\" Both for the titular hero and his real-world audience, this quote is a sage testament to the burden of enlightened leadership, effective decision-making, and a sound moral compass that must accompany all positions of power.\n\nUnfortunately, in the international arena, this quote does not ring true. Throughout history, great powers have repeatedly made terrible strategic blunders that have precipitated significant consequences for both their power and global stability. Today, as US adversaries like Russia and China succumb to the hubris of their leaders and overreach for the first time in decades, the United States must relearn the art of \"bloodletting,\" thereby exacerbating and capitalizing on adversaries strategic mistakes, punishing their aggression, and bolstering international security. For if there is one thing that policymakers can count on in this uncertain era of geopolitical multipolarity, it is that with great power, comes a great aptitude for stupidity.\n\nHistory has not been kind to irresponsible leaders and their aggressive gambits for regional hegemony. Indeed, the historical record is littered with failed great powers that chose to overextend themselves at critical moments in their competition with major adversaries, sometimes sealing their own fates in the process. In an ancient account well-known among scholars and practitioners of international relations, much of Thucydides History of the Peloponnesian War is oriented toward exploring the causes and effects of the disastrous Athenian expedition to Sicily from 415 to 413 BCE. In an attempt to defend their ally Egesta from Syracuse, the Athenians wasted precious army, naval, and financial resources in Sicily, while their primary enemy Sparta dealt a devastating blow to Athenian power in Hellaseventually culminating in Athens defeat in 404 BCE. In modern history, this mistake has been repeated time and again. Over a century apart, Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler both invaded Russia at the height of their power, rather than focus on more immediate enemies only for the calamitous loss in blood and treasure to effectively end their respective bids for European hegemony, while creating the popular warning against invading Russia in the winter. And more recently, the Vietnam War and Soviet-Afghan War served as testaments to the often poorly chosen proxy conflicts of the Cold War, bearing detrimental consequences for the two dueling superpowers.\n\nAfter the Cold War, at the height of Americas \"unipolar moment,\" the U.S. failed to escape this historical great-power trend. The War on Terror led US policymakers to initiate costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which precipitated higher than expected casualties, sparked public backlash, and damaged US credibility among friends and foes alike. Indeed, over the last two decades, a resurging wave of autocrats have opportunistically leveraged these US missteps to target democracy, primarily through strategic messaging about democracys vulnerabilities and its apparent proclivities for serious mistakes and instability. While US administrations that rotate every four to eight years have struggled to produce sound, stable, and consistent foreign policy, autocrats like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping have appeared to be playing \"three-dimensional chess\" over long strategic horizons. Thus, US foreign policy mistakes and overreaches at the height of American power have often aided in promoting this unique 21st century brand of authoritarianism, which thrives on the veneer of competence and stability at the expense of democracy.\n\nToday, however, the unipolar moment is over. The international system is witnessing the return of geopolitical multipolarity, in which multiple states have the will and capability to contend for spheres of influence at the expense of each other. This poses the new problem of \"strategic simultaneity,\" by which US policymakers must compete with numerous, formidable autocratic and revisionist challengersranging from China and Russia to North Korea and Iranas well as violent extremist organizations and terrorist networks, all at the same time. Unlike the Cold War or post-Cold War periods, the United States will not have the luxury of balancing against a single superpower or a variety of lesser threats, respectively. While US President Joe Bidens recent National Defense Strategy seeks \"to develop, combine, and coordinate our strengths to maximum effect\" in order to counter todays multipolar challenges, primarily through the concept of \"integrated deterrence,\" it will be impossible to deter every threat simultaneously. The emerging international system will be more dangerous and prone to aggression than at any time since World War II.\n\nHowever, the reemergence of multipolarity bears a silver lining: the return of great-power hubris. The U.S. is no longer the only country powerful enough to commit immense strategic blunders, as it was during its unipolar moment. Adversaries like Russia and China are increasingly just as capable of overreaching in their attempt to overturn the balance of power, secure major advantages, and pursue their revisionist interests. And, as evidenced by the extensive academic literature on the disadvantages and vulnerabilities of authoritarian regimes, particularly in the realm of foreign policy and military security, many of these adversaries will be even more prone to such self-destructive behavior due to the lack of checks and balances constraining autocratic executive power. This is increasingly evident in the cases of a resurgent Russia and a rising China today.\n\nRussias 2022 invasion of Ukraine is the perfect example of a major strategic blunder. A year ago, the Eastern European security landscape appeared to be right where Putin wanted it. Post-Soviet frozen conflicts and the 2014 annexation of Crimea allowed Russia to pursue a sphere of influence in its near abroad, while NATO countries remained divided over how to respond to Russian disinformation operations and nuclear threats. However, Putin was too impatient to fully exploit this advantageous situation. Armed with poor information by advisors who are often \"too afraid to tell him the truth\"an enduring weakness of authoritarian regimeshe decided to invade Ukraine in February 2022, only to meet unmitigated strategic disaster. As of November 2022, the Kremlin has likely suffered over 100,000 casualties, spent $82 billion on the war effort, and endured lasting economic damage due to Western sanctions, only to botch the logistical and operational prosecution of the war. Against all odds, Ukraine has heretofore survived and even launched counteroffensives to retake segments of its territory, with many analysts now believing that there is a path to victory for Ukraine. The result is a total reversion of Russias prewar strategic gains. Sapped of relative military power, Russia will likely be a less menacing threat to NATO in the near future. As articulated by US Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl, \"Russia will emerge from this war weaker than it went in.\"\n\nChina under Xi Jinping has not yet endured a similarly epic catastrophe of its own making, but there are several indications of current or future overreach. Beijings ambitious attempt to expand its influence through its Belt and Road Initiative global infrastructure projects has largely backfired, as many poorer countries are struggling to repay their debts, thereby undermining the economic prospects of the initiative while validating the Wests criticism of Chinas debt-trap diplomacy. Meanwhile, domestic developments like Beijings failure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, its aggressive Zero-COVID policy, and human rights concerns over its exploitation of Uighurs have degraded international perceptions of China, which can hurt its future foreign policy and military gambits. Lastly, Xis aggressive marginalization of political opposition will likely eliminate checks on his authority, leaving China more vulnerable to the potentially disastrous consequences of his hubris.\n\nThus, the return of great-power hubris is evident, and it has significant policy implications for the United States. US policymakers need to relearn the art of \"bloodletting\"a term coined by international relations theorist John Mearsheimer to describe a strategy \"by which a country increases the costs to its rival by making a conflict in which that rival is involved more difficult.\" It is certainly possible that adversaries blunders will undermine their power entirely on their own, but bloodletting strategies can transform an adversarys blunder into a disaster, while signaling to all revisionist powers that the costs of such aggression will be exorbitantly high. Moreover, bloodletting allows a state to wage a proxy conflict at very little cost to itself (while increasing the adversarys costs), thereby undermining an adversary without spilling much blood and treasure. Bloodletting is certainly not new for the U.S.indeed, US policymakers pursued these strategies vis--vis the Soviet Union during the Cold War, including by supporting the Afghan mujahideen in their fight against the Soviet invaders during the Soviet-Afghan War. However, like the Spider-Man movies, this strategy needs a reboot for the 21st century. Today, it is essential to update the United States bloodletting playbook by undertaking the following three initiatives.\n\nFirst, the Department of Defense should improve its ability to deliver key weaponry to allies and partners under attack. Security cooperation with Ukraine has been an essential driver of Ukraines battlefield success, thereby exacerbating Russias logistical and operational blunders. But this is not a perfect system. Western fears of Russian escalationeither through increased civilian targeting or the threat of nuclear coercionas well as anxieties about military technology falling into Russian hands, have likely prevented the U.S. from sending more, and more sophisticated, weapons to Ukraine. Moreover, due to the rapid and sustained use of these weapons, the war has raised concerns about the arsenal depth of certain US capabilities. As Ukraine pleads for more aid, and as other allies and partners increasingly request US military capabilities like High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems and Stinger missiles to deter and defend against adversarial aggression, the U.S. must improve its defense security cooperation enterprise. This should entail a variety of complementary policy initiatives by President Biden and subsequent administrations, including: working with the defense-industrial base to expand production lines of key capabilities; bolstering security cooperation mechanisms to ensure more rapid transfer of arms to countries like Ukraine and potentially Taiwan in wartime; and building bipartisan consensus around security cooperation as a key tenet of low-cost bloodletting, in order to ensure a sustained national will to deliver such capabilities even in the face of escalatory threats.\n\nSecond, the Department of State should reinforce strategic messages about democratic strengths and authoritarian weaknesses. For too long, Russia and China have leveraged US mistakes to demonstrate their alleged autocratic superiority relative to unruly and unstable democracies, thereby drawing aspiring autocrats in other countries to their camp. However, the disastrous Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has precipitated significant consequences for the Kremlins credibility and stability, is an opportunity for US policymakers to go on the offensive in the information and diplomatic domains. State Department officials and others involved in strategic messaging can use this conflict to build a narrative about the weaknesses of authoritarianism, primarily by arguing that unconstrained dictatorships are even more prone to disaster than democracies protected by constitutional checks and balances. This will further increase the costs of aggression for Russia and China, as other states may drift away from the recently emerging bloc of authoritarian states.\n\nLastly, the White House should systematically learn from history in order to avoid future US strategic blunders and prevent adversaries from using bloodletting strategies against the U.S. While autocratic states are more prone to such mistakes, the U.S. has certainly conducted disastrous overreaches in the past. An institutionalized body of historians in the White House is long overdue, but, regardless of the specific mechanism, a more comprehensive approach to historical learning can help leaders make better decisions.\n\nThe United States and its allies and partners should not rejoice in, nor hope for, disastrous military blunders by their autocratic adversaries. As evident in Ukraine, the human and economic costs of these decisions can be utterly appalling, and it would have been far better to deter them in the first place. But in geopolitical multipolarity, it is simply impossible to deter every aggressive gambit by revisionist powers. Therefore, US policymakers should learn how to exploit adversaries hubris and demonstrate the costs of their aggression, establishing a precedent of bloodletting that will deter them from such action in the future. For with great power, comes a great responsibility to punish your enemies stupidity.",

                "cc_text": "00:00\n\nJust take a step back. President Biden has chosen Emmanuel Macron as the first foreign leader to have an official state visit. What is the significance of something like that? Well, thank you for having me on, Alex. And it's hard to believe that this is actually the first state visit of the current administration that, in fact, Mark Crumpton was also the first visit for the former administration of President Donald Trump. And it really gives us a sense of where the U.S. French relationship is, but also a window into the broader E.U. U.S. relationship. If we rewind time just a little bit, too, just last year, even the transatlantic relationship was really in an uncertain place. I would've been at Chatham House over the last few years. And I can assure you there was a lot of hand-wringing, hand-wringing and wondering around where was the transatlantic relationship. And then, of course, last fall we had that moment where the August partnership announced where ISE, which came with Australia, terminating a French submarine contract. But then now we had this year the Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And really a key trend that we've seen this year has been around unity within Europe and unity between the U.S. and Europe. And that's really what we're seeing here with this invitation to have Macron represent the first state visit. And IBEX, a key question as we look ahead to 2023 is how well does that unity hang together in the face of this exacting cost, of this conflict, in the face of the exacting costs of this war for Europe itself, but also with knock on effects globally? And we're hearing, of course, that something that President Macron wants to discuss with Biden, the Biden administration talks and even does does it many or micro represent France on this trip or Europe? A bit of both. He certainly is is not afraid to bring a message when he travels. We've seen this before when it came to 20, 19 and his messaging around NATO brain death and this time we're hearing about concerns around the IRA. That's certainly something that he has heard recently from meetings with French industrialists. But this concern around the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, is also a European wide. He's representing appears to be representing a European position around concerns of perhaps increased U.S. government interventionism, perhaps even increase perceived increase protectionism in the auto sector space, which is a key, of course, sector for France as well as Europe. So it feels like many of macron has the most to win or lose by this meeting. What is President Biden want to win with here? Like would be a win for him to go back to Congress and say, look at how great I was. President Biden is certainly looking to maintain that unity. There has been in recent weeks conversations or increasing noise around diplomatic diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. The U.S. has said very clearly that that is a decision for Ukraine to take under the conditions that Ukraine has put forward, including around territorial integrity, including further guarantees that Russia would not pursue a fraught fall on engagement invasion. And we've heard, of course, that President Macron is at for his side that perhaps in closed door session that he's more open to diplomatic route. So just really preserving that unity in the face of these economic costs that are. Shows Michelle, the president of the European Council in China today. I love Schulz, the German chancellor was there only a week or so ago. What message do you think President Biden is going to give President Macron to take back to Europe? Is it? You guys have got to figure out what your relationship is with China. You've already made a mistake over Russia. Don't make it again with China. The message that Biden wants to put forward and we saw this yesterday with Macron just visiting NASA with Vice President Harris, is that there are going to be cross cutting challenges ahead and we need to stay unified on those, whether it's everything from climate change, making the energy transition, pandemics, inequities, outer space, as we saw yesterday, that the U.S. and Europe need to remain aligned in that partnership as they have with the war in Ukraine this year. Is that all possible? It just feels like we're threading the line between perfection, right, where you can be aggressive, where you need to be aggressive, but friends, where you need to be friends and advocate for yourself when you advocate for yourself, but still remain friends. How do you do all of that? I mean, without some kind of subsidies for chips and for E.D. and battery makers from Europe, it feels like in some ways you're able continue to be at a severe disadvantage here. As you say, Alex McCord is certainly coming here to to raise the message around this. The IRA and and efforts in that act to sort of incentivize the US Eevee industry. Biden himself has said it's intending to make the US a hub for the global market and Mark Gurman will be looking for some sort of exemptions. We don't think there's going to be a relocation of the IRA. That's law. But we could be looking for some sort of subsidies, exemptions, licenses for Europe, as we've seen in the past, around tariffs under prior administration. So there will be a conversation to be had and we're not expecting that there's going to be a zero sum game or a hard line here. But I take your point and in fact, we've been raising about exactly this point. The world is becoming fluid and flexible in which countries are competing in certain spheres and contesting in others and in some cases their allies in certain spheres and in some places they're contesting in other spheres. How different do you think this visit would be if it was the German chancellor rather than the French president? They're different individuals, so surely there would have been different messaging. But if we look at the key issues at hand, which are principally around Russia, Ukraine, principally around the future of. One would call government invention ism, perhaps protectionism with the IRA. We think really that the trend line here is that economic security and national security are just just becoming increasingly interdependent. Despite these messages so dependent. So regardless of who would have come, the this is the trend line that the U.S. and others are likely to continue to pursue more rather than less so.",

But when she became a union safety representative around 2007, she started to pay attention.\n\nIn certain parts of the plant, \"you would see it all the time,\" she said. \"You definitely breathed it in.\"\n\nSix other people who worked in the plant, some with experiences as recent as this year, echoed her recollections about exposure to the potent mineral that has long been known to cause deadly cancers like mesothelioma and a chronic lung condition called asbestosis that can make it difficult to breathe.\n\ntoggle caption Rich-Joseph Facun for ProPublica\n\nThough designated asbestos workers were given protective gear and had special training, electricians, millwrights and general maintenance staff got no comparable protection even though they, too, were exposed, they told ProPublica. The same was true of some contract workers.\n\nCarrie Jenkins, a longtime contract janitor, said she scraped dry asbestos off the locker room floor and threw away workers' protective suits, which were sometimes caked with the substance. She said she was offered no protective gear herself, and worked around asbestos even when she was pregnant. \"They never told us how dangerous it was,\" she said.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive their biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAndy Lang, a contract pipe fitter, worked in the asbestos-ridden part of the plant without protective gear on and off from the late 1990s to 2019, he said. Asbestos would go \"flying\" and land everywhere; anyone who spent time there would have breathed it in, he said, including him. \"Ain't no doubt in my mind,\" he told ProPublica.\n\nThough he has not experienced lung problems, his sister did. A plant employee who worked a variety of jobs, Bertha Reed spent time in areas where workers handled asbestos, Lang said, retiring as a lab analyst.\n\nShe was diagnosed with lung cancer and died in 2017 at 64. An avid hunter and fisherwoman who loved to travel and shop, she left behind a husband, two children and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Reed never smoked cigarettes, her brother said. He blames the chemicals she was exposed to at the plant. \"There was nothing safe about it,\" he said.\n\ntoggle caption Rich-Joseph Facun for ProPublica\n\nFor decades, workers were largely silent about the dangers they faced in asbestos-dependent chlorine plants like the one near McIntosh. But in the weeks since ProPublica revealed unsafe practices at a plant in Niagara Falls, New York, people who worked at other chlorine plants across the United States have voiced concerns about the way asbestos was handled at their facilities. One former engineer at a plant outside Las Vegas said the substance was difficult to control. Former lab analysts at a Texas plant said colleagues there raised issues about potential exposures with safety managers in 2018.\n\nThe workers are speaking up as the country's two main chlorine producers, Olin and OxyChem, battle to continue using asbestos at their plants, despite proposed bans on the substance put forward by the Environmental Protection Agency and members of Congress. The workers' accounts undermine the companies' long-standing contention that the substance is used safely and that workers are seldom exposed.\n\nOlin did not return calls or emails from ProPublica. While CEO Scott Sutton told shareholders that the McIntosh plant recently stopped using asbestos, two of its other plants still use it, federal records show. OxyChem, which runs five asbestos-reliant plants, told ProPublica that it prioritizes worker safety and that its facilities are \"operated under high standards and strict regulatory controls.\" It did not respond to specific concerns that former workers raised about its plants.\n\nDo you work with hazardous chemicals? Share your story. Pro Publica and NPR are reporting on the impact of dangerous chemicals like asbestos in American workplaces. Tell us about your experiences with these substances.\n\nBut Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, a Democrat from Oregon, said it was \"deeply troubling that workers from multiple chlor-alkali facilities are now coming forward with stories of dangerous exposure to asbestos at their workplaces.\"\n\nSaid U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat: \"It's more clear than ever [that] we can't just trust industry to self-regulate itself with something as dangerous as asbestos. While it breaks my heart to hear of more workers in more plants that lack adequate safety precautions, it adds momentum to our mission to ban all forms of asbestos.\"\n\nPressure washing asbestos off screens\n\nAsbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that was once used widely in construction and industrial operations. In recent years, dozens of countries have deemed the mineral so dangerous that they've banned its use entirely. The United States doesn't allow asbestos mining, but it has no prohibition on importing asbestos. Olin and OxyChem are among the few companies that buy it from other countries and use it in domestic plants.\n\nThe material is a key part of the production process in the nation's oldest chlorine plants; it serves as a protective coating on large metal screens that sit inside tanks of corrosive chemicals. When a screen needs to be re-coated, workers pressure-wash the old asbestos off, then dip the screen into an asbestos slurry. They bake the new asbestos onto the screen before returning it to service.\n\nIn interviews, more than two dozen people who worked at asbestos-dependent plants across the country described the process as dirty and outdated. (Both Olin and OxyChem have newer plants that make chlorine without asbestos, but the companies have resisted updating all of their facilities, saying the upgrades are cost prohibitive and would not significantly improve worker health.)\n\ntoggle caption Rich-Joseph Facun for ProPublica\n\nOlin opened its plant near McIntosh, a small town about 40 miles north of Mobile, in the 1950s. The ground there is rich in salt, a key ingredient in chlorine manufacturing. The plant's early production process involved mercury, a toxic metal that went on to contaminate the groundwater, EPA records show. It started using asbestos in 1978.\n\nThe plant has a complicated relationship with the residents of McIntosh, many of whom are Black or Native American and whose families have lived there for generations. At least three times in the past three years, the plant has released chlorine into the atmosphere, government records show. Scores of residents are now suing Olin, alleging in court documents that the plant failed to warn them about the leaks and they suffered as a result. The company denies those claims, and the case is ongoing.\n\nStill, Olin is a major employer in McIntosh and supports the local schools and community improvement association. The corporation's name and logo loom large around town, adorning even the local walking trail. Many residents are reluctant to criticize the company publicly.\n\nInside the plant, workers struggled to keep the asbestos contained, according to the seven people who worked there. They were told they could stay safe by keeping the material wet, preventing it from becoming airborne. But that was an impossible task, several of them told ProPublica.\n\nA slight breeze would cause the asbestos to dry, said Chris Murphy, a former union president who worked in the maintenance department from 2009 until 2020. It wasn't unusual to find it settled on machines and caked onto the beams overhead, he said. \"Any areas that didn't stay wet,\" he said, \"you'd find it.\"\n\nAsbestos was just one of many hazards at the plant; more immediately concerning was a possible explosion or hazardous gas leak. Still, the plant's safety managers discussed it regularly and scrubbed the asbestos area in preparation for regulator inspections, said Caster, the former union safety representative who worked at the plant until 2020.\n\nFor years, plant officials knew when to expect the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In 2001, the plant won admission into OSHA's Star Program, which exempts facilities that commit to high safety standards from random, unannounced inspections. Instead, OSHA makes re-evaluation visits every three to five years. The McIntosh plant withdrew from the program in 2015, several months after a chlorine release sent an employee to the hospital and OSHA fined the company $8,500, government records show.\n\nIn a statement provided after this story was published, OSHA said it had inspected the plant seven times after its withdrawal from the program, mostly on account of chlorine exposures, and that its records did not indicate any problems with asbestos hazards.\n\n\"Although the procedures for on-site evaluations are designed to reveal possible safety and health management failures, OSHA cannot rule out breaches in health and safety management when we're not onsite,\" an agency spokesperson said.\n\nTracking asbestos into the lab on their boots\n\nAt OxyChem's chlorine plant outside of Corpus Christi, Texas, workers in the lab started asking questions of their own in 2018, multiple former employees told ProPublica. Among their other duties, the lab workers analyzed asbestos samples delivered to them by workers who handled the material. The lab employees feared the asbestos workers were inadvertently carrying the substance into the lab on their boots and protective suits, which they often wore around their waists.\n\nPeople in the lab also worried that, once dry, tiny fibers from the samples could escape into the air. The lab employees did not have protective breathing devices known as respirators.\n\nWhen one of them raised concerns, the plant's safety managers sampled the air quality and deemed it safe, the former employees said. But the results did little to convince some employees that there was no exposure risk.\n\nTeresa Hunt was in charge of the asbestos training program and air-quality sampling at OxyChem's plant in Tacoma, Washington, from the 1990s until 2001 just before it stopped making chlorine in 2002. (From 1997 to 2002, the facility was owned by Pioneer Companies, news clips show.) The plant tried to control the asbestos with special fans, Hunt said, but they weren't enough. \"Most people of course they were exposed to it,\" she said. \"The stuff was all around us.\"\n\nThe plant offered top-of-the-line respirators to workers, Hunt said, but few employees took the threat of asbestos exposure seriously. \"As a teacher, I had trouble getting them to listen to me,\" she said, echoing the reality that the other threats at the plant felt more imminent.\n\nHunt said she has not seen a high incidence of cancers among former plant workers, many of whom are still in close contact. Lately, though, she has been trying to get her insurance to cover a lung X-ray to look for signs of asbestos-related damage. \"My God, I worry about it,\" she said.\n\nControlling the asbestos was also a challenge at Olin's plant in Henderson, Nevada, said Dawn Henry, the plant's engineer from 2004 through 2010. Although the asbestos workers at the facility outside Las Vegas wore personal protective equipment during the most dangerous tasks and supervisors tried to enforce the safety standards, \"you can only do so much,\" she said. \"It is a messy job.\"\n\nIn the desert heat, Henry said, it was impossible to expect all the asbestos would stay wet. \"It wasn't like it was in a clean room,\" she added. \"It was in a room that was open to the atmosphere. The building was adjacent to the offices where the engineers worked. It was a one-minute walk away. The garage door was always open.\"\n\nOlin, which acquired the Henderson plant from Pioneer in 2007, announced plans to stop making chlorine there in 2016. The facility now produces bleach and hydrochloric acid, according to the company's website.\n\nThe accounts from workers stand in sharp contrast to what Olin and OxyChem have put on the record about worker safety in their plants. For decades, they've said their workers are rarely exposed to asbestos. The argument has been key to their success in beating back previous bans proposed by the EPA and Congress.\n\n\"Everyone makes the argument that this is a problem of the past, we do things better now,\" said Columbia University historian David Rosner, who researches the harm done by industrial pollution. \"This has been the historical argument, the legal argument and the way of putting off the inevitable, which is the need to ban this stuff.\"\n\ntoggle caption Rich-Joseph Facun for Pro Publica\n\nThe EPA recently used the companies' own exposure-monitoring data to help determine that workers at chlorine plants including those who don't handle asbestos were at an unreasonable risk of being hurt by it, using the finding as the basis for the agency's latest proposed ban.\n\nBreathing troubles in a retired worker\n\nAnd in October, ProPublica examined the conditions at the OxyChem plant in Niagara Falls. Former workers there said asbestos stuck to the ceiling and walls, contaminated their break room and drifted out of open doors and windows before the plant closed late last year.\n\nAfter the story was published in collaboration with NPR, other former employees at the Niagara Falls plant said they, too, had been exposed to asbestos. Ronald Hulsizer Sr. repaired pumps and instruments in the building where the material was handled. There was asbestos dust everywhere, he said, adding that it sometimes blew into an adjacent building.\n\nJohn Mountain said he worked around asbestos until he retired from the Niagara Falls plant in 2013. He now has trouble breathing, he said. His doctors have told him his lungs are seriously damaged. Mountain used to smoke cigarettes; people who work around asbestos and smoke face a much higher risk of asbestos-related disease than those who don't.\n\nBut he didn't know that when he was a young man. In fact, his bosses told him the opposite, he said. \"They used to tell us if you smoked, the asbestos didn't bother us as bad,\" he said.\n\nMountain said he was recently back at the plant, doing contract work to help decommission it. There's still a lot of asbestos on the site, he told ProPublica. \"They have to get rid of all of the cells,\" he said, referencing the large tanks where chlorine was made. \"You can see [asbestos] on the outside of them.\"\n\nIn the month and a half since ProPublica's reporting was published, some advocates have called on the EPA to expedite its latest proposed ban, which will likely take several months to be finalized. Others have rallied behind an effort to pass a law banning asbestos, which would be more difficult for opponents to overturn in court than an EPA rule. Five House members have signed on to co-sponsor the bill in recent weeks.\n\nIt is unlikely that the bill will be considered during the current lame-duck session before the new Congress begins in January. But advocates plan to keep the pressure on, said Linda Reinstein, co-founder of the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization. Her group recently sent a letter to the EPA that cited ProPublica's work and urged the agency to dig deeper into the companies' ongoing use of asbestos.\n\n\"The brave workers who shared their stories prove yet again that there is no safe or controlled use of asbestos,\" she told ProPublica. \"The scourge of asbestos death and disease will be with us for decades to come unless Congress acts now to ban this chemical once and for all.\"\n\nPhotography by Rich-Joseph Facun.",

                "cc_text": "The Russian oil \"price cap,\" which Group of Seven (G7) countries have been promising for some time in response to Russias war in Ukraine, is finally becoming a reality. Last week, the US Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) published a determination to pursue the cap, along with detailed guidance for market actors. On Fridayafter an extended period of hagglingEuropean Union (EU) ambassadors reportedly signed off on an initial fixed cap of sixty dollars per barrel. Other participating members in the price cap will also have to sign off in the coming days.\n\nWhen we first looked at the debate in June, Secretary Janet Yellens Treasury was a strong proponent, but the EU was skeptical. By October, the EU had become a strong advocate and included in its eighth package of sanctions a promise to implement the cap before the EU ban on seaborne imports of Russian oil comes into effect on December 5.\n\nA senior US team was in Brussels two weeks ago to iron things out. The fact that details as fundamental as the level of the cap are being agreed so close to the deadline betrays the extent to which conversations have been heated. Contracts on shipments that will arrive after December 5 have already been signed, and we hear the cap will only apply to shipments which are \"loaded\" after the date.\n\nAs implementation of the price caps finally gets under way, we will get answers to three critical questions:\n\n1. How will the price cap work? And will it work?\n\nThe cap prevents firms in participating countries from providing shipping, insurance, and other services including trading and brokering to shipments of Russian crude oil that are sold above a certain per-barrel price, in this case sixty dollars. In practice, the onus will be on these providers to ask their clients for proof that they have bought at a cap-compliant price.\n\nOFACs guidance shows some regard for the fact that shipping and insurance firms may not have complete information about how much their clients pay for each shipment. It calls upon them to request attestations that the cap has been respected via simple, and already standard, contract provisions. Firms that are requesting these (and have no reason to believe they are false) arent likely to face enforcement actions. This approach does give OFAC and its counterparts the authority to pursue whoever may have lied in an attestation, for instance by making a separate transaction above the cap.\n\nFor now, the cap isnt as low as some would wish. Russian oil is already trading at a discount: about sixty-nine dollars per barrel compared to eighty-six dollars for Brent crude.\n\nSome EU member states were pushing for a much lower capone which would remove Russias ability to turn a profit. They obtained a slight drop from a proposed sixty-five-to-seventy dollars to a (reportedly) final level of sixty. Even this was enough to generate concerns over implementation from the US Treasury.\n\nAt sixty dollars Russia would still turn a strong profit. The much-discussed Chinese and Indian buyers the measure is designed to affect would simply use the cap in their negotiating tactics. When the stakes are low, it isnt worth circumventing Western (especially European) firms hold on the shipping and insurance markets. If it were, Iran and Venezuela would have had an easier time exporting their oil in recent years.\n\nWe also think there will be opportunities for cheating, especially if the price difference between Russian-made Urals crude and Brent crude increases.\n\nHistory has shown that it is possible for the shipping industry to misrepresent or obscure the origin of its cargo. Meanwhile, exemptions for certain pieces of the Russian production complex (notably the Sakhalin-2 project, which was heavily funded by Japan) suggests that there will be \"un-capped\" Russian barrels still floating into the market. The cap doesnt fully address blends that include Russian crudes (perhaps intentionally), suggesting that there may be additional opportunities to maneuver Russian barrels through refined or partially refined products. Finally, it will be difficult for countries enforcing the cap to truly track the price paid, given the markets opacity.\n\nThe primary onus for compliance is placed on the unregulated brokers and traders of Russian oil products. The crucial test of this policys viability will lie in enforcement of the cap when breaches inevitably happen. OFAC has threatened cheaters with consequences, but taking action against them may well chill participation by other participants in the scheme and further undermine the dual policy goals of keeping Russian product on the market but cutting revenues for Moscow.\n\n2. What kind of global impact can we expect?\n\nWashington, Brussels, and other capitals will be judged on whether we see Russias export revenue decline without prices at the pump at home increasing too much. As long as these two conditions are fulfilled, it doesnt matter whether the cap is the decisive factor.\n\nFor now, the cap is not significantly below the price of Russian crude, so its not clear how Moscow will respond. Indeed, Russian President Vladimir Putin has just approved an increase in production. Assuming most of Russias supply remains on the market, the effect on prices will be small.\n\nShould global prices increase and the cap force Russia to accept an even higher discount, we do expect Moscow to respond by selling less. The question is whether this is a little less or whether most of Russias supply becomes temporarily unavailable. Prices are well down from their July peak. This is mainly due to the risk of a G7 recession, but it is also true that engagement from the governments behind the price cap has reassured market participants. We had initially feared that additional layers of complexity would add tension to the market and result in higher prices.\n\nHowever, the cap also becomes harder to enforce if prices increase and stay high. Between a sixty-dollar cap and an eighty-six-dollar Brent price, it may not be worth taking the risk of being fined and Russian revenues will be down compared to 2022 anyway. But the temptation will grow with the market price.\n\nWhile G7 governments decided that a floating cap was too complicated, participating countries can always decide to move the fixed cap by committee. The cap could be moved down if G7 governments believe that enforcement is working. It could also be moved up.\n\n3. What kind of impact can we expect on the Russian economy?\n\nRussias export revenues have fallen since the record-breaking second quarter of 2022, due to lower oil prices and lower volumes of gas sold. The second factorlower volumesis partly due to Russias decision to reduce gas flows into Europe.\n\nConsequently, the Russian government is already struggling to finance the increasing costs of its war in Ukraine and day-to-day spending (some of which is indexed to inflation). The latest budget foresees deficit spending in 2022 and for the three years to come. Initially, the gap was meant to be filled by transfers from the National Welfare Fund, which receives some of the oil and gas export income every year. But the government has now turned to borrowing on domestic markets.\n\nThe outlook is certainly bleak. Perhaps bleak enough to argue that Russia needs its oil revenue and will therefore continue to sell, even if the cap becomes more of a constraint than it will be to start with.\n\nReed Blakemore is the deputy director of the Atlantic Councils Global Energy Center.\n\nCharles Lichfield is the deputy director of the Councils GeoEconomics Center.\n\nBrian OToole is a nonresident senior fellow at the GeoEconomics Center and a former senior adviser to the director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the US Department of the Treasury.\n\nFurther reading\n\nImage: The gas compressor station, a part of Polish section of the Yamal pipeline that links Russia with western Europe which is owned by a joint venture of Gazprom and PGNiG but it is operated by Poland's state-owned gas transmission company Gaz-System, is seen in Gabinek near Wloclawek, Poland on May 23, 2022.

In other words, one in every 78 persons on this planet is displaced.\n\nThe number89.3 millionworrying though it may be, does not tell the whole story. A closer look offers a different appreciation of what it means. For instance, of the 89.3 million, 27.1 million are recognized as refugees as defined (narrowly) by the 1951 Refugee Convention. A far greater number, 53.2 million, are internally displaced. Many of these are internally displaced as a result of having to flee persecution, which may well trigger recognition by the Refugee Convention, but given they have not crossed an international border, they cannot seek international protection. A significant number, 4.6 million, are asylum-seekers. The ongoing developments in Venezuela, producing the largest displacement crisis in the Americas today, have already resulted in 4.4 million of its citizens seeking sanctuary abroad.\n\nDisplacement as a result of persecution based on race, religion, ethnicity, membership in a social group, or having a political opinionthe 1951 Refugee Conventions definition of who is a refugeeis certainly a significant cause for the large numbers of people who are fleeing today. But globally, there remain far fewer protections and recognition for those who flee domestic and/or gender-based violence; non-state criminal gangs and armed groups; and those displaced as a result of a complex confluence of endemic corruption, generalized violence, development-based displacement, and drone warfare and military occupations. The vast majority of these people are and will remain, internally displaced. Despite the current frenzy around \"climate migrants,\" which focuses on them as an international issue of management and security concerns, the vast majority of those displaced by the climate crisis in conjunction with other interwoven political and economic crises will also remain within the borders of their own countries, continuing to necessitate innovative thinking around urban infrastructure and complex issues of social and economic cohesion.\n\nBy May 2022, there were 100 million forcibly displaced people in the world. While the Russian invasion of Ukraine has contributed to this increase, the intense focus on this crisis, especially in the West, has paid little attention to some of the most severe displacement crises unfolding currentlyin Eritrea, the Central African Republic, Somalia, South Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria, and among the Rohingya.\n\nPaying attention to the numbers ultimately offers at best an overview of the scale of displacement without delving deeper into the complex reasons why people are forced to flee and where they can and cannot find safety. It does not draw adequate attention to arguably an even bigger crisis, generated by the intensification of border militarization in response to the successful conflation of displaced peoples with criminality and terrorism and the lucrative security business that accompanies it, and that of the politics of reception, which remains highly selective in its offer of sanctuary for those who can manage, despite the efforts at deterrence in many instances, to cross an international border.\n\nSubmitted by Tazreena Sajjad",

Tripoli-based advisory High Council of State (HCS) Chair Khalid al-Meshri 14 Nov accused militiamen affiliated with Tripoli-based PM Abdelhamid Dabaiba of \"besieging\" HCS headquarters; said HCS had convened session to follow up on tentative agreement with eastern-based legislature House of Representatives (HoR) to work toward forming new unity govt. Dabaiba, who is opposed to HoR-HSC negotiations, immediately denounced \"incitement and exaggeration\", saying only \"a few\" protesters had gathered outside HCS building, accused Meshri of making secret \"power-sharing\" deals to delay elections. HoR Speaker Aguila Saleh same day condemned \"threats and intimidation by armed groups using force\" against HCS. Dabaiba 29 Nov reportedly accused Meshri and Saleh of \"systematically obstructing elections\". East-based military commander Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar around 22 Nov weighed in on political crisis, saying \"time has come for the Libyan people to put an end to failed experiments and dead ends\", accusing politicians of \"worshipping their seats of power\".\n\nGreek FMs refusal to meet Tripoli-based govt minister sparked diplomatic spat. After Tripoli-based Govt of National Unity (GNU) in Oct signed deal with Trkyie on oil and gas exploration in areas of Mediterranean contested by Athens, Greek FM Nikos Dendias 17 Nov canceled Tripoli visit upon landing to avoid being welcomed by his Libyan counterpart, FM Najla al-Mangoush; Dendias claimed he had come to meet Tripoli-based Presidential Council head Mohamed al-Menfi. GNU subsequently recalled its ambassador from Athens and summoned Greek charg daffaires in Tripoli.\n\nIn other important developments. In his briefing to UN Security Council, UN sec-gens special representative for Libya, Abdoulaye Bathily, 15 Nov renewed call for legislative and presidential elections but did not articulate how he planned to address sources of friction over electoral roadmap.

                "cc_text": "LINDSAY:\n\nWelcome to The President's Inbox, a CFR podcast about the foreign policy challenges facing the United States. I'm Jim Lindsay, director of Studies at the Council in Foreign Relations. This week's topic is the war in Ukraine.\n\nWith me to discuss where the fighting in Ukraine is headed as winter looms are Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage. Liana is a fellow for Europe in CFR's Europe program. She's the author of Germany's Role in European Russia Policy: A New German Power? Michael is a professor of history at the Catholic University of America and a senior associate at the Center for Strategic in International Studies. From 2014 to 2016, he served on the policy planning staff at the U.S. State Department where he held the Russia Ukraine portfolio. His latest book is The Abandonment of the West: The History of an Idea in American Foreign Policy.\n\nLiana and Michael have written a half dozen pieces for Foreign Affairs over the past year on various aspects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Foreign Affairs has bundled these pieces under the heading of The Ukraine Scenarios. Recently, Foreign Affairs published their piece, \"Go Slow on Crimea: Why Ukraine Should Not Rush to Retake the Peninsula.\" Liana and Michael, thank you to you both for coming back on The President's Inbox.\n\nFIX:\n\nThank you, Jim.\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nThank you so much for having us.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nMichael, I'd like to start with you and ask you to give us an update on the war, as things currently stand. We know that back in September, the Ukrainians launched a surprise offensive in the northeastern portion of the country, that was quite successful, led to the liberation of Kharkiv. Last month, Ukrainian forces retook Kherson in the southeastern portion of the country. Kherson is the only regional capital that Russian forces had taken during the war. So where is the fighting taking place now?\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nWell, the weather has gotten quite cold, so the pace of fighting on the ground has slowed, but there were a couple of attacks within Russia itself, which I assume are attributable to Ukraine. Even if that may be a little bit murky. I think the winter's going to witness some back and forth, but it's probably not until the spring with the lines will really begin to change again. But I think stalemate would be the wrong word for where we are because the tension is still very high and the missile strikes in both directions. Russia's missile strikes on Ukraine's critical infrastructure and Ukraine's strikes in various places are going to be ongoing. And on both sides, they have the potential to further destabilize the conflict. So it's a pause of a sorts, but definitely not a stalemate.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nSo let me draw you out on that point about strikes behind Russian lines because for the most part, the fighting has been concentrated on Ukrainian territory, but recently the Ukrainians we believe are responsible for attacks including attacks on a Russian military base, I believe more than 300 miles from the Ukrainian border. Are these significant or are they just merely symbolic in terms of the actual course of fighting?\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nI don't think that they've changed fundamentally Russia's capacities, but in a war of images, which this war very much is, I think that they are psychologically quite significant. First of all, they're humiliating to Russia, which seems to be struggling to prevent them, and I think it does send a message. One of them was not far from Moscow at all, that Russians need to be on notice. I don't think that Ukraine is going to go after Russian civilians at any point, so that's not the objective. But it is unsettling on the Russian side and just further indication that Russia's going to have a very, very hard time containing this war. But in terms of Russia's capacity to wreak havoc, I don't think that they're going to alter that calculus.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nLiana, I want to bring it into the conversation now if I may. And I'm curious about one thing at the top, which is who is doing the fighting for Russia right now? Obviously President Putin initiated this partial mobilization that was designed to get fresh conscripts to the front with perhaps very little or no training, but there's also been a lot of talk about mercenaries doing the fighting. Do we have a sense of who's bearing the brunt of it on the Russian side?\n\nFIX:\n\nWell, we have some indications perhaps if we look first on the leadership level there. We had an interesting change in Russia strategy because for the first time we had a general, General Surovikin who had a history of being involved in brutal warfare in Syria, become a prominent figure for the war. And it seems that he has changed some of washer's calculus. So he is in charge of these missile attacks on Ukraine. He is also responsible for fortifying the south so that Ukraine will have difficulties advancing further south of Kherson towards Crimea. And he seems to be the first general that the Russian leadership is willing to present in public. When it comes to the soldiers level, we have those mobilized, the mobics as they are called, but they obviously are used very much as canon fodder in this war. There are several pieces of evidence, several phone calls that have been intercepted, which show that the moral, the training, that those troops get is less than ideal.\n\nAnd we also have the Wagner Group by Prigozhin who are at the moment fighting in Bakhmut, which is a curious case because the city of Bakhmut in Ukraine is a city which doesn't seem to be of high strategic relevance, but we see that apparently there during the day, it's Russian soldiers fighting, during the night, it's Wagner mercenaries fighting. One last thought about the mercenaries: it's interesting that the public profile has been raised. So they have a headquarter now, a very shiny, flashy headquarter. So it's not anymore this kind of shadow mercenary army that it was, it's much more prominent in Russia's war strategy and also in the perception of the German public. And so is also the head of the Wagner Group, Prigozhin who has put out a couple of videos where he presents himself as the one who is able to motivate Russian forces and to bring successes to Putin.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nDo we know where these mercenaries come from? Are they primarily people who have been fighting in Syria? Are they from Africa, Latin America, Asia?\n\nFIX:\n\nWell, those mercenaries at the beginning were partly from missions in Northern Africa, from Syria, but we've also seen a new effort by Prigozhin the leader to recruit Russian convicts. They have been prominent videos where he tries to motivate Russian convicts to sign up, and he even promises those convicts that they would leave prison forever if they managed to fight in Ukraine to the satisfaction. That's not something which is covered in any legal way by Russian law. Just to pardon someone because he's willing to fight in Ukraine is outside of any rule of law structure that one can still speak of in Russia, but that's what the Wagner Groups are at the moment where they're recruiting the soldiers from.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nMichael, I want to talk about the piece that you and Liana wrote contemplating a potential Ukrainian attack on Crimea. And I'm curious, are we at the point, given that fighting is continuing in the Donbas, the Ukrainians are not making the kind of progress they had made earlier on. I take it that winter is coming, but are we near the point where the Ukrainians might decide to invade Crimea or is that still something down the road and depends upon actually liberating Donbas first?\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nWell, there have been statements to the effect that the Ukrainian military would like to do this. I don't know if that means anything is imminent. The river around Kherson is a natural barrier. And it does look like the Russians have dug into a considerable extent around Crimea. It's a very formidable challenge in many ways and could likely be one that the Ukrainian military will put off for quite a while. But that said, Ukrainian military has faced formidable challenges since the beginning of the war, has done remarkable things continuously, the battle of Kyiv, the battle of Chernigov, and then of course, as you've mentioned already Kharkiv and Kherson. And so what's within the capacities of the Ukrainian military, I wouldn't want to underestimate those capacities. And then of course, in terms of missile strikes, Ukraine has just moved a lot closer territorially to Crimea. I think that the way that you could describe it as within range, perhaps a winter attack would have the element of surprise and that a sense it might have considerable appeal.\n\nMy guess is it's down the road, but I would think through as Liana and I tried to do in the piece, be thinking through contingencies where this could start quite quickly.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nLet me just ask a quick question is I'm not really sure that climate... does the Dnieper River freeze over? Were we relevant to be able to cross easily or is this a case of you would even winter have to pursue some sort of amphibious operation?\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nI don't myself know, perhaps you do Liana, in terms of whether the river freezes. It's very, very wide at many points. I think-\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nI'm looking at it on a map, it looks pretty wide, but...\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nKilometer or a mile length. I think the logistics, whether it's frozen or not, are pretty extreme in terms of crossing the river. And there's a lot of exposure that any army would experience in trying to cross. But I don't know if there's a ice element or dynamic in the winter months.\n\nFIX:\n\nI think the greater challenge is probably the lack of bridges, which Ukraine very deliberately has destroyed to make it more difficult for Russia. But now it is obviously a disadvantage to Ukraine that there are no bridges left that Ukraine can easily use and have to do an amphibious landing if they want to continue advancing on the other side of the Dnieper.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nWell, Michael, let me ask you a question about that because my sense in official Washington, my sense, but when I've talked to European officials that they're not comfortable with the idea of beginning ground operations in Crimea, they are worried that that will be, I can use the phrase, a bridge too far and that will change the course of the war and it will increase the chances of a catastrophic Russian response. How do you react to that talk?\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nI think that I have a similar impression, but the cardinal point that the United States and the European allies have made vis--vis Ukraine is that these are decisions for Ukraine to make, that Ukraine is not going to be dictated to. They're not going to be strategic choices that are made over the heads of the Ukrainians. And it's in the end for Ukraine to decide how to defend itself. And I think that that's a very sincere commitment on the part of Washington.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nCan I draw you out on that, Michael? Because it seems to me that while U.S. interests are aligned with Ukraine's, they are not necessarily identical. And the United States or Germany or France or Great Britain, EU writ large, could decide that liberating Crimea or seeking to simply raises a prohibitive risk to Europe writ large, maybe even the globe. And given that the United States and European countries are providing weapons, arms as well as financial humanitarian support to Ukraine, they have the wherewithal to shape influence the decisions Ukrainians make.\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nWell, I think that that's perfectly true, and I think the way that we try to square that circle in the piece is to say that there could be a vigorous conversation between Western capitals and Kyiv about this. And there's a range of options between deferring entirely to Kyiv and dictating to Kyiv what should be done. I think it's very legitimate to communicate priorities or communicate concerns and anxieties and have that be a part of the partnership that's really flourished between Ukraine and the West since the beginning of the war. But the other way in which I think we square that circle in the peace is to argue that it's really in Ukraine's interest to go slow when it comes to Crimea, that there may be other military objectives that are more useful at the moment. Certainly deterring Russia from attacks on Kyiv and the heartlands of the country makes a lot of sense and making advances in the Donbas may be sort of more prudent at the moment militarily. And it's just a way of building on all the successes that Ukraine has had.\n\nI think that there is a way of, in a sense, harmonizing Ukraine's interests with the interest of the West. But you're right, it's not effortless and there's going to be a bit of slippage there, and that's going to require careful diplomacy.\n\nFIX:\n\nAnd there's certainly an implicit comfort zone among Western countries, which is that the pre-invasion lines, the pre-February lines is something which everyone can agree upon. And if we look at the European map, the imaginary European map in a podcast, we do see divides among Europeans, central and eastern Europeans are much more in favor of Ukraine retaking its entire territory. Germany or France are uncomfortable with that prospect. So one argument that Michael and I made in this piece is also that to keep Western unity, which has been very much the success formula of Ukraine and the West in this war, it would be wise to go slow on Crimea.\n\nAnd also the big challenge that Ukraine has is to break up the land bridge to Crimea that Moscow has created, which would mean that Ukraine needs to drive a wedged down to Mariupol to the Sea of Azov, and this would help to separate Russia's troop in the south from the troops in the east. It would also help to prevent logistical lines and supply lines from the east coming into Crimea, especially as the Kerch Bridge is also vulnerable. So before Crimea comes into sight, there are many other objectives that Ukraine can achieve to put further pressure on Russia.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nI take your point, Liana, perhaps we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves and start talking about the liberation of Crimea. There's other fighting to be done. Let's bring us back to the present and the real question of what is the position that Vladimir Putin finds himself in today? Obviously there have been protests by Russians about the conduct of the war. Interestingly, some of those have been anti-war protests, but some of them have been from ultra nationalists who are convinced that the Kremlin hasn't fought the war either hard enough or smartly enough. And my sense is there's some growing public discontent about the cost of the war. Recently President Putin met with a handpicked selection of mothers of soldiers in Ukraine in which he in essence said, \"I feel your pain.\" Other times he didn't seem all that empathetic. I know at one point he said, let me quote him here, \"Some people die of vodka and their lives go unnoticed. But your son really lived and achieved his goal. He didn't die in vain,\" end quote. Maybe that sounds better in a Russian context, I can't say.\n\nBut can you just give us a sense of what sort of pressures Russian leader Putin is feeling, Liana?\n\nFIX:\n\nI mean, the remark that you just quoted obviously appears very cynical. What we see from Putin's recent remarks is that he seems to think that time is on his side. His recent remarks suggested that there's no immediate wave of mobilization, the second wave of mobilization coming, and he also spoke about a war which will still take a long time. He seems to be in a position where he doesn't want the upheaval that another wave of mobilization might cause and prepares the Russian public for a long war, a long drawn out war in Ukraine, which obviously Ukrainians and Zelenskyy don't want. And that seems to suggest that he is perhaps a little bit more in line with public opinion than he has been before because this kind of shock that Russians have experienced after the announcement of mobilization has really been a challenge. And this same kind of shock was there when Russia had to give up its positions in Ukraine around Karkiev and Kherson.\n\nSo the strategy at the moment seems to... Well, as we suggest on Crimea on the Russian side, to go slow on further mobilizations to prevent this kind of backlash in Russian domestic opinion.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nMichael, when we sat down in March to discuss Putin's choices in the war in Ukraine and we went through a variety of options. What is your assessment of how Putin's calculations have and have not changed? What is his endgame? How does he see Russia accomplishing what you take to be the goals he's set for himself?\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nI think that he probably hasn't accepted fully the reality of the situation, which is that at least in my view, the political goals that he set toward the beginning of the conflict are unrealizable. And in many ways the war that he's fighting is counterproductive for his own interests as he's defined them. It's going to create a Ukrainian polity that is largely unified and largely aligned with the West in some form or fashion, which is in a sense Putin's nightmare, and that's what he's sort of accomplishing on the ground. For his formal objectives and sincere objectives, I think he's in a terrible position and whether he fully sees that or not is anybody's guess. I mean, he's a canny man in some respects, but he also seems to have fallen victim to a very ideological view of the world. On the other hand, exactly as Liana said a moment ago, I think that he believes in a waiting game, he has certain options.\n\nAnd of course, the crossover to really going after Ukraine's critical infrastructure is a new development in the war. One that we didn't discuss last time, and Putin just affirmed in a video taken in the Kremlin that after the attack on the bridge over the Kerch Strait, it was his right to go after Ukrainian critical infrastructure. So he's almost bragging about that on television, and it is a significant development in the war. It's causing great inconveniences. It's a further burden on the Ukrainian economy and it's just going to make the war more difficult to prosecute, but it's not going to make the war any more winnable. We've used the word cynical, you might almost say nihilistic in this sense, a kind of nihilistic refusal to accept that the war that he has begun is a war that he cannot win.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nSo you don't think, Michael, that Putin's strategy here of inflicting pain on the Ukrainian public, taking out critical infrastructure in the middle of winter, so people lose lights, people lose heat, you don't think that's going to break Ukraine's will to fight?\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nI do not. I think that if we would use a historical analogy here, we might turn to two examples. The allied bombing of Germany, which has as far as we know, didn't break German support for Hitler. Perhaps it accomplished almost the opposite of strengthening the bond between the German population and the Nazi regime. But then you could also look at North Vietnam and the massive bombing campaigns that were conducted there, which devastated the economy of North Vietnam and civilian infrastructure, but in some ways enhanced the willingness of the North Vietnamese to fight. These are different kinds of wars of course, but I think the dynamic is really quite similar. How in the world is Ukraine going to yield to a antagonist that uses tactics of this kind? It doesn't make any sense on its surface. So the misery is going to be very real, it already is, and that will leave its traumatic effect on Ukrainian society for decades to come, but it's not going to solve any of Putin's fundamental military or political problems.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nWell, Liana, that raises the flip side of Putin's strategy, which is to break the will of the West, to fracture the West so that the West ceases to provide Ukraine with the materiel and economic support it needs to continue the war. There has been a lot of hand wringing over the last six months or so about the ability of the West to remain united in the face of Russian aggression. You've already alluded to some of the divisions that exist in Europe. Do you see the West fracturing?\n\nFIX:\n\nI'm very optimistic on this question. Putin's strategy is through these missile attacks to make Europe afraid of further refugee flows coming into Europe, and also to show Europe that reconstruction of Ukraine will be expensive. And it's true, I mean the costs are going up. The initial assessment was $350 billion, the reconstruction of Ukraine would cost. Now the estimates go between $500 and $600 billion by the World Bank. So obviously these are costs that are being raised, but we do not see a real change in Europe's position. And I speak for Europe here at the moment. We have new data that has just come out, which suggests that Europeans are catching up on U.S. support for Ukraine. There will be a big 18 billion Euro microfinancial assistance package for Ukraine next year after a period of slow contributions to Ukraine in the summer and early autumn. European countries are stepping up, Germany is stepping up, France is stepping up.\n\nAnd we also see in public opinion that on average 50% of the population in Europe does support weapon deliveries to Ukraine and they also support economic sanctions. There's some outliers, Greece, Hungary, Italy, for example. But the picture looks good in general. And I think on the U.S. side, the midterm elections have heard certainly increased the optimism that there will be no fundamental change in U.S. position if the $37 billion package Ukraine support is going through Congress, then the United States also has a firm basis to continue supporting Ukraine. I think at the moment I'm quite optimistic when it comes to the winter and also on the energy question for Europe. We will have to ask this question again next year when we're heading towards the summer next year and the war perhaps whisks to enter into its second and third year.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nOkay. Liana, I have to ask you about your native country Germany. Olaf Scholz has a piece in Foreign Affairs talking about a global Zeitenwende, this great pivot. But I've seen a lot of suggestions that while the Scholz government said all the right things back in the spring about taking military preparation seriously, about standing shoulder to shoulder with its NATO colleagues that the Germans have been, let's say, not delivering as much indeed as they have in word. Is that a fair assessment or is it missing something?\n\nFIX:\n\nPerhaps two points on that. The first is it was quite unfortunate that the day when the Foreign Affairs piece was published was also the day when the spokesperson of Olaf Scholz announced that Olaf Scholz will not, and the government will not be able to meet the 2 percent this year and might only be able to meet it in 2025.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nThis is referring to the pledge that all NATO countries made back in 2014 to devote at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product to defense spending?\n\nFIX:\n\nAbsolutely. And Germany has been lagging behind for a long time, has now committed a hundred billion to the German army, but obviously that's not good communications that you have to take back this pledge. Certainly if we look at the newest figures that have come out, Germany is contributing a major part to Ukraine and we have three more IRIS-T defense systems that will arrive in Ukraine. Germany is shouldering major parts of the financial contributions for Ukraine. So I do think it's unfair to say that Germany is not fulfilling its promises at all, but there is a lack of urgency. It is too slow what is happening. And Zeitenwende has also escaped the imagination by far. Zeitenwende was a response to the immediate outbreak of the war. When Olaf Scholz gave the speech, he thought that Ukraine will be occupied by Russia. It was three days after the war. So it was very much about European security.\n\nNow, especially also in this town, in Russia, Zeitenwende is a shorthand for this big geopolitical transformation of Germany, which obviously should also include China policy. And interestingly on China policy, there was really not a lot in this Foreign Affairs piece. I mean, it showed up somewhat towards the end of this piece. And basically Olaf Scholz was saying that we can have the cake and eat it, we can cooperate with China, but at the same time, China should also not have a sphere of influence. It is legitimate to ask whether Germany has really drawn the lessons from its failed Russia policy for China policy.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nWell, I will note that Chancellor Scholz did make a trip to Beijing, did meet with President Xi. Got a lot of criticism for that precisely because to his critics it appeared that he was in essence sticking to the pre-Ukraine policy of elevating trade and mercantile exchange, commercial exchange over geo strategic, geopolitical concerns.\n\nMichael, I'm wondering if you share Liana's optimism about solidarity in the West, particularly the commitment here in the United States to backing Ukraine. It is true that a number of Republicans and Democrats elected back in November support more aid for Ukraine. But my sense there's a concern around this town that there's a small group in the Republican Party, particularly in the House, Tea Party members to some extent, who are dead set against sending more aid to Ukraine. And given how narrow the margin is in the House of Representatives, they'll be able to block or gum up the works when it comes to providing additional support for Ukraine. How do you assess that?\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nI mean, I think that it will be a different environment when the new Congress takes shape in the coming year, and it won't be quite as conducive to getting things done as it has been for the last ten months. I don't foresee huge difficulties in that regard because I think that there are a lot of Republicans for the White House to work with. And it is also I think, important to measure Trump's political fortunes against this problem because obviously Trump is not a great fan of Ukraine and has this alternative viewpoint. But to the degree that that's weakening, and I think it is weakening to a degree, it's also something that's going to help the Biden administration to stay the course. But I wouldn't want to be too sanguine. I share Liana's optimism, but of the two of us, I'm always the more pessimistic ones, so let me be true to character.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nI'm trying to really play on the divisions between the two of you, so...\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nRight. Well, you incited my pessimism. What I have in mind with pessimism... well, not pessimism, but I think the challenge, the longer term challenge is not economic or military support for Ukraine. I think that that's going to be forthcoming for a long time and every time there's this inkling of Ukraine fatigue, I think Putin does something to just keep that support going, so there too, Putin is his own enemy. But I think on the diplomatic front it's going to be tricky because we really have not settled on an end game and there are lots of divergences, even-\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nCan I ask you just a second, Michael, when you say end game, what do you mean by that term?\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nWell, the terms on which we would accept an end to the war, how we foresee realistic possibilities when it comes to an end to the war. How long this is going to be going? Where we might be willing to compromise, if we're willing to compromise. It's all the series of unanswered questions, and there are nuanced differences between Paris and Berlin, nuanced differences between Berlin and Washington, but then of course they're the countries of eastern and central Europe, which have a much higher level of internal existential anxiety about this crisis. And a very different sense when you get the message there that Russia has to be rendered incapable of waging such a war again, which is not the view necessarily in Washington or-\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nWell, that gets you back to your point you made earlier, Michael, which is that Washington is reluctant, has said so publicly, to impose outcomes on Kyiv. It is in essence, at least rhetorically in public, taking its lead from Ukraine rather than telling Ukraine, \"This is where we're willing to go and no further.\" I'm not sure what's being said privately, but obviously this is a delicate diplomatic dance for the Biden administration, and I imagine for all of the other countries we're talking about. The Ukrainians want to be able to go as far as they can without going too far and alienating the very countries that are making it possible for them to fight this war against Russia.\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nI mean, I think that there are two dynamics that work with the Biden administration here. One is that they don't want to give Putin anything to work with, so they're not going to publicly, I think, go out in any way and express differences with Kyiv, and that's a perfectly sensible strategy. I think that the other dynamic at work, which is a bit more worrisome is that the Biden administration just doesn't know. They don't know what the answer to the question is, where is it going to end? Will Ukraine be a part of the European Union? Will it one day be a part of NATO? Is that the solution to the problem? Is this going to be a kind of Korea type conflict that could last for years or decades where there'll be two sides and a uneasy back and forth? I mean, I'm sure that there are preferences in the White House, but I think they just don't know where this ends up and that's difficult.\n\nIt's not the second World War in this regard, and there are difficulties that follow from it. But as a historian, I think back to the Cold War, we didn't know how the Cold War ended either, and there were different phases and chapters of the Cold War where it looked like it could go right in the direction of conflict. And there were phases when it looked in the 1970s that detente could win the day, and then everybody was deeply surprised by the actual outcome or end phase of the Cold War. It was much better than I think most had expected in the midst of the conflict. So maybe that's the frame that we need to use when you can't quite state your explicit path, you have to set priorities and keep to those priorities, then just see how the events break.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nLiana, Michael raises a really important point, and that is the question of how to think about a war that actually could go on for quite some time. Again, as you look at the fighting, there have been periods in which the Ukrainians made rapid progress. Right now, the fighting in the Donbas high intensity, but not a lot of movement. There's a possibility this fighting could go on for quite some time. And have you thought about how we should think about a war that doesn't end quickly? Because again, I think most of us coming to this starting back in February was, \"This should end relatively shortly,\" and it didn't. The Ukrainians held together, they have in essence played David to Russia's Goliath. They have retaken much of what the Russians took in the early spring, not all of it, but there's nothing that requires a war to end quickly. It could drag on. How do we think about that? That's a problem for Europe, I would imagine, to a significant degree.\n\nFIX:\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, I think we have an example, and that is very much the war that was waging in eastern Ukraine since 2014. I mean, 2022 is not the start of the war. We had heavy fighting in eastern Ukraine after 2014, and in the end we had sort of a boundary line between the troops, but the war was always simmering. And I think that's also the lessons that Ukrainians take from this period, that they do not want a repetition of this model. They do not want a repetition of a ceasefire, which just continues to simmer and to endanger Ukraine's possibilities to ever enter the European Union or even NATO with such a simmering conflict. But for me, the really crucial line, and I think I'm quite optimistic at the moment, but the crucial year for me, it's really 2024 because for the moment also the Western Alliance is in a good position.\n\nWe don't have major big elections coming up. The midterms are behind us. But in 2024, we will have elections in Ukraine, which will be a huge challenge if the war is still continuing. We have \"elections,\" in our so-called elections in Russia, which will pose the question of domestic challenges. We will have elections in the United States. I think at the moment there is still some time ahead that can be used to support Ukraine to make further advances, to support Ukraine with weapon system like Western made battle tanks to break up the land bridge to Crimea and so on. But once we enter into the second half of 2023, then the questions will become more serious about how long can this war go on, and how long can the West support Ukraine? So for me, 2024 will be a crucial year in many ways for Ukraine and for Russia and for the alliance.\n\nKIMMAGE:\n\nI will add for the record that if there were some who thought that the war would be short, that Foreign Affairs had the foresight to publish a piece titled \"What If the Word Doesn't End?\" And I'm proud to say that Liana and I were the co-author of that piece that was written over the summer. It's one of the scenarios that we've thought hard about.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nOkay, Dan Kurtz-Phelan, the editor of Foreign Affairs, is delighted that you have made that plug for what we now call the Ukraine scenarios. Can we get a little tease as to what the next entry is going to be?\n\nFIX:\n\nI can try to say something. I think Michael and I have tried in a longer piece for Foreign Affairs, which will come out at the beginning of next year to think about more about Russian domestic scenarios. So about scenarios, what if Russia is defeated, and what are different varieties of Russia defeats that one can think of, and what'll be the domestic implications of varieties of Russian defeat? I think Foreign Affairs would be happy if I encourage everyone to have a look into the next piece of Foreign Affairs.\n\nLINDSAY:\n\nWe'll wait until the piece comes out. I don't want to get you in trouble. On that note, I'll close up The President's Inbox for this week. My guests had been Liana Fix, a fellow for Europe here at the Council on Foreign Relations, and in Michael Kimmage, a professor of history at the Catholic University of America and a senior associate at the Center for Strategic International Studies.

A ruling by a state court judge placed Oregon's tough new voter-approved gun law on hold late Tuesday, just hours after a federal court judge allowed the ban on the sale and transfer of high-capacity magazines to take effect this week.\n\nThe ruling by Harney County Judge Robert Raschio threw the implementation of Measure 114 set for Thursday into limbo and Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said on Twitter that her office will urgently appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court. That filing is likely to come Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It's been a busy day for Measure 114, Oregon's new gun safety law, which is supposed to go into effect Thursday. A federal and a state judge both issued rulings today,\" the Twitter thread said. \"As of now, the law cannot go into effect on Thursday.\"\n\nThe lawsuit in Harney County, filed by Gun Owners of America Inc., the Gun Owners Foundation and several individual gun owners, sought to have the entire law placed on hold while its constitutionality is decided. The state lawsuit specifically makes the claims under the Oregon Constitution, not the U.S. Constitution and that means for now, Raschio's ruling is binding in the entire state.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a federal judge in Portland had delivered an initial victory to proponents of the sweeping gun-control measure narrowly approved by Oregon voters last month.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut allowed the ban on the sale and transfer of new high-capacity magazines to take effect Thursday. She also granted a 30-day delay before the law's permit-to-purchase mandate takes effect, but did not quash it entirely as gun rights advocates had wanted.\n\nMeasure 114 requires a permit, criminal background check, fingerprinting and hands-on training course for new firearms buyers. It also bans the sale, transfer or import of gun magazines over 10 rounds unless they are owned by law enforcement or a military member or were owned before the measure's passage. Those who already own high-capacity magazines can only possess them in their homes or use them at a firing range, in shooting competitions or for hunting as allowed by state law after the measure takes effect.\n\nGun sales and requests for background checks soared in the weeks since the measure was approved because of fears the new law would prevent or significantly delay the purchase of new firearms under the permitting system.\n\nMultiple gun rights groups, local sheriffs and gun store owners have sued, saying the law violates Americans' constitutional right to bear arms. All of those lawsuits were filed in federal courts except for the one in Harney County, a gun rights group said late Tuesday.\n\n\"We are, of course, deeply troubled by the ruling that came out of the Federal Court today. We are also grateful for the opposing ruling from the Harney County Judge this afternoon,\" the Oregon Firearms Federation wrote. \"But no matter what, there is a long way to go.\"\n\nThe interfaith coalition that placed Measure 114 on the ballot said earlier Tuesday it appreciated the federal judge's ruling and understood the need for a delay in the permit-to-purchase provision to sort out the process.\n\n\"We'd like to see the permitting in place this week because that would save lives, but at the same time we understand that it will take longer to do it well,\" said Mark Knutson, chairman of the Lift Every Voice Oregon campaign and pastor at Portland's Augustana Lutheran Church. \"For us, it's all about saving lives and safety.\"\n\nKnutson did not return a call late Tuesday about the state ruling.\n\nAmid the uncertainty, gun sales spiked in Oregon in the past month.\n\nThe Oregon State Police reported more than 35,000 pending background check transactions for gun purchases as of last week and was averaging 3,000 requests a day compared to less than 900 a day the week before Measure 114 passed, according to agency data. On Black Friday, the agency received 6,000 background check requests alone, OSP Capt. Kyle Kennedy said in an email.\n\nGun store owners also reported a run on guns, with sales in some stores increasing four- or five-fold in recent weeks.\n\nMeasure 114's fate is being carefully watched by both gun rights advocates and those who want stricter limits on gun ownership because it is one of the first to take effect after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that struck down a New York law that placed limits on carrying guns outside the home.\n\nThe June ruling signaled a shift in the way the nation's high court will evaluate Second Amendment infringement claims, with the Supreme Court's conservative majority finding judges should no longer consider whether the law serves public interests like enhancing public safety.\n\nInstead, judges should only weigh whether the law is \"consistent with the Second Amendment's text and historical understanding.\"\n\nGun-rights supporters have called the June ruling a \"wrecking ball\" for firearms restrictions. Since then, federal judges in Texas have struck down a law against adults under 21 carrying handguns and a ban on people under indictment buying firearms. Judges have also blocked measures in West Virginia, Delaware and Colorado.\n\nOther gun regulations have survived challenges since the ruling, however, including one involving ghost guns in California and one on non-violent felons owning guns in Pennsylvania.\n\nStill, the Supreme Court also sent back to a lower court for review a California ban on high-capacity magazines that's similar to Oregon's new law.",

                "cc_text": "Summary\n\nOn October 10, Victoria Amelina, a prize winning author, sent out a series of urgent tweets. \"Im in Kyiv and alive,\" she started off, explaining that she was filming Russian strikes on Kyiv as best as she could. She tweeted out a list of the buildings damaged or destroyed during the attack, including the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, the Khanenko Museum, Kyiv Picture Gallery, National Philharmonic of Ukraine, Maksymovych Scientific Library, and Kyiv City Teachers House. Her anguish at these losses and her understanding of why they had been targeted was crystal clear: \"I know they want us, Ukrainian writers, to disappear . . . they target Ukrainian culture.\"\n\nCulturepast, present, and futureis on the front lines of the brutal war on Ukraine and cultural erasure is a central tactic of Russias campaign of aggression and violence in Ukraine, which has gone on for over eight years. Russian President Vladimir Putins repeated false claims that a distinct Ukrainian history, language, and culture do not exist, serve as one of his central justifications for waging war on and occupying Ukraine. He seeks not only to control Ukrainian territory, but to erase Ukrainian culture and identity, and to impose Russian language, as well as a manipulated, chauvinistic, militaristic version of Russias culture, history, and worldview, on Ukrainian people.\n\nOleksandra Yakubenko, currently working on PEN Americas efforts to support Ukrainian artists at risk and an expert on Ukrainian culture, thinks that Putins efforts to destroy Ukrainian culture have had the opposite effect. She explained how her Ukrainian identity was \"reawakened\" in 2014 in the aftermath of the Maidan Revolution that ousted President Viktor Yanukovychwhat Ukrainians call the Revolution of Dignityand following Russias occupation of Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Since then, she noticed \"cultural life just bloomed and bloomed.\" She ascribed this strengthening, in part, to the vitality of Ukraines cultural sector and their participation in and support for democracy and human rights, and later the war effort. She now believes that \"our culture and our physical survival are intertwinedthey go hand in hand.\"\n\nIn an interview from July 2022, the Ukrainian novelist, poet, and essayist Yuri Andrukhovych shared similar views on Ukrainian culture and writing as a bulwark against Russian aggression: \"Its quite ironic that each attempt Russia has made to destroy Ukrainian culture has had the opposite effect . . . There is now a widespread tendency among Ukrainians to speak entirely in Ukrainian . . . New poems, novels, stories, essays, etc. will be written in Ukrainian, and of course they will be read and discussed. It is the best way to overcome the Russian aggressors and to survive in that humanitarian catastrophe they have brought upon us.\"\n\nRussia has carried out extensive, coordinated actions to marginalize, undermine, and ultimately eliminate the tangible and intangible manifestations of Ukrainian culture since its illegal occupation of Crimea, and parts of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russias actions, which included damaging important cultural buildings and undermining the teaching of and in Ukrainian in those territories, now serve as a blueprint for their cultural erasure efforts in areas they have invaded and occupied since the full-scale war against Ukraine began on February 24, 2022. They have been supplemented by physical destruction of cultural infrastructure on a massive scale.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Russian government has sought to destroy Ukrainian culture. Ukrainian thinkers, writers, linguists, artists, and scholars over the last three centuries have faced Imperial Russian and Soviet efforts to deny, assimilate, and eliminate their culture and language. Olesya Khromeychuk, a historian and director of the Ukrainian Institute in London, detailed efforts by various Russian tsars to eliminate Ukrainian culture, including banning Ukrainian-language publications, prohibiting cultural societies, and exiling or imprisoning public intellectuals. She explained that \"writers, poets, and artists became the figures who shaped national identity.\"\n\nDeliberate attacks on culture, including efforts to erase culture, by state and non-state actors, are not new. The bombing of Guernica, a Basque town in northern Spain, by the German air force in support of General Franco during the Spanish Civil War; the systematic destruction of Polish libraries and archives by the Nazis during World War II; attacks on cultural heritage sites, including Palmyra in Syria, by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are among the better-known efforts to destroy and erase culture during wars. In 2016, the International Criminal Court (ICC) handed down its first conviction of a war crime \"consisting in intentionally directing attacks against religious and historic buildings in Timbuktu, Mali.\"\n\nThe occupation and war have wrought an incalculable toll on Ukraines cultural voices, creators, and workers. They are amongst the thousands killed and injured by Russian attacks, or detained and threatened by Russian forces. Many have fled their homes and communities to reach safety; they have lost loved ones, homes, and precious possessions. They have been cut off from their creative communities and colleagues, and they have seen their studios, galleries, and exhibition spaces destroyed, damaged, and closed. The need to focus on survival has frequently taken precedence over creative work and even when Ukrainian culture is not being deliberately targeted, the war has deeply disrupted creative production.\n\nRussian bombardments and other attacks have destroyed and damaged hundreds of places where Ukrainians enjoy and experience culture, sites small and large, local and national, from community cultural houses to fine art museums. Some of these attacks were deliberate, targeted attacks, such as on Mariupols Academic Regional Drama Theater, which was sheltering hundreds of civilians, including children, when Russian aircraft dropped two bombs on it in March 2022. In the Kyiv region, in the first days of the Russian assault, a Russian missile struck the Ivankiv Historical and Local History Museum, setting it on fire, the only building in the village to be struck during that time.\n\nRussian forces have also repeatedly and indiscriminately attacked densely populated areas using explosive weapons and cluster bombs, which have been banned by an international treaty. These attacks have caused widespread death and injury, as well as massive destruction and damage to civilian infrastructure, including cultural heritage sites, book printing houses, libraries, and places of spiritual interest. The damage and destruction cannot be seen as simply incidental, collateral damage resulting from Russian military operations targeting Ukrainian military targets. Rather, the magnitude of the destruction suggests a deliberate campaign to destroy civilian infrastructure, rendering some cities barely habitable, and an attempt to destroy civilian morale.\n\nBoth the targeted and indiscriminate attacks carried out by the Russian military against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine are violations of International humanitarian law (IHL) and, per the findings of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, actions by Russian forces amount to war crimes. The conduct of Russias military and occupation forces also violates international human rights law, including Ukrainians right to culture.\n\nUkrainian writers, poets, artists, and cultural defenders demonstrate remarkable resilience and resistance in the face of this brutal conflict and attack against their Ukrainian culture. Many draw strength from their connections to Ukrainian culture and are actively seeking new ways to produce and promote culture. Writers are writing wartime diaries. There are literary readings in bookstores against the backdrop of air-raid sirens, and concerts in metro stations doubling as bomb shelters. \"Good Evening (Where Are You From?),\" also known by its popular name, \"Good evening, we are from Ukraine,\" is a song by the electronic duo ProBass and Hardi. It was released just before the start of the war, and it now plays in bomb shelters; the phrase is printed on T-shirts and trends on Twitter, and is often used by officials, including Vitaliy Kim, the governor of the southern region of Mykolaiv, when they address the Ukrainian people, signifying and strengthening Ukrainian resilience. Many believe that the survival of Ukraine as a country and people is inextricably linked with the survival of its culture, and they carry that burden with them. Tamara Shevchuk, a painter, graphic designer, and art teacher, works in a village in the Kyiv region that was occupied by the Russians for 24 days. She said: \"War does not spare anyone, and the cultural front is just as important as the military one.\"",

                "cc_text": "Ukraine war: Russia demands annexations recognised before talks\n\nBy Paul Kirby BBC News\n\nGetty Images\n\nPresident Putin illegally annexed four regions of Ukraine at the end of September while Russian forces were on the back foot\n\nRussia says the West's refusal to recognise \"new territories\" seized from Ukraine makes peace talks harder, after President Joe Biden indicated he would be ready to meet Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin said it was open to negotiations, but not on the West's demand to pull out of Ukraine.\n\nRussia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions at the end of September, without controlling any of them.\n\nNine months into its invasion, it has lost more than half the land it seized.\n\nPresident Biden told reporters on Thursday night that he was ready to meet the Russian leader \"if in fact there is an interest in him deciding that he's looking for a way to end the war\".\n\nStanding beside him in the White House, France's Emmanuel Macron made clear the two men had agreed they would never urge the Ukrainians to make a compromise \"that will not be acceptable for them\".\n\nThe apparent flurry of diplomatic activity followed months with little sign of enthusiasm for talks. Russia's military has been forced into a retreat in southern Ukraine while launching widespread attacks on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSHAWN THEW/EPA\n\nPresident Biden strongly caveated his remarks about potential talks with Russia's leader while standing beside the French president\n\nOn Friday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke to President Putin for the first time since September. During the hour-long call, Berlin said the German leader had urged his counterpart to find a diplomatic solution that involved pulling Russian troops out of Ukraine \"as soon as possible\".\n\nThe Kremlin said the German side had pushed for the call, and Mr Putin had urged Berlin to \"reconsider its approaches in the context of the Ukrainian events\". President Putin had drawn attention to the \"destructive line of Western states including Germany\" and Kyiv completely rejected the idea of talks, the Kremlin added.\n\nSpokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier that Mr Putin remained open to talks aimed \"to ensure our interests\". But Moscow was certainly not ready to accept US conditions: \"What did President Biden say in fact? He said that negotiations are possible only after Putin leaves Ukraine.\"\n\nIt complicated the search for a mutual basis for talks, he said, that the US did not recognise \"new territories\" in Ukraine. At the end of September, President Putin declared four Ukrainian regions as part of Russia, but while Russian forces in eastern Ukraine occupy most of Luhansk, their invasion of Donetsk has stalled and they are on the back foot in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south.\n\nAhead of Friday's Scholz-Putin call, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov complained that European countries had offered nothing concrete so far in terms of mediation.\n\n\"Macron, by the way, has been regularly stating over the last two weeks that he was planning a conversation with the Russian president,\" he was quoted as saying, while adding that Russia had not had any signals via diplomatic channels.\n\nMr Lavrov named former US Secretary of State John Kerry as the kind of figure who had in the past been able to solve problems and engage in true dialogue.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Friday that the time had come to work for a just peace for Ukraine, but it had to come through independence for Kyiv and not its surrender. \"The Kremlin must now give concrete signals instead of bombing the population,\" he told La Repubblica newspaper.\n\nTurkey's Foreign Minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said \"before next spring\" a clearer picture would emerge of how a truce or ceasefire might be established. But he said the situation on the ground had made the task more complicated.\n\nSarah Rainsford/BBC\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury visited a bombed bridge in Irpin as well as the site of a mass grave of civilians\n\nMeanwhile, on a visit to Ukraine, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said there could be no peace until Russia stopped lying about what it was doing in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking in Bucha, where Russian troops are accused of committing war crimes in the massacre of hundreds of civilians, he said: \"There can be no way forward based on lies. There were atrocities committed here.\"\n\nA senior Ukrainian official said earlier that between 10,000 and 13,000 of its soldiers had been killed since the start of Russia's invasion on 24 February.\n\nNeither Ukraine nor Russia tend to release figures for casualties, and the remarks by presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak have not been confirmed by the Ukrainian military.\n\nLast month, the most senior US general, Mark Milley, said around 100,000 Russian and 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed or wounded since the start of the war.\n\nSpeaking to Ukrainian TV outlet Channel 24, Mr Podolyak said Kyiv was \"openly talking about the number of the killed\". He added that the number of civilians killed could be \"significant\". He also suggested that up to 100,000 Russian soldiers had been killed since the invasion.\n\nIn a video address on Wednesday, EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said that 100,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed. However a spokesperson for the EU Commission later clarified that this was a mistake, and the figure referred to those both killed and wounded. Ms von der Leyen had also spoken of 20,000 Ukrainian civilian deaths.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nDuring a visit to Australia, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Europe had to build its defence capabilities: \"Europe isn't strong enough right now. We would be in trouble without the United States\"\n\nThe European Union was set to back a cap of $60 on the price of Russian oil, with the aim of preventing Russia profiting from oil exports while avoiding a price spike\n\nSix Ukrainian embassies and consuls have received packages containing eyeballs\n\nThe head of the UN's atomic energy agency, Rafael Grossi, says he is close to securing a deal to safeguard Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.\n\nWatch: Ukrainians grieve their fallen soldiers",

Despite an imperfect system of collective security, United Nations peacemaking and peacekeeping has helped to end conflicts, saving millions of lives, he added.\n\n\"Notwithstanding this important progress, we are still grappling with many of the same challenges we have faced for 76 years: inter-State wars, limits to our peacekeeping ability, terrorism, and a divided collective security system,\" he said. His proposed New Agenda for Peace will speak to all Member States and call for new norms, regulations and accountability mechanisms to strengthen the multilateral system in areas where gaps have emerged, he explained.\n\n\"We have the opportunity and the obligation to remember the promise of the United Nations Charter: To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. We must keep this promise with the help of a revitalized, effective, representative and inclusive multilateralism,\" he said. Most Member States now recognize that the Council should be reformed to reflect contemporary geopolitical realities, he pointed out, voicing hope that regional groups and Member States can achieve greater consensus on the way forward.\n\nCsaba Krsi (Hungary), President of the General Assembly, noting that 193 Member States have placed their trust in the 15-member Council, pointed out that 10 months into the war in Ukraine, not a single Council resolution has been adopted to mitigate the exact type of crisis the Organization was created to prevent. The veto initiative has opened an important door for a new form of collaboration and accountability, he said, as the Assembly now is obliged to step up when Council decisions are blocked by permanent member wielding their veto.\n\nFor the United Nations to prove its relevance, and for it to survive, it must deliver solutions for its 8 billion end-users, he continued, adding that collaboration across bodies, organs and processes is needed to respond to that complexity. Spotlighting the intergovernmental negotiations on a Council reform framework, he emphasized that deadlock among Member States means a dead end for the millions of people who suffer the consequences.\n\nIn the ensuing debate, over 60 ministers, senior officials and representatives voiced broad support for Council reform. Many speakers called for limited use of the veto power, as well as greater representation for underrepresented regions, with the representatives of France and the United Kingdom voicing support for permanent seats for Brazil, Germany, India and Japan. Delegates differed, however, on the way forward for membership expansion and intergovernmental negotiations on Council reform.\n\nSubrahmanyam Jaishankar, Minister for External Affairs of India, Council President for December, speaking in his national capacity, said that those negotiations are being conducted with no time frame, text or record-keeping. This moment of crisis must \"capture the sense of change and not remain the prisoner of past,\" he said, noting that Member States from Latin America and Asia, as well as small island developing States, should have ongoing representation in the Council.\n\nBrazils representative, in a similar vein, said the Council cannot be effective if Latin America and Africa are not represented as permanent members. Noting that intergovernmental negotiations have run their course, he said that Member States must negotiate reform in good faith and with a sense of urgency. Underscoring the deadlock in the Council resulting from the conflict in Ukraine and its destabilizing effects on the world, he voiced support for initiatives to regulate the use of the veto, which should only be used once diplomacy has failed.\n\nChinas representative also touched on the Councils working methods and suggested the creation of co-penholder systems with a regular rotation among permanent and non-permanent members, thus enhancing the voice of small and medium-sized countries. Underscoring the need to correct the imbalance of the Councils composition, he said that increasing the number of members from developing and independent countries must be a priority.\n\nThe Russian Federations representative, pointing to exclusively Western-controlled partnerships in the United Nations, said the Council can be democratized exclusively through expanded representation for African, Asian and Latin American countries. Western States desire to preserve their monopolistic, privileged position in the world is undermining confidence in international institutions and international law, he said.\n\nYamada Kenji, State Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, countering that claim, said the credibility of the United Nations is in jeopardy due to the Russian Federations aggression, which the 15-member organ has not been able yet to stop. Reform is achievable, and the time is ripe, he emphasized, adding that negotiations can be immediately launched, with a text on the table, in the intergovernmental negotiations for Member States to narrow the differences in their positions.\n\nBilawal Bhutto Zardari, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, said States must turn their attention away from pursuing national ambitions and the Council must seek to resolve conflicts and disputes, and not merely manage them. On Council expansion, he warned that adding new permanent members would numerically reduce the opportunities for States to be represented and contribute to the paralysis of the Council.\n\nAlso speaking today were ministers, senior officials and representatives of the United Arab Emirates, United States, Ghana, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Albania, Norway, Gabon, Armenia, Poland, Kuwait, Azerbaijan, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Philippines, Slovenia, Singapore, Egypt, Guatemala, Estonia, Republic of Korea, Ethiopia, Ecuador, Bulgaria, Argentina, South Africa, Malta, Saint Lucia, Qatar, Liechtenstein, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Trkiye, Spain, Germany, Thailand, Venezuela, Chile, Iran, Nepal, Latvia, Viet Nam (on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations), Morocco, Kazakhstan, Portugal, Lebanon, Australia, Cuba, Romania, Lithuania, Georgia, Nigeria and Ukraine, as well as the European Union.\n\nThe representative of India took the floor a second time.\n\nThe meeting began at 10:04 a.m., suspended at 1:14 p.m., resumed at 3:10 p.m. and ended at 6:56 p.m.\n\nBriefings\n\nANTNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said that strengthening multilateralism has been his highest priority since assuming office as Secretary-General. His report Our Common Agenda and the process it initiated are aimed at reinvigorating multilateralism to deal with todays interconnected threats. Even during the darkest periods of the cold war, collective decision-making and continuous dialogue in the Security Council maintained a functioning albeit imperfect system of collective security. States armed with nuclear weapons cooperated to cut their numbers, prevent proliferation and avert a nuclear catastrophe. Peacemaking and peacekeeping by the United Nations helped to end conflicts, saving millions of lives.\n\n\"Notwithstanding this important progress, we are still grappling with many of the same challenges we have faced for 76 years: inter-State wars, limits to our peacekeeping ability, terrorism, and a divided collective security system,\" he said. Conflict has dramatically evolved in how it is fought, by whom, and where, while the climate crisis is contributing to conflict in a host of ways. Misinformation and hate speech online are poisoning democratic debate and fuelling social instability, and many elements of modern life including cyberspace and migration are weaponized. However, frameworks for global cooperation have failed to keep pace, he said, emphasizing that the international communitys toolbox, norms, and approaches need upgrading.\n\nAs part of his report Our Common Agenda, he proposed a New Agenda for Peace, which he hopes to submit to Member States in 2023, he said. It will speak to all Member States and address the full range of new and old security challenges. It will examine ways to update existing tools for mediation, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, and counterterrorism, and consider how the United Nations can adapt its efforts vis--vis cyberthreats, information warfare and other forms of conflict. It will look to Member States for new frameworks to reinforce multilateral solutions and to manage intense geopolitical competition. The New Agenda for Peace will, among other things, call for new norms, regulations and accountability mechanisms to strengthen the multilateral system in areas where gaps have emerged, he explained.\n\nThe Black Sea Grain Initiative shows that the United Nations still has a unique and important role in brokering solutions to global challenges, he said, urging Member States to build on such innovative approaches. \"Our existing tools and operations also have enormous value and have contributed to saving many lives. We must do everything we can to invest in them and adapt them to new realities.\" Where they fail, it is often because they are asked to do the impossible, he pointed out, adding that he looks forward to further discussions with Member States on this process.\n\nMember States are working hard to ensure that intergovernmental bodies evolve to meet today's needs and realities, he continued, welcoming relevant negotiations in the General Assembly since 2008. A majority of Member States now recognize that the Council should be reformed to reflect contemporary geopolitical realities. Hopefully, regional groups and Member States can achieve greater consensus on the way forward. The Council is already benefiting from new working methods, including open debates and informal mechanisms to strengthen collaboration with all Member States. The contribution of women's rights organizations to the Council has helped advance prevention work and strengthen the response to current conflicts. Consultations open to a broader range of stakeholders including those affected by conflict, displacement and human rights abuses can only benefit the Councils work, influence and credibility.\n\nTurning to calls to revitalize the Organizations other organs, he said that the General Assembly has shown that it plays a valuable role in engaging Member States. This year alone, it adopted many important resolutions, including on the war in Ukraine, the right to a healthy environment and the use of the veto by permanent Council members. The Secretariat stands ready to assist regarding any decisions by Member States to streamline Assembly practices. As regards the Economic and Social Council, he said the proposed biennial summit between that Council, heads of State and Government of the Group of 20 (G20) and the international financial institutions would be an important step towards better coordination of global governance and the creation of a global financial system that is adapted to today's world.\n\nHe concluded by saying that the challenge to be overcome is clear: \"We have the opportunity and the obligation to remember the promise of the United Nations Charter: to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. We must keep this promise with the help of a revitalized, effective, representative and inclusive multilateralism.\"\n\nCSABA KRSI (Hungary), President of the General Assembly, said that as the world emerges from the COVID19 pandemic and grapples simultaneously with the climate crisis and protracted debt, food and energy emergencies, it is clear that such global challenges are far too great for any one nation to handle alone. The only hope is to find a multilateral solution, designed in line with the Charter of the United Nations and international law. The Councils actions and its inaction can have profound effects worldwide, but too often, sharp geopolitical divides have prevented its ability to respond. Against that backdrop, he asked whether such rifts will continue to upstage the collective ability to maintain international peace and security. Further, he urged members to consider whether they will choose the phoenix rising from the ashes of war, as depicted in Per Krohgs Untitled (Mural for Peace) in the Council chamber, or the pain and destruction shown in Pablo Picassos Guernica hanging just beyond its doors.\n\n\"Multilateralism can work, but it must work better,\" he said. Noting that 193 Member States have placed their trust in the 15-member Council, he recalled that the Council recently established a humanitarian exemption across United Nations sanctions regimes. This will have a direct impact on many people living under dire conditions, but there are also examples of failed collective action. On that point, he said that 10 months into the war in Ukraine, not a single Council resolution has been adopted to mitigate the exact type of crisis the Organization was created to prevent. For the United Nations to prove its relevance, and for it to survive, it must deliver solutions for its 8 billion end-users. Those individuals do not neatly organize their lives into boxes labelled \"human rights\", \"development\" and \"peace\", he emphasized, stating that collaboration across bodies, organs and processes is needed to respond to that complexity.\n\nIn this vein, he said that the veto initiative has opened an important door for a new form of collaboration and accountability, as the General Assembly has been obliged to step up when decisions by the Council are blocked. Further, he spotlighted the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform framework, in which all Member States participate. Supporting todays focus on tangible steps, he urged participants in the meeting to move from a position of \"no\" or \"later\" to one of \"yes\" and \"now\", and to remember that deadlock means a dead end for the millions of people who suffer the consequences. Council members can respond by prioritizing dialogue and diplomacy and by trading political differences for a genuine political will to find solutions, he added.\n\nStatements\n\nSUBRAHMANYAM JAISHANKAR, Minister for External Affairs of India , said that the call for change has been accelerated by growing stresses on the international system which have brought out inequities and inadequacies in how the world functions. During the COVID19 pandemic, many vulnerable nations of the global South received their first vaccines from beyond traditional sources, he said, adding that the diversification of global production reflects how much the world order had changed. The knock-on effects of conflict situations have meanwhile underscored the necessity for a more broad-based global governance, as concerns over food, fertilizer and fuel security were not adequately articulated. With regard to climate action, instead of addressing relevant issues in the appropriate forum, there have been attempts at distraction and diversion. On terrorism, he said that multilateral platforms are being misused to justify and protect perpetrators. Calling for a more effective and credible multilateralism, he said that Member States from Latin America and Asia, as well as small island developing States, should have ongoing representation in the Council. Working methods of global institutions must be made more accountable and transparent, he added. He went on to say that intergovernmental negotiations on Council reform are being conducting with no time frame, text or record-keeping, and that after three decades, the Open-ended Working Group has nothing to show for its efforts, creating intense frustration among Member States. This moment of crisis must \"capture the sense of change and not remain the prisoner of past,\" he said, adding that reform is the need of the day.\n\nNOURA BINT MOHAMMED AL KAABI, Minister for Culture and Youth of the United Arab Emirates , said that the Security Councils structure is not reflective of geopolitical reality, with the Arab world and Africa still disenfranchised in both categories of membership. Further, rising geopolitical tensions are threatening cooperation on pressing global challenges and polarization is increasingly disrupting critical multilateral processes. In the Council, consensus is becoming more difficult around issues that usually produce unanimity, such as vital mandate renewals for peace operations. Increasingly, middle Powers, developing countries and smaller States are stepping up to ensure continued multilateral dialogue and progress. Reforming multilateralism will not be easy, she said, adding that concrete outcomes will require concessions and compromises, whether in intergovernmental negotiations or during a general review of quotas. \"We have heard the growing calls for reform and we recognize that resisting them means running on borrowed time,\" she said.\n\nLINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD ( United States ) recalled that when it was established 77 years ago, the original purpose of the United Nations was to keep the peace. There have been failures, including a war started by a permanent member of the Council, but also successes, including curtailing nuclear proliferation and lifting 1 billion people out of poverty. The international community must do better and act to fight climate change, prevent future pandemics and, most importantly, defend the United Nations Charter and hold those who undermine it accountable. By upholding the Charter and taking collective action, the international community can solve food security, extreme poverty and share resources. To that end, the United States will pursue modernization at the United Nations, she said, highlighting its co-sponsorship of an initiative requiring the Assembly to convene a meeting after a veto is cast as well as its support in expanding Council membership, including permanent seats for Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. The Council must reflect todays realities, not those of 77 years ago. Compromise will be necessary, but the United States is open to any sensible and politically viable paths forward which Member States might suggest. Encouraging broader reforms for the Organization, she called for updated health structures, a more accountable development system and a commitment to the hard work of consensus-building.\n\nRAMSES CLELAND ( Ghana ) said that todays challenges underpin the need for comprehensive and integrated reform of all the pillars of the multilateral system, especially the peace and security architecture, as well as development and financial systems. The reform process must yield real changes to the Councils structure and practices across the five clusters under discussion in the intergovernmental negotiations. Emerging threats and a clarified understanding of the impact of other crises on peace and security imply that a reformed multilateralism needs to embrace an integrated approach to peace and security. It should also take into consideration international developmental institutions and processes outside the United Nations that are failing to adequately respond to pressing global needs, especially those of the developing world, he said.\n\nRONALDO COSTA FILHO ( Brazil ) said that the development gap between nations must be at the heart of international governance, with Council discussions highlighting the clear link between inequality and conflicts. Underscoring the deadlock in the Council resulting from the conflict in Ukraine and its destabilizing effects on the world, he supported initiatives to regulate the use of the veto, which should only be used once diplomacy has failed. He added that the Council cannot be effective if Latin America and Africa remain unrepresented as permanent members. Brazil is disappointed that Council reform went unmentioned in \"A New Agenda for Peace\" proposed by the Secretary-General in Our Common Agenda. Formulating such an agenda requires profound discussion of relaunching talks beyond the intergovernmental negotiations process, which has run its course. \"Lets finally go for the low-hanging fruit,\" he said. After nearly a decade during which some delegations effectively took the reform process hostage, Member States must untangle themselves and negotiate reform in good faith and with a sense of urgency, he added.\n\nFERGAL MYTHEN ( Ireland ) said multilateral institutions and the rules and norms that underpin them must evolve to face the realities of today. Highlighting, among other efforts, the Councils adoption of resolution 2664 (2022) to help ensure that humanitarians can continue their vital work without fear of inadvertently falling foul of United Nations sanctions regimes, he said: \"The lesson for this Council is clear when we cooperate, and act in good faith, reform is possible, and new norms can be established.\" Noting that the Council itself is long overdue for reform, he said the historic and unjust underrepresentation of Africa on the 15-member organ must be addressed. \"Those that are most often the subject of Security Council discussions must have more of a say at this table,\" he added. Moreover, how the Council takes decisions must also change, he emphasized, pointing to its inability to respond to the Russian Federations illegal invasion of Ukraine. The veto is an anachronism and allows aggressors to evade accountability. At a very minimum, all Council members should agree to refrain from blocking resolutions intended to prevent or stop mass atrocities, he underscored. The Secretary-Generals Our Common Agenda offers a path forward, he said, adding that Ireland will play an active role in its implementation and looks forward to working with partners on the New Agenda for Peace.\n\nBARBARA WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ) underlined the importance of strengthening the multilateral system and supporting the rules-based international order in light of extraordinary, complex and interconnected challenges, including the global threats posed by climate change and human rights violations that disproportionately affect women and girls. Further, with the Russian Federations illegal invasion of Ukraine, the world is witnessing a permanent member of the Council violating the Charter of the United Nations and flouting the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United Nations must continue to take decisive action, but the world today is very different from the one that gave birth to the Organization in 1945. Stressing that the Council must become more representative of todays world, she supported permanent seats for Brazil, Germany, India and Japan, along with permanent African representation. Beyond the Council, she welcomed the Secretary-Generals efforts to advance wider reform, emphasizing that better data use, analysis, innovation and strategic foresight can unlock the Organizations full potential.\n\nNICOLAS DE RIVIRE ( France ) said that the multilateral international order is being undermined by proponents of the law of the strongest. Most of the challenges faced by the international community require a collective response. France favours Council reform and supports the candidacy of Germany, Brazil, India and Japan to become permanent members, together with a stronger presence of African countries in both the permanent and non-permanent categories. An enlarged Council could have up to 25 members, he said, adding that France has proposed that the five permanent members voluntarily and collectively suspend the use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities. This voluntary approach does not require a revision of the United Nations Charter, but only a political commitment by the permanent members. He called on all Member States to support this initiative, which has already received the support of 106 countries.\n\nZHANG JUN ( China ) said that to improve unity and cooperation, Council members should respect each other and avoid divisions and confrontations. Urging the Council to adhere to the political settlement of disputes, he pointed out the limited effectiveness of sanctions and other coercive measures. He called for existing sanctions to be reviewed, updated or lifted in light of developments on the ground and urged the Council to take measures based on hotspot issues, while eliminating the breeding ground for conflicts. Turning to working methods, he suggested the creation of co-penholder systems with a regular rotation among permanent and non-permanent members to enhance the voice of small and medium-sized countries. Spotlighting the systematic flows of global governance, he called for enhancing representation of developing countries in global affairs. Reiterating Chinas support for reforms with priority given to increasing the number of members from developing and independent countries, he underscored the need to correct the imbalance of the Councils composition. He urged for special arrangements to be made to accommodate Africas concerns and enhance its representation.\n\nMARTIN KIMANI ( Kenya ) said the need for reforming the United Nations, including the Security Council, has been repeatedly embraced, recognizing the need for multilateralism to be fit to meet the most urgent challenges. From climate change to the inequities and inequalities of the global financial and trading system, and to the abuse of military might contrary to international law, there is impunity for those with more power over those with a deficit of it. There are serious deficits in the balance of responsibilities and in the balance of consequences. As a results of these imbalances, the worlds confidence in the multilateral institutions is low and falling rapidly. The Secretary-General must be fully partial to the Charter of the United Nations, and he should fully exercise Article 99 without regard for the approval or disapproval of any State or party. There is also a need for substantive and procedural reforms of the Security Council. Africa will no longer accept a junior position in global affairs and will not accept skewed numbers or imbalances when its security is at stake. The new Agenda for Peace must include Security Council reform, including the existing practice of penholding. All new files from Africa must have a member of the Security Councils African 3 (Gabon, Ghana and Kenya), or the collective, as pens during their terms, which will better enable these members to draft mandates and statements more in keeping with the required solutions, and to enjoy greater confidence by members and citizens.\n\nJUAN RAMN DE LA FUENTE RAMREZ ( Mexico ) said that Council reform is a superficial response to a more dire problem: a total loss of global trust. It is impossible to talk about reforms to multilateral governance without highlighting the urgent need to address socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic, he added, stressing that the global debt crisis and scarcity of resources for social development have reversed progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. However, he recognized the role multilateralism played in solutions to long-standing conflicts or those inherited from colonialism. Rather than reform calling for increasing the number of permanent members of the Security Council, Mexico supports increasing in the number of seats for elected members through periodic elections not for perpetuity. Periodic, democratic elections are the true test of accountability, he said.\n\nFERIT HOXHA ( Albania ) said at a time when key principles of the rules-based international order and essential instruments of international cooperation are challenged, strong and effective multilateralism, based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and justice, is indispensable to secure peace, stability and prosperity. Genuine commitments to multilateralism and joint efforts have contributed to hold this remarkable system together. Today, the biggest challenge is the ability to maintain the system, reform and adapt it to the changing times, and keep it effective, he added. Unfortunately, multilateralism is not always a synonym for success, such as when the rise of nationalism and authoritarianism undermine effective decision-making, when narrow self-interests prevent the Council to act and discharge its responsibilities. Together with the veto initiative, this has confirmed the necessity of a strengthened cooperation among the main organs of the Organization and has contributed to revitalize and empower the General Assembly. It is imperative to improve the functioning of the Council and its ability to take action, remain credible and act on behalf of the entire United Nations membership, and rethink the future of United Nations operations so that they are fit for addressing challenges, old and new.\n\nMONA JUUL ( Norway ) said that there are ways to make the Council more effective, transparent and accountable that do not require amendments to the United Nations Charter. These steps can and must be taken now. The Council also must hear from more diverse voices, she said, adding that Norway supports more permanent and non-permanent seats for Africa, as well as their request to sponsor African dossiers. As well, the Council should engage more civil society briefers, including women human rights defenders, and draw more regularly on the expertise of human rights institutions and capacities within the United Nations system. It would also benefit from additional informal situational awareness briefings from the Secretariat. In addition, the Council must be more connected with the rest of the multilateral system, she said, welcoming the Assemblys vital role in adopting the veto initiative. The Council should also better align its work to other parts of the United Nations, such as the Peacebuilding Commission, and with regional bodies such as the African Union.\n\nMICHEL XAVIER BIANG ( Gabon ) said that 75 years after the United Nations was created, the world and its geopolitical landscape have completely changed, and that democratic values at the national level are slow to be translated at the global level. \"We cannot meet these challenges of this century with the tools of another era,\" he said, emphasizing that the Council must be representative of current and future challenges. Reform should give priority to the African common position and its legitimate claims, he said, adding that Africa will not wait indefinitely and that multilateralism must prevail over unilateralist positions. \"It is illusory to think that humankind will survive with bubbles of security and prosperity surrounded by an ocean of insecurity and misery. The inevitable alternative to peace and prosperity for all will unavoidably be the endangering of all,\" he said.\n\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) said that Western States desire to preserve their monopolistic, privileged position in the world is undermining confidence in international institutions and international law. The future world order is being decided and States must choose between an order with a single hegemon that establishes rules only beneficial to it, or a democratic, multipolar, just and United Nations-centric world without blackmail, domination, intimidation or neo-colonialism. Having pursued the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to the detriment of the principle of indivisible security, the West has brought Europe to the brink of confrontation \"that could scorch the entire world\". The West has placed a wager on the exhaustion and strategic defeat of the Russian Federation, but if anyone believes that this began in February 2022, then they are mistaken. The United States and its satellites are betting on a broad coalition targeting main and new centres of power, he said, adding that the Wests rules-based order seeks to involve as many States as possible in its crusade against autocracy. This negative trend creates exclusively Western-controlled partnerships and it is found in a concentrated form in the United Nations. The United Nations must be adapted to modern realities, he added, underscoring that the Council can be democratized exclusively through expanded representation for African, Asian and Latin American countries.\n\nBILAWAL BHUTTO ZARDARI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan , underscored the importance of empowering and efficiently utilizing all of the Organizations main organs. States must turn their attention away from pursuing national ambitions and instead confront ideologies of hate, which impose discrimination and violence including threats of genocide. The Council must seek to resolve conflicts and disputes, and not merely manage them. It must act pre-emptively, with the ability to convene automatically on any item on its agenda, if requested by a Council member or a concerned State. No party to a conflict should be able to refuse the Secretary-Generals good offices or reject modalities for the specific dispute settlement. On Council expansion, he said that adding new permanent members would numerically reduce the opportunities for States to be represented. It would also contribute to the paralysis of the Council. He went on to say that Pakistan will convene a ministerial conference of the \"Group of 77\" developing countries and China on 15 and 16 December to adopt a plan for systematic reform of the international financial, trade and technology architectures. Speaking on an \"unaddressed\" agenda item, he said that implementation of Council resolutions on Kashmir would prove that multilateralism can succeed.\n\nARARAT MIRZOYAN, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Armenia , said that he supports making the Council more inclusive and effective, and reiterated Armenias support for India to become a permanent member. Noting a decline of multilateralism, he recalled that the international community was unable to prevent Azerbaijans use of force in Nagorno-Karabakh, resulting in a new wave of displacement. He also pointed to the inability of the Council-mandated Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to fulfil its duties, as one party has unilaterally declared the conflict as resolved. Worse, he added, Azerbaijan has blocked access the Lachin Corridor, depriving the people of Nagorno-Karabakh humanitarian aid and freedom of movement. He reiterated the importance of fulfilling commitments, namely in the Armenia-Azerbaijan normalization process. \"Based on our own experience, we can argue that without effective multilateralism, the world will be devoid of peace and security,\" he said.\n\nYAMADA KENJI, State Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan , said the credibility of the United Nations is in jeopardy due to the aggression by the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the Security Council, against one of its neighbours, and the 15-member organ has not been able yet to stop it. Confidence in the United Nations must be restored. That means strengthening the entire United Nations, including, but not limited to, the General Assembly, the role of the Secretary-General, the Peacebuilding Commission and the International Court of Justice. Council reform is an integral part of the whole picture. Reform is possible and achievable, and the time is ripe: what is truly needed is not a discussion for the sake of discussion, but action towards reform. Negotiations can be immediately launched, with a text on the table, in the intergovernmental negotiations in order for Member States to narrow the differences in their positions. Member States have already reformed the Security Council once, and can do it again. The historical injustice that there are no permanent seats for Africa, even as that continent accounts for about half of the regional agenda of the Council, needs to be corrected. The Charter should reflect the reality of today, not that of 77 years ago. While the Assembly makes its effort to reform the Council, the 15-member organ can do more than just wait. Council members can and should improve the transparency and efficiency of the organ by improving its working methods, including limiting the use of the veto.\n\nWOJCIECH GERWEL, Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland , said cooperation must be based on the values of freedom, democracy and justice, in line with the Charter and driven by partnership and solidarity among nations. This is the only way to address global fragilities, foster dialogue, manage security threats and achieve stability and prosperity for all with an efficient United Nations system. Poland fully supports efforts to reform the United Nations with a more representative, efficient and inclusive Security Council. However, Council members and the whole international community need to fully accept that the organ has currently been paralysed in one of its core obligations to secure global peace due to the abuse of the veto right of one of its permanent members regarding its own actions. The Russian Federations war against Ukraine constitutes the most serious challenge to international security since the end of the Second World War due to its global consequences and the challenges to multilateralism. As the Kremlin is continuously assaulting the Charter and abusing its veto power in the Council, transparency and accountability are needed whenever such a veto is used. As the world is facing the deepening twin crises of security and environment, the need for collective solutions is particularly urgent. The obligation is to make the United Nations better prepared to meet the expectations of this and future generations.\n\nABDULAZIZ ALJARALLAH, Assistant Foreign Minister for International Organizations of Kuwait , said reforming the United Nations must be a top priority for the international community, which must put forward innovative ideas to generate the necessary momentum for reform. \"Reforming multilateralism is an urgent need and a historical responsibility towards our people,\" he emphasized, underscoring the need for an effective global system based on cooperation, rule of law and aimed at achieving justice. He affirmed Kuwaits willingness to support genuine and comprehensive reform of the Council, which must become more effective to confront challenges, and more representative, transparent, impartial and credible. The Council, with its current composition, cannot address todays interrelated and emerging challenges. All States must engage effectively with intergovernmental negotiations, and they must be open to consult with all negotiation groups transparently and constructively, he said, stressing that the concerns of all regional groups must be considered.\n\nSUBRAHMANYAM JAISHANKAR, Minister for External Affairs of India and Council President for December, took the floor a second time in his national capacity to say that the credibility of the United Nations depends on its effective response to key challenges of the times, such as the pandemic, climate change, conflict and terrorism. While the international community searches for the best solutions, its discourse must never accept the normalization of such threats. Stressing that this applies to State sponsorship of cross-border terrorism, he underscored that hosting Osama bin Laden and attacking a neighbouring Parliament cannot serve as credentials for sermonizing before the Council.\n\nFARIZ RZAYEV, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan , said that Article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations is clear regarding States obligation to accept and carry out the Councils decisions. Therefore, the Councils lack of attention to the disregard and misinterpretation of its resolutions is not a positive practice. On that point, he recalled that the organs resolutions concerning Azerbaijan went unimplemented for 27 years. Those resolutions demanded the immediate, complete and unconditional end of the occupation of Azerbaijans sovereign territory, but they were simply ignored with complete impunity while hundreds of thousands of people were uprooted for almost thirty years. He went on to recall that Azerbaijan was obliged to launch a counter-offensive operation because of a large-scale armed provocation by Armenia in September 2020. This was in line with Article 51 of the Charter and relevant Council resolutions and, as a result of the operation, Azerbaijans territory was liberated from long-term, unlawful foreign military occupation. He added that his country extends a hand of post-conflict normalization to Armenia, calling on that country to, inter alia, end its illegal activities, cease its territorial claims and concentrate on direct negotiations towards a diplomatic solution.\n\nMAURIZIO MASSARI ( Italy ) said the intergovernmental negotiations process is the only credible platform for Council reform and only natural forum for discussing it. Underscoring that decisions should be taken not by the exclusive few, but by all Council members in an inclusive way, he called for going beyond the simple increase of members to enhancing the role and voice of underrepresented countries, in particular Africa and small island developing States. Reiterating support for restricting the veto, he said that every new member of a reformed Council must be elected. The reformed Council is well within our reach, he stressed, noting that it is not the absence of a text that is hampering the progress, but debate focused on process and procedural matters.\n\nADRIAN DOMINIK HAURI ( Switzerland ) said that effective multilateralism must translate into tangible results, with the protection of civilians one of its highest priorities. The veto must not prevent the Council from fulfilling its mandate to protect civilians, prevent conflict and ensure accountability for atrocities committed, he said. Effective multilateralism must take into account diversity of actors and promote inclusive approaches, while avoiding duplication. The density and diversity of organizations makes Geneva the second headquarters and operational engine of the United Nations a place for innovation and anticipation that is open and responsive to Member States, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, data science and science diplomacy. To respond to global challenges, the world should further leverage this center of global governance and \"Geneva-style multilateralism\", he added.\n\nALEXANDER MARSCHIK ( Austria ) called for a more transparent, accountable and inclusive Council with a more representative membership reflective of todays world and its diversity. He emphasized that there is no lack of international norms, but a disregard for the rules as well as lack of compliance and implementation. He suggested creating a mechanism by which illegal acts or acts entailing grave risks for humankind automatically or almost automatically trigger a clearly defined set of serious consequences. Reiterating support for wider membership, he recalled that Council members serve \"for all of us, not for national interests\". States deserve to be on the Council not because of their size or power, but due to their contributions to the maintenance of international peace and security. He stressed that effective multilateralism requires not only speaking, but listening; not only demanding, but also offering.\n\nANTONIO M. LAGDAMEO ( Philippines ), aligning with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), voiced concern over setbacks in the Security Council reform and urged member States to surpass lengthy negotiations. For lack of consensus on how to move forward, he suggested examining key elements which would make the Council more reflective of todays world, namely, improving its working methods, which should encourage greater participation of non-members in its decision-making process, as well as renewed respect for the rule of law, he said. He underscored the importance of the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes in this regard. The Declaration reaffirms the role of the Council in settling disputes and also highlights the role of the International Court of Justice as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, he said. Voicing support for the Secretary-Generals call to strengthen the Councils role in conflict prevention, he said it must not be outpaced by a rapidly changing global security landscape.\n\nBOTJAN MALOVRH ( Slovenia ) said adept global governance must mirror the interconnectedness of the world today. The most recent crises, such as the COVID19 pandemic, global food crisis, and climate change are stark reminders that today's complex challenges are not those of one State or region but of the entire world. Only through working in synergy will the international community find comprehensive and sustainable collective solutions to ongoing and future challenges. There is a growing understanding among member States that the multilateral architecture must remain a living mechanism able to adapt to the new realities of the world, he said, stressing the urgency to reform the body holding primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Only a more representative Council, which reflects the realities and diversity of the contemporary international community, can effectively deliver on its mandate. It needs stronger and more permanent voices from regions that have been overlooked and underrepresented.\n\nBURHAN GAFOOR ( Singapore ) said any Council reform exercise must strengthen respect for the United Nations Charter and international law. Whenever international law and the principles of the Charter are violated, the international community must send an unambiguous signal that such behaviour is unacceptable. The Council is charged with the primary responsibility to maintain international peace and security and must live up to its responsibilities. The permanent members must show leadership and be net contributors to peace and security, without becoming sources of tension and instability. The Council should also address security challenges arising from non-traditional issues, such as climate change. A robust multilateral system requires a strengthened role for the General Assembly, he added, emphasizing that reform must extend beyond the United Nations system by addressing the overall architecture of the multilateral system, reforming international financial institutions and ensuring they work more closely with the United Nations.\n\nOSAMA MAHMOUD ABDELKHALEK MAHMOUD ( Egypt ) said that debate on United Nations reform surfaces each time international crises worsen, demonstrating the fact that global international governance fails to reflect the aspirations of peoples and States, particularly developing States. Such States call for climate and financial justice, along with meaningful participation in international decision-making, and this can only be achieved through reform of the United Nations and international financial institutions. Further, the United Nations addresses issues relating to peace and security with robust tools, mandates and budgets, he said, but when the Organization considers sustainable development, on which most Member States depend, there is no specific financing nor clear tools for implementation. This imbalance must be addressed, he said. Council reform cannot be achieved through one-off solutions, he added, emphasizing the need to uphold the Ezulwini Consensus as Africa cannot be kept on the sidelines.\n\nCARLA MARIA RODRGUEZ MANCIA ( Guatemala ) said that the Council should adequately respond to the Russian Federations aggression against Ukraine. Emphasizing that the reform can no longer be delayed, she called for more coherence and underscored the need for stronger preventive diplomacy. The Council should prevent conflicts rather than wait to react to them when they erupt. Reiterating support for the Peacebuilding Commission, she spotlighted the need for stronger environmental action and urged that the Commissions interventions respect natural resources. She supported the Council including climate security assessments in its work, saying that should be able to identify vulnerability and assess risks through a climate perspective and early-warning systems. Climate change and security share an intrinsically symbiotic relationship, she said, adding that environmental degradation, climate change and biodiversity loss not only contribute to conflicts but can also play an important role in conflict resolution.\n\nREIN TAMMSAAR ( Estonia ) said that his country supports the Secretary-Generals initiative for reinvigorating multilateralism and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. However, a permanent member of the Council is waging a bloody colonial war against its neighbour, and the Councils inability to take substantive decisions demonstrates the urgent need for reform. At the core of any attempt to renew or strengthen multilateralism must be the Charter, in particular international peace and security, he continued, adding that any State that exercises the veto to protect its own actions seriously undermines the whole multilateral system and should be held fully accountable. The main goal of reform must be a revitalized United Nations with better accountability of the Council to the entire membership, he said. He went on to say that the Russian Federations aggression and reckless nuclear blackmail must be stopped. If not, the consequences for the world and multilateralism will be much worse, he added.\n\nJOONKOOK HWANG ( Republic of Korea ) said greater efforts must be made to revitalize the General Assembly, including by streamlining its agendas and discussions and by devising monitoring and review mechanisms for resolutions. Organizational and financial reforms should be directed at conflict prevention and peacebuilding, he said, adding that the Organization expand its role into new areas and take the lead in a data-driven world. Expanding permanent membership in the Council would significantly hinder the Organizations ability to adapt to ever-changing international realities. Moreover, it would only be possible at the expense of other countries opportunities to serve on the Council. He urged Member States to proceed with realistic perceptions and a more reasonable approach, adding that the Council should try to modernize its agenda.\n\nTAYE ATSKESELASSIE AMDE ( Ethiopia ) said that the principles of the United Nations Charter are timeless, and that no Member State nor alliance should undermine the sovereignty of States or peaceful resolution of disputes. Representation of States, and especially African States, is lacking at the United Nations, he said, calling for a change in the status quo. \"The working methods we follow buttress hegemony of the few and put the majority of States under undesirable guardianship,\" he said, adding that any reform in the Organization must rectify colonial legacies. Ethiopia, as a member of the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement, believes that States can assert their norms while maintaining a Charter-based order, with the United Nations playing a pivotal role. Expressing concern over the influence of non-State actors, such as commercial entities, in national and international security, he said that multilateral reform must address and regulate their activities to become a force for good.\n\nCRISTIAN ESPINOSA ( Ecuador ) said that delays in Council reform continue to tie the Organization to an institutional format that has been in place since 1966. Council members should encourage and promote a true modernization of its working methods in order to achieve a more inclusive, transparent and effective body. The 10 elected members play a vital role in pushing for transformation in a constructive manner, he said, adding that the Council's synergies with all organs of the United Nations system, including the General Assembly, must be strengthened. Resolution 76/262 renewed the dynamics of work in this area, allowing for discussion among Member States each time the veto is used in the Council. He went on to support the initiative by France and Mexico to restrict the use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities and called for others to support it as well.\n\nLACHEZARA STOEVA ( Bulgaria ), associating herself with the statement to be delivered by the European Union, said that the Russian Federations aggression against Ukraine is a grave, blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations. Yet, the Council is unable to perform its duties, she said, adding that all too often, the Council has failed to rise to the occasion. \"And we have collectively expressed regret, shrugged shoulders and, ultimately, have accepted it is a fact of life,\" she added. However, the Russian Federations aggression has demonstrated that Council reform cannot wait, she continued. The General Assemblys resolution on the use of the veto gives Member States the opportunity to hold the relevant Council member accountable for why it chose to prevent the organ from acting. She went on to stress that, while upholding international law, the international community must also face its weakest point namely, how to effectively address violations and lack of accountability.\n\nMARA DEL CARMEN SQUEFF ( Argentina ) said that the COVID19 pandemic demonstrated that renewed multilateralism remains an urgent moral and political imperative. Unilateral means run counter to law and any deviation from universal norms undermines the idea of multilateralism. Increasing the Councils membership is one of the most reasonable ways to make it more representative, she said, adding that only an increased number of non-permanent seats can create a new dynamic and give elected members new influence and greater participation. Council reform is part of a broader reform of multilateralism, she said, adding that \"we need cooperation and not confrontation\".\n\nMATHU JOYINI ( South Africa ) said the current system is unequal, unfair, unjust and non-representative. To achieve peace, Member States must reform the basis on which they engage, with multilateralism at its heart. Due to its limited ability to respond to security challenges, the Council suffers from a crisis of credibility and legitimacy. She called for new reorientation, momentum and political will to transform the Organization into a global, fit-for-purpose, effective, agile, action-oriented and forward-looking tool that reflects current geopolitical realities and its membership. Member States must strengthen the rules-based international system in a networked and inclusive manner, move quickly to transform other multilateral institutions and global governance structures, and give equal importance and priority to development, she said. They must also pay attention to preventive diplomacy and enhance coordination and partnerships with regional organizations such as the African Union, she added.\n\nVANESSA FRAZIER ( Malta ) said that multilateralism is not static and that new, powerful international actors must be recognized as such. Further, it is a living system that should be allowed to grow, adjust and renew itself to ensure that the principles and values of the United Nations are respected. Current circumstances and dynamics underline the need for a more inclusive organ that gives all Member States space to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. On that point, she welcomed the adoption of the Assembly resolution that provides a debate whenever a veto is cast in the Council. This new mechanism strengthens the link between the Assembly and the Council, in addition to creating more transparency and accountability. She went on to say that Malta supports the initiative by France and Mexico to restrict the use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities.\n\nMENISSA RAMBALLY ( Saint Lucia ) said that a fractured Council challenges the United Nations ability to discharge its mandates. However, the United Nations remains the best chance for peace and the worlds best multilateral success. She said that a new orientation for reformed multilateralism will require rebuilding trust among States and the peaceful settlement of disputes based on sovereignty and equality and mutual respect for differences. It also requires progress on Council reform as well as political will among States to harness multilateralism in the most harrowing of times. The need for comprehensive Council reform is recognized by all, she added.\n\nALYA AHMED SAIF AL-THANI ( Qatar ) said interconnected global challenges can only be addressed through effective multilateralism, with the United Nations front and centre. She emphasized the need for an effective and well-staffed Peacebuilding Commission that receives adequate and predictable funding. On Council reform, she said that it is more urgent as ever, given the organs position as a mainstay of the international system. No doubt that requires a new way of thinking, she said, adding the reform will fail if it focuses on only one factor while ignoring all the others. Nor will reform succeed if the principle of equality among all States is not taken into account in Council decisions. Effective multilateral efforts are the only way to achieve long-awaited success for current and future generations, she said.\n\nOLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, said the basic principles set out in the United Nations Charter lay at the core of renewed multilateralism. Defending the Charter is therefore a sine qua non, he said, adding that the Council must reflect contemporary realities and be more effective. For its permanent members, that means refraining from using the veto when there is a risk of mass atrocity crimes and not abusing the veto when they are party to a conflict. The standing mandate for a General Assembly debate whenever the veto is used ensures that the United Nations is not voiceless when the Council is deadlocked. He expressed support for French and Mexican initiative on veto restraint in cases of mass atrocities, as well as a code of conduct regarding Council action in cases involving genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nCHRISTIAN WENAWESER ( Liechtenstein ), noting that the Councils failure to respond to a brutal conflict due to a permanent members veto, said the veto initiative recalibrated the balance between the Council and the Assembly, prompting the latter to make full use of its authority. More political leadership among elected Council members can lead to more productive outcomes, he added. At the same time, equitable burden-sharing across the Council as a whole must be ensured, he said, adding that the duties of chairing subsidiary bodies should not fall disproportionately on the elected members.\n\nARRMANATHA CHRISTIAWAN NASIR ( Indonesia ) advocated for a multilateral paradigm of \"win-win\", engagement, dialogue, collaboration and solidarity, rather than \"zero-sum\", containment. Such a paradigm must consistently respect international law and the United Nations Charter. As todays world was unimaginable 77 years ago, he called for an Organization fit for its time and purpose, capable of adapting to the latest developments in technology, science and work culture. To that end, United Nations reform must be a work in progress which undertakes a holistic manner. Describing the Summit of the Future as an opportunity to make concrete progress, he said that the Council must adapt to new global realities by becoming more inclusive, transparent and democratic. There must be political will by all and clear timelines with practical targets, he said, adding that unity must be embodied within the organ itself, as membership is not a right but rather a responsibility. He went on to stress the need to promote partnerships with regional organizations, nurture synergy and ensure that multilateral and regional efforts are mutually reinforcing.\n\nMUHAMMAD ABDUL MUHITH ( Bangladesh ) said that the time is right to reform the Council, as everyone agrees that its membership and structure are not in tune with current realities. Relevant, effective, democratic, transparent and fit-for-purpose reforms must be done in a concrete manner. Both membership categories should be enlarged, he said, adding that negotiations on Council reform should be text-based. Turning to the Assembly, he said it is a symbol of multilateralism and everyone must do their part to preserve its intergovernmental, democratic and inclusive nature and to close the power gap between it and the Council as a matter of priority.\n\nANIL KAYALAR ( Trkiye ) said the rules-based international system is experiencing its gravest crisis since the Second World War, with consensus-building and compromise viewed as signs of weakness while long-standing legal norms are eroded. People are losing faith in international institutions, including the United Nations, and while the Organization might be a source of excellent ideas, it frequently lacks the means to effectively implement them, hence the need for reform. He called on the Organization and its Member States to improve and support more peace operations. Pointing to progress made in reforming the United Nations development system, he added that such efforts should continue with an emphasis on national ownership. On human rights, he underlined the need to avoid politicization and double standards, saying that the international community must ensure that its actions are in line with its words. Turning to Council reform, he said that the organ must be made more effective, democratic and transparent, and that it must serve all humanity, not just the interests of a few Member States.\n\nANA JIMENEZ DE LA HOZ ( Spain ), recognizing the trifold crisis of food security, energy and finance, reiterated the need for more effective multilateralism. Spain made several contributions to proposals of the Secretary-General, including support for the Alliance of Civilizations and digitalization initiatives, while also hosting the Information and Communications Hub in Valencia. Spotlighting its feminist foreign policy, she noted that Spain has put forward urgent initiatives, including the Food Security Summit held in September. Turning to reform, she encouraged States to look for solutions that create consensus in a realistic and feasible manner. She went on to underscore that \"elected\" is a key word in the proposal of the United by Consensus Group, since elections confer greater legitimacy upon members of the Council. Underscoring that Intergovernmental Negotiations should be a \"natural\" forum for debate, she stressed that reform must be tailored to realities, while also providing flexibility and adaptability.\n\nANTJE LEENDERTSE ( Germany ) stated that multilateralism is under pressure, emphasizing that the future Security Council should include additional permanent and non-permanent members. This is the shared Group of Four position, which also includes Brazil, India, and Japan, she said. It is also clear that Africa must be permanently represented on the Council. This year's general debate has shown that a large majority of Member States are in favor of reforming the Council. However, a formal negotiation process is still not in place, she noted, stressing the need to change this and begin negotiating a text. She urged Council members to restrict their use of the veto as much as possible.\n\nSURIYA CHINDAWONGSE ( Thailand ) said the past has shown that, at critical points of human history when humanity is confronted by existential threats and challenges, these are either addressed through conflict or through unprecedented international cooperation. The United Nations was established to ensure that humanity chose the latter and not the former. The coming together of nations in a collective effort on rules that govern peaceful inter-State relations is the hope of humanity for finding solutions to existing problems, including climate change and the food crisis. However, there is currently a crisis of confidence in the system, which is the ultimate test for multilateralism. The United Nations must focus fully on its core mission in using peaceful means to solve myriad challenges facing humanity, including conflict, whether through dialogue, negotiation, building bridges of understanding, or becoming a platform for finding sustainable solutions. A reformed United Nations and related system must protect international peace and security and prevent violations of human rights.\n\nJOAQUN ALBERTO PREZ AYESTARN ( Venezuela ) stressed that isolationism, exceptionalism and unilateralism have no place in the twenty-first century. As an intergovernmental organization, the United Nations is not simply a club of friends with ideological affinities it pursues the idea of legal equality among States. To address the Organizations crisis of confidence, leadership and values, unilateralism must be eliminated and multilateralism strengthened for it to become truly effective, representative, inclusive and participatory. Moreover, beneficial progress requires correcting imbalances in the global financial architecture and reforming the Bretton Woods institutions, he added, noting that the upcoming fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations declaration on the establishment of a \"New International Economic Order\" provides an opportunity to end prevailing asymmetries that have perpetuated underdevelopment and dependence of the Global South. He warned about incessant efforts by some States to impose \"group unilateralisms\" and a supposed \"rules-based international order\" that is not grounded in consensus or international law.\n\nPAULA NARVEZ OJEDA ( Chile ) said the Organizations failure to adequately respond to grave global threats has led to an erosion of trust in multilateralism and a dangerous scepticism regarding targets the international community has set. Respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, democracy and human rights has eroded, and Member States will to cooperate as a community in achieving development has been weakened. \"We cannot sit idly by in the face of the above,\" she stressed, urging a return to respect for the Charter and international law. This applies particularly to countries with greater power, she said, calling on such States to lead by example. She also underlined the important role played by regional mechanisms, which can serve as appropriate, effective forums for conflict prevention and peacebuilding, and provide valuable input for Council action. Further, she stressed the need to incorporate youth into the Organizations work, harnessing their expertise and vision, as they will live the future that the international community is trying so hard to improve.\n\nSATTAR AHMADI ( Iran ) said the international community is \"plagued\" by double standards, noting that the authority of the United Nations has been repeatedly abused by certain States exerting pressure on independent countries. He recalled that, at the Economic and Social Councils meeting, the United States launched a \"propaganda and misinformation campaign\" against Iran and pursued an \"illegal request\" to deprive the country of its membership privileges as the elected member of the Commission on the Status of Women. The \"politically motivated\" decision was carried out \"unlawfully\", including by placing maximum political pressure on the country, he stressed. He went on to say that deprivation of Iran from the Commission is an indication of a return to unilateralism, urging the United Nations to prevent the United States from pursuing its unilateral and egocentric agenda.\n\nINDIRA GOHIWAR ARYAL ( Nepal ) said that peace and progress achieved after the creation of the United Nations are in jeopardy due to the complex interplay of geopolitics and parochial national interests. The world is facing alarming common challenges: Poorer and conflict-affected countries have suffered the most, and impacts are vastly disproportionate. Addressing these problems requires collective action by the international community in a spirit of multilateralism. For small nations like Nepal, the United Nations is the bulwark of sovereignty and driver of peace, progress and justice. The United Nations must prepare itself to remain relevant through a process of continued reform that reflects the present-day landscapes of geopolitics and geo-economics. Reform should promote fairness, equality, inclusivity and justice for all States big or small, powerful or weak, rich or poor with strong and effective multilateralism that promotes peace and security, human rights and sustainable development alike, as they are mutually reinforcing. The world needs a broadly representative, democratic, transparent, and accountable Council to enhance the effectiveness and legitimacy of the work of the United Nations.\n\nANDREJS PILDEGOVIS ( Latvia ) said Russias military aggression against an independent, sovereign neighbouring country has shaken the very foundation on which the current international system stands. Strong global response to this flagrant breach of international norms sends a powerful message that multilateralism and the international rules-based order must prevail. Recent shocks, such as the Russian Federations aggression in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate that some aspects of multilateralism need urgent revisitation. The Russian Federations aggression proves that reform of the Security Council is not just long overdue, but needs more than ever to adequately respond to present and future challenges. That one of the permanent members, namely the Russian Federation, is committing mass atrocities in its neighbouring country and vetoes resolutions that would allow the Council to take action, is an oxymoron. To prevent impunity, the accountability gap must be closed, he said, stressing the need for an ad hoc special tribunal as the most appropriate tool to complement the International Criminal Court. The international community also needs to address key areas such as gender equality, climate change and the fight against disinformation as crucial parts of effective multilateralism, he said.\n\nDANG HOANG GIANG ( Viet Nam ), speaking for ASEAN, observed that history teaches that, whenever unilateralism was allowed to prevail over multilateralism, the world witnessed more conflict and instability. He spotlighted strong consensus among ASEAN members that multilateralism is not an option, but a necessity. The Associations members also recognize the importance of building and strengthening ASEANs partnerships with external actors such as regional and international organizations to address global concerns, pursue shared goals, narrow the development gap and promote inclusive growth. On that point, he stressed the importance of complementarity between the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nHe went on to urge a reform of multilateralism, noting that many components of the current system are not sufficiently equipped to meet complex challenges of the twenty-first century. The voices of relevant parties must be adequately reflected in a reformed system, he said, with developing countries better represented and included in global decision-making. Further, regional organizations including ASEAN can and should be inherent partners in collective efforts to address global challenges. He added that the international communitys approach to multilateral issues should be based on common principles conducive to cooperation and development, including upholding international law, promoting areas of mutual interest and avoiding actions that may aggravate tensions.\n\nOMAR KADIRI ( Morocco ) said that, in reaffirming the international communitys tireless commitment to the United Nations as the global centre of multilateralism and respecting its foundations, including sovereignty, territorial integrity of States, its reform must remain a priority. Further, Africa is the only continent with no permanent members on the Security Council, he said, calling for Council reform so that the continent can play its rightful role. Africa would prefer at least two permanent and five non-permanent seats, so that it is fairly represented, he said.\n\nANEL BAKYTBEKKYZY, ( Kazakhstan ), said that, in light of the shifting political and global security landscape, Member States must endeavour to resolve critical questions of membership categories and size, geographical representation, working methods, transparency and the Security Council-General Assembly relationship. Political will, finding common ground despite differences and achieving momentum are essential to move ahead. A new orientation of multilateralism implies holistic, multidimensional and inter-sectorial action across countries, invested by the United Nations, regional organization, and stakeholders with special expertise. Efforts should underscore the peace-security-development nexus to ensure coherence and consistency in the Organizations operations and response, reinforced by national endeavours. Kazakhstans efforts at multilateralism have been relevant and diverse on many fronts, including nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation; the Astana Process on Syria to reinforce the United Nations process in Geneva; humanitarian aid and human capacity building in Afghanistan; and support to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\nMs. BAPTISTA ( Portugal ), associating herself with the European Union, expressed support for the path towards a reformed and inclusive multilateralism presented by the Secretary-General. More voices and perspectives around the table increase the Councils capacity to anticipate and tackle global risks, she said, underscoring the importance of a global vision to security. Hopefully, a reformed multilateral system would keep human rights at its core of its work by upholding their universality. The Council can do more and better, she added. Turning to the Councils composition, she argued for the expansion of its permanent and non-permanent categories, with a better representation for Africa in both categories.\n\nYOUSSEF HITTI ( Lebanon ) said international cooperation must be more agile, effective and inclusive. Reaffirming support for the Secretary-Generals efforts and highlighting the need for governance institutions to be more representative and democratic, he said that Lebanon has joined several initiatives to strengthen transparency and accountability on the use of the veto. It also supports a more fair and just reform of the Council and continues to support the Arab Group on that issue. States, he continued, must reject selective approaches, ensure respect and harmoniously and consistently implement their international obligations. For Lebanon, a small State and a founding member of the Organization, multilateralism has been vital in past and current crises. An international order based on the rule of law is not optional but rather the essential vector for international peace, stability and security, he said, urging Member States to act with determination.\n\nMITCHELL FIFIELD ( Australia ) said the multilateral system must protect sovereign equality and the rights of small and medium-sized countries like his own. Member States must have confidence that the Council can respond effectively to threats to and breaches of international peace and security, he said, adding that the Councils inability to respond to the Russian Federations attack on Ukraine is a stark reminder of the need for Council reform. The Council must be more reflective of the world today not the world of 1945, he pointed out, urging greater representation from Asia, Africa and Latin America. The United Nations must be more accountable to members, transparent, inclusive and led by high-quality individuals, representative of all peoples and groups. Australia was an early proponent of United Nations development system reform, he said, stressing the need for a fit-for-purpose, transparent, accountable, effective and results-oriented system to deliver on Member States commitments on the 2030 Agenda. The Summit of the Future in 2024 represents an opportunity to work together towards a multilateral system that ensures that no one is left behind.\n\nYUSNIER ROMERO PUENTES ( Cuba ), underscoring that the use of unilateral coercive measures and punitive action against developing countries is contrary to multilateralism, called for the immediate cessation of these measures. Multilateralism and full respect for the rules and norms of international law provide the basis with which to advance towards a fair, equitable world, guarantee peaceful coexistence and find sustainable solutions to systemic problems. He went on to state that the General Assembly must be able to fully exercise all powers given to it by the Charter of the United Nations, free from the interference of the Security Council or other bodies. Further, full reform of the Council is needed, which ensures greater transparency and inclusivity in the organs work. The world needs solidarity, cooperation and mutual respect not blockades or sanctions to overcome current crises. He added a call for the creation of an international order that is fair, democratic, equal and responsive to the \"clamour for peace\" by the peoples of the United Nations.\n\nANDREEA MOCANU ( Romania ), associating herself with the European Union, spotlighted the years challenges to the obligations to respect international treaties and mutually agreed commitments, maintenance of peace and security, promotion of sustainable development and defence of human rights. While the majority of the Organizations membership has taken a firm stance in defending the Charter and its principles whenever there was a challenge, some States have unfortunately not seen the value of the lessons which have been learnt. Misusing the Council, Assembly or any platform of the Organization to promote a false narrative is not compatible with the principles of multilateralism nor the rules-based international order. As such, Member States cannot allow impunity for the Russian Federation and must ensure accountability with regard to its illegal brutal invasion. It is in this vein that Romania supports an effective, transparent, democratically anchored, preventative and accountable Council which corresponds to current realities and challenges, she said. Intergovernmental negotiations and \"Our Common Agenda\" provide Member States with the opportunity to act now, she underscored, emphasizing \"we cannot afford to drop any inch in our defence of the UN Charter, the democratic values and principles of multilateralism\".\n\nRYTIS PAULAUSKAS ( Lithuania ), associating himself with the European Union, said that collective decision and coordinated action are key in addressing new and emerging challenges, including climate change, health emergencies, food insecurities or hybrid threats. He expressed his countrys support for the Secretary-Generals report on Our Common Agenda and the new Agenda for Peace that aims to reinvigorate multilateralism and enhance the United Nations existent toolbox. He also welcomed the work towards more effective peacekeeping as one of the examples of a successful collective action. He reiterated Lithuanias long-standing position to work collectively on Council reform. The war against Ukraine waged by the Russian Federation exposed the structural and procedural weaknesses of the Council, he said, stressing that its composition should reflect the current geopolitical realities. The membership must include underrepresented regions, in particular Africa, but also Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe in permanent and non-permanent categories.\n\nDAVID ABESADZE ( Georgia ) said dramatic developments this year have put in question the Councils ability to effectively fulfil its primary purpose of stopping the Russian Federations aggression against Ukraine by failing in its attempts to pass resolutions due to the Russian Federations destructive action. Today, as never before, it has become obvious that there is a need for reinvigorated action to ensure the Council lives up to its raison d'tre - the maintenance of international peace and security. These blatant violations of fundamental norms and principles of international law and disregard for the territorial integrity of sovereign States have been a massive blow to the European security and the entire international order. Multilateralism works when the members of the international community abide by common rules and principles. New orientation for multilateralism means recommitting to ensuring a peaceful world based on international law, with the United Nations Charter at its core; better protection of human rights; and implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Only by upholding the principles of the Charter and through respect for international law can peace and security be maintained, and human rights and sustainable development be realized.\n\nNNAMDI NZE ( Nigeria ) reiterated Africas demand for a reform that will ensure its legitimate right to fair and equitable representation in the Council, noting that African States offered a coherent, practical, and persuasive blueprint for the Councils reform in that regard. Voicing support for other regions legitimate aspirations to be fully represented in the Council, he said Africas demand, as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration, calls for the expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent seat category of the Council, with the allocation of not less than two permanent seats with all the privileges, including the right of veto and two additional non-permanent seats. Moreover, the veto should be abolished but so long as it exists, it should be extended to all members of the expanded permanent category. He voiced hope that current realities will propel Member States to review the process in order to rectify the historical injustice done to the African continent.",

By \"encouraging\" the \"re-shoring\" of semiconductor manufacturing to the US by offering state subsidies (national security trumps free trade, but of course this is only valid for US national security), the US will eventually hollow out Taiwan's economy. This will reduce the incentive for China to take over Taiwan (China has plenty of pineapples already), while at the same time increase Taiwan's economic dependence on China (they need to sell their pineapples to somebody, now that they don't have semiconductors to sell). The Taiwanese people also can see what is going on, with the US provoking China to create a sense of crisis in order to entice Taiwanese manufacturers to move to the West. This is the reason why the DPP lost big in the recent elections. They are now being seen as complicit in helping the US destroy the Taiwanese economy. The Taiwanese perhaps don't want to reunite with the Mainland at this time, but they know that a war with China will not end well. They prefer to stay the way things are, but they can sense that the US is using Taiwan as a pressure point against China. They don't want to be the sacrificial lamb. All these visits by US politicians will only drive the Taiwanese voters away from the pro-independence DPP.",

                "cc_text": "A price cap on Russian crude oil in response to the countrys invasion and ongoing war in Ukraine will go into effect on December 5. The price cap is an effort to reduce Russias oil revenues while maintaining adequate supplies of crude on the global energy market.\n\nIn this second installment of a two-part Q&A on the price cap,[1] Edward Fishman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy, answers questions about how one can evaluate whether the policy is successful and what alternatives exist if it fails.\n\nWhat would success for the price cap look like?\n\nFor the policy to be judged a success, it will need to significantly cut Russias oil revenues. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Russia has been selling its oil at big discountsaround $20 or $30 below the Brent benchmark price.[2] At the very least, the price cap should lock in these discounts. The G7 will set the cap at a fixed price as opposed to a moving discount to Brent, but it reserves the right to alter its level at any time.\n\nIdeally, the price cap should require Russia to sell its oil with even steeper discounts than already exist on the marketplace. The United States has said that it plans to keep the price cap above Russias marginal cost of production, which the Russian government assesses at roughly $40 per barrel.[3] (Independent analysts believe Russias marginal cost of production may be much lower.[4]) The closer the cap pushes the price of Russian oil to $40 per barrel or even below that threshold, the more successful it will be, as it will signal that Putin is generating minimal profits from oil sales.\n\nAt the same time, to be judged a success, the price cap must not inadvertently cause a spike in global oil prices. How might that happen? With US sanctions, overcompliance is the norm. Instead of abiding by American sanctions regulations precisely, companies often stay well clear of the line. In the case of the price cap, overcompliance would look like traders, insurers, or shipping firms refusing to deal with Russian oil even if its sold for a price below the cap. The result could be a major drop in the supply of Russian oil available on the global market, which could increase prices for everyone. (Of course, if the supply of Russian oil is squeezed but global energy prices do not increase, that would not be a problem from the perspective of the G7.) Fears of overcompliance explain why senior US officials have made compliance expectations relatively simple[5] and have repeatedly downplayed the threat of American penalties when companies accidentally violate the policy.\n\nWhat would failure look like?\n\nThere are many ways the price cap could fail. For starters, if the price cap does not meaningfully reduce Russias oil revenues, it would be fair to question why the United States and other members of the G7 invested so much time and effort into the policy. While it may be tempting to keep the cap conservativefor instance, by maintaining it roughly in line with the current market price for Russian oildoing so would defeat the purpose of the policy.\n\nAnother way the cap could fail would be for buyers of Russian oil, including firms in China and India, to find full-scale supply chains for Russian oil that dont involve the G7 service providers that must adhere to the price cap. If Russia can sell all its oil without using any G7 services (including trading, commodities brokering, financing, shipping, insurance, flagging, and customs brokering), the cap will not exert any substantial pressure on Russias oil revenues. US officials have emphasized that Russia is free to sell oil without using any G7 services, but its doing so wouldnt represent policy success. On the contrary, it would demonstrate that a \"service providers cartel,\" as the G7 effort might be considered (see Part 1 of the Q&A), was ill-founded in the first place.\n\nA third way the cap could fail would be widespread evasion and undercompliance. If buyers of Russian oil find it simple to continue to use G7 services while surreptitiously paying Russia prices that exceed the cap, the policy will not just fail to cut Russias revenues, it will also damage the reputation of US sanctions. This is what happened in the 1990s when the UN set up the \"oil-for-food\" program with Iraq, which was riddled with corruption.[6] The Biden administration seems to fear overcompliance more than undercompliance. But if this expectation proves incorrect, Washington must be prepared to vigorously enforce the cap with penalties.\n\nCould Putin respond by just cutting off oil sales?\n\nYes, Putin himself could remove oil supplies from the global marketplace by shutting in large quantities of Russian oil. Putin is clearly not opposed to using energy as a weapon: he has cut gas supplies to the EU in recent months, a policy that has put pressure on both Europe and Russia.[7] With oil, however, Russias biggest customers are not in Europe but rather in China, India, and Turkey.[8] So if Putin decided to shut in oil production, it would not only grievously harm Russias own energy sector and its state finances, it would also inflict pain on Beijing, New Delhi, and Ankaragovernments that Moscow cannot afford to anger.\n\nAnyone who attempts to forecast Kremlin policy must have a healthy degree of humility. To be sure, Putin could decide to cut oil supplies despite these obvious downsides. Yet its not clear such a decision would mark policy failure. In fact, it could even be a welcome scenario for the G7 if it proves fiscally devastating for Moscow and the hardship caused by supply cuts turns the rest of the world decisively against Russia and its aggression in Ukraine.\n\nIf the current policy fails, are there ways the G7 could restructure the price cap or pursue a different approach to cut Russias oil revenues?\n\nThis initial price cap is just one arrow the G7 has in its quiver when it comes to depriving the Kremlin of its oil riches. If the problem with the price cap is either undercompliance or the establishment of reliable supply chains that avoid the G7 entirely, the G7 can strengthen the policy by threatening secondary sanctions against any company that buys Russian oil for a price above the cap. Legislation introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) would do just that.[9]\n\nThere are other policy options that dont rely on the price cap concept at all. For instance, if oil demand falls and pressure on supply eases, the G7 could attempt to cut the volume of oil that Russia sells as opposed to reducing the price of that oil. The United States has successfully imposed such restrictions on Iran for years. Starting in 2012, Washington threatened secondary sanctions against buyers of Iranian oil unless their home countries significantly reduced their total purchases of Irans oil every six months. This policy led to sharp declines in Irans oil salesfrom roughly 2.5 million barrels per day when the policy was instituted to well below 1 million barrels of oil per day at their low point.[10]\n\nAnother option is to use financial sanctions to block Russia from enjoying unfettered access to its oil revenues. Such a policy also has a precedent in the Iran context. Later in 2012, Capitol Hill pushed for the Obama administration to require all importers of Iranian oilincluding companies in China, India, and Turkeyto reduce their purchases to zero or face secondary sanctions. The Obama administration was wary of such a move, so a compromise was reached: Instead of pushing for purchases of Iranian oil to fall to zero, it would require all of Irans oil revenues to flow into restricted accounts, where the funds could only be used for bilateral trade in nonsanctioned goods as well as humanitarian-related products.[11] The policy was a huge success, locking up more than $100 billion of Iranian oil funds in restricted bank accounts.[12] This provided Washington with its best source of leverage in nuclear talks with Tehran. Theres no good reason the G7 couldnt dust off this policy and direct it at Russia.\n\nA fourth option would be an import tariff on Russian oila policy that several influential policy analysts in Europe favored over the price cap.[13] Regardless of what the best alternative to the price cap may be, the important point here is that there are plenty of alternative policies that could cut Russias oil revenues. So if the price cap fails, members of the G7 need not throw up their hands in defeat. They canand shouldgo back to the drawing board.\n\nNotes",

                "cc_text": "President Joe Bidens comments on Thursday that hed be open to diplomacy with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the war in Ukraine may have been more about signaling Western solidarity and shoring up the USs relationship with France than about entering into an imminent dialogue with Russia.\n\nBiden made the remarks during an official state visit from French President Emmanuel Macron, whose decision to try and engage Putin in talks during the course of the invasion has been met with little success, as well as some frustration with from allies like the US.\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson John Kirby clarified Bidens comments in a press briefing Friday, saying that although Biden was open to diplomacy with Putin should Russia come to the negotiating table with a reasonable position to end the war, thats not likely to happen soon. Russia in particular has not indicated that its serious about engaging in peace talks; in response to Bidens comments Thursday, Putin and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would engage in peace talks if Ukraine would meet their list of demands, which includes recognition of territories Russia has seized in southern Ukraine.\n\nThroughout the nearly 10 months since Russia illegally invaded Ukraine, aligning the priorities of the US and European Union nations has been a key aspect of the Western response to the war both in terms of material support for Ukraine and enforcing sanctions to cripple the Russian economy.\n\nThat hasnt always been easy, and Russian politicians and media try to exploit every division whether perceived or real within the transatlantic partnership to indicate that not only is its willingness to back Ukraine faltering, but the entire Western world order is headed toward collapse.\n\n\"Russia can exploit those disagreements, and they do. And they will,\" Donald Jensen, director for Russia and Europe at the US Institute of Peace, told Vox regarding the Russian political and media sphere. \"They see everything. Now sometimes, they misread things, sometimes they dont understand certain things about the West very well, and I think they miscalculated and underestimated the unity of the West behind Ukraine. But they do react to everything, and they talk about everything.\"\n\nBidens comments point toward solidarity with the West\n\nThough Kirby did clarify Bidens comments from Thursday, they werent substantially different from previous positions Biden has held on the peace process with Ukraine.\n\n\"Theres one way for the war to end: the rational way,\" Biden said during a joint press conference with Macron. In order for that to happen, Putin must pull out of Ukraine, Biden said, \"but it appears hes not going to do that.\" The president continued, \"Hes paying a very heavy price for refusing to do that, but hes inflicting incredible, incredible carnage on the civilian population of Ukraine bombing nurseries, hospitals, childrens homes. Its sick what hes doing.\"\n\nThat sentiment, too, comports with Bidens previous positions on the war, particularly in the wake of atrocities like the massacres in Bucha and Mariupol, committed by Russian troops during their occupation of those areas.\n\n\"Im prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding hes looking for a way to end the war,\" Biden said Thursday. \"He hasnt done that yet.\" The two leaders have not spoken since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 of this year, according to Reuters, although US government officials including National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin have spoken with their Russian counterparts in the intervening months.\n\nFor their part, Russian conditions for negotiations are much the same as they were in March, when it seemed as though Ukraine was willing to negotiate a settlement on Russian terms. However, Russia has lost significant territory and battlefield leverage since then as Ukraine successfully recaptured parts of Kharkiv Oblast and Kherson.\n\nPerhaps the more surprising development was Macrons assertion that he would not advocate for negotiations on terms unacceptable to Ukraine. Macron, who has kept open a line of communication with Putin throughout the war, received backlash from NATO allies in Eastern Europe over the summer for his comments that Russia \"should not be humiliated\" during the process of pursuing peace.\n\nThis time around, Jensen said, Macrons message has shifted. \"France has always wanted to have their own foreign policy profile,\" he said. \"But frankly a lot of people think [Macron] was humiliated by Putin and so hes come around to a position closer to the US, even as he wants to play his own role in global politics.\"\n\nIn response to a question about whether Macron and Biden had talked about pushing Ukraine to negotiate for an end to the war given the strain energy prices are expected to put on European households this winter, Macron reiterated the solidarity of Western nations against the Russian invasion and pointed to his countrys increased military, economic, and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Macron clearly stated that \"we will never urge the Ukrainians to make a compromise which will not be acceptable for them.\" Furthermore, he added, \"If we want a sustainable peace, we have to respect the Ukrainians to decide the moment and the conditions in which they will negotiate about their territory and their future.\"\n\nThe show of solidarity with Ukraine was important, according to Nicholas Lokker, a research assistant with the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, given that the US and France are working through disagreements about the clean energy provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\"I think there have been some concerns about the degree to which this dispute could impact the broader relationship, and potentially even cooperation on things like the response to the war in Ukraine,\" he said. \"This is a real issue, but at the same time, its not directly related to the response to the war and I think theres a recognition that you can have individual disputes on particular policies that do not need to compromise the entire relationship.\"\n\nKeeping a channel with Russia open is important, but dont expect peace talks soon\n\nDespite Bidens openness to talks with Putin, the experts Vox spoke to agreed that Russia has not made any serious move toward good-faith negotiations, and Biden himself said he didnt expect to talk to Putin any time soon.\n\n\"The Russian position has not evolved at all, except in a more demanding way,\" Steven Pifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Vox. \"Even though Russia has been losing on the battlefield since August, they implicitly upped their demands in September when they declared that they had annexed Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, even though they didnt control all of those territories. So theres no indication Ive seen that the Russians are prepared to moderate their position.\"\n\nIn the face of those battlefield disasters, Russia has increasingly targeted civilian infrastructure, murdering civilians, damaging roads, and destroying civilian energy structures, leaving large swathes of the population in places like Kyiv, Odesa, and Kherson without light, heat, or running water. The ongoing attacks, which Russia has claimed are aimed at keeping foreign weapons out of Ukraine, have been described by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as war crimes, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.\n\nStill, some members of the transatlantic alliance have kept the phone lines to the Kremlin open if only to admonish Putin, as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz did Friday. During the call, according to a tweet from the German embassy in the US, \"Scholz condemned Russias airstrikes against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and stressed Germanys determination to support Ukraine against Russian aggression. He urged Putin to withdraw his troops.\"\n\nChancellor Scholz had a call with President Putin. Scholz condemned Russia's airstrikes against civilian infrastructure in #Ukraine and stressed Germany's determination to support Ukraine against Russian aggression. He urged Putin to withdraw his troops. pic.twitter.com/T4vuakfMAb German Embassy (@GermanyinUSA) December 2, 2022\n\nEven if these lines of communication dont amount to negotiations over Russias invasion of Ukraine, theyre still critical to mitigating misunderstanding and miscalculations on the battlefield, Pifer said. \"There are those contacts that are, perhaps, useful in sending messages about, Look, we want to de-escalate things, we dont want to escalate. I think thats important to avoid miscalculation,\" particularly in a battlefield context in which Russia has threatened to use nuclear weapons, as Putin did earlier this year.\n\nBut even with the lines of communication open, there are serious issues which Russia and the transatlantic alliance desperately need to address and which, Jensen said, Russia is now trying to use as leverage. Planned talks around the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), as a sidebar to the COP27 conference in Sharm El Sheikh last week, were quashed when Russia attempted to tie in Ukraine negotiations.\n\nThe lack of movement on these kinds of issues, Jensen said, is a good indicator of where the US-Russia relationship is. \"Thats really more reflective of where we are now than something Biden said.\"",

                "cc_text": "Can we imagine a Russia without Vladimir Putin?\n\nFor so long his grip on power has seemed unshakeable. And yet is it now time to think the unthinkable - the prospect of a power struggle that is of Putins own making? In other words; a Kremlin succession.\n\nPutin has started not just a war in Ukraine but a war for his crown. That is the view of a former British ambassador to Russia.\n\nHas Vladimir Putin triggered a succession war?\n\nPresident Putins spokesman brushed off the suggestion but admitted, \"of course, we are all thinking about the future.\"\n\nITV News spoke to six experts long-time Kremlin watchers, current and former western officials and President Putins own spokesman about the man who has ruled Russia for more than two decades.\n\nIsolated, and perhaps increasingly paranoid after Covid, the Putin of 2022 is very different from the young, former intelligence officer pushing western values who was handed the Russian presidency.\n\nPutins broken promises\n\n\"The state will stand firm to protect freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of mass media,\" Putin pledged on a cold and snowy night in the final minutes of December 1999.\n\nThis was the new presidents first address to the Russian nation, promising a path out of the darkness and into a bright future based on the principles of democracy and reform.\n\nVladimir Putin promised freedom when he came to power in 1999. Credit: AP\n\nIt was a bold commitment. It had only been eight years since Russians threw off seven decades of repressive Communist rule, and the experience had been traumatic at best.\n\nFreedom had brought severe hardship, rocketing levels of crime and an economy drowning in debt. The plummeting rouble rendered ordinary Russians savings worthless.\n\nYet Putin was resolute that the freedoms he articulated that New Year's Eve were \"fundamental elements of a civilised society\" - and that they would be his country's way toward \"love and peace in every home\" in the new millennium.\n\nTwenty-two years later, Russia's leader has abandoned those principles, as he leads his country headfirst into another existential crisis - this time of his own creation.\n\nInstead of delivering on his promises, Putin has presided over a system in which his opponents have been murdered or jailed during brutal crackdowns. There is no freedom of speech.\n\nPutin has now brought death and destruction to Ukraine and shattered the veneer of peace in Russia by mobilising his population; bringing the war to their doorsteps.\n\nUnder expanding western sanctions, Russias future possibly looks bleaker now than when Putin inherited it after the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nFiona Hill, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and advisor on Russia to three US presidents, told ITV News that Putin took power, \"promising prosperity and making Russia great again.\"\n\nThe war in Ukraine has been dragging on since Russia's invasion on February 24 Credit: AP\n\n\"He did not promise unpredictability, lack of prosperity and destruction.\"\n\nNow, for the first time in many years, there are signs Putin himself may be under threat from his ill-judged war.\n\nPutins invasion of Ukraine has \"fundamentally changed the political and social contract in Russia in ways that make it much harder to keep the country stable and to manage intra-elite stability,\" said Sir Laurie Bristow, British Ambassador to Russia from 2016 to 2020.\n\n\"Im starting to describe this war now as leading into a war of Russias succession,\" Bristow said.\n\n\"The bulldogs [Russian elites] are fighting under the carpet, and they're fighting over money and power and potentially access to force,\" Bristow said.\n\nThe Kremlin sees no such danger.\n\n\"Its not true,\" Dmitry Peskov, President Putins spokesman, told ITV News.\n\n'Putin does not care about casualty figures'\n\nThe Russian opposition-in-exile calls the war in Ukraine the \"meat grinder.\" In recent months, Putin has called up 300,000 of his countrymen to fight and far more than that number have fled abroad.\n\nThe United States has said Russia has seen more than 100,000 soldiers killed or wounded in Ukraine.\n\nThere have been widespread reports of Russian troops being sent to war with almost no training, rusty weapons and being told to use female sanitary products instead of military first aid kits.\n\nOutraged at mobilisation and the expectation that men could be plucked from their homes, or even the streets to fight, Russians defied harsh laws cracking down on criticism of the war to sporadically protest across the country, briefly, in September for the first time in months.\n\nThe war has been particularly bloody with analysts suggesting Russia has lost as many men in nine months in Ukraine as the USSR did during ten years of war in Afghanistan following the Soviet invasion in 1979.\n\n\"Putin does not care about casualty figures. This is his point of leverage,\" said Ms Hill.\n\nInstead, Putin is said to be concerned with his popularity ratings.\n\nPutin recently sat down with Russian mothers who had lost their sons in the war. Credit: AP\n\nWorried about social unrest, the Kremlin \"carefully watches the reaction of the Russian population,\" to events in Ukraine, a former journalist in the Kremlin media pool told ITV News.\n\n\"Putin is obsessed with his ratings. When his ratings are going down, he starts to hide from uncomfortable questions to remove responsibility for the failures.\"\n\nPossibly for that reason, Putin recently cancelled his annual press conference for the first time in a decade as the Kremlin faces growing unease over the war.\n\nShortly after invading Ukraine, Putins approval rating jumped significantly but since August, it has dropped, according to the Russian polling organisation Levada Center.\n\nMeduza, an independent Russian news organisation operating from Latvia, recently reported that a leaked opinion poll commissioned by the Kremlin showed only a quarter of people support continuing the war.\n\nAlthough willing to send his countrymen to their deaths, Putin has severely limited his contact with the general Russian public since launching his war in February, possibly fearing a backlash from grieving families.\n\nPutin recently met a group of soldiers mothers reportedly handpicked for their loyalty to the Kremlin.\n\nIn a highly controlled meeting, he tried to convince the Russian public that he cares about the men he has sent to fight and die - fuelling the narrative spun by state television that it is Russias Ministry of Defence, not Putin, which is responsible for failures in Ukraine.\n\nAt a table with individual teapots and sweet treats, Putin told the women he shared their pain before saying to one mother in an attempt at sympathy, \"some people die of vodka, and their lives go unnoticed. But your son really lived and achieved his goal. He didn't die in vain.\"\n\nBefore leaving, he also warned the women they should not believe \"fakes\" or \"lies\" about the war on the internet or on television.\n\nIt was an indication that even Putin realises the cracks in his war are beginning to show.\n\nEven in Russia, where state television beams the Kremlins narrative into homes across 11 time-zones, it has been impossible to completely cover up Russias failures in Ukraine.\n\nNor the fact that Russias Special Military Operation to denazify and demilitarise Ukraine has now entered its eleventh month.\n\nNor that, in November, the army had to abandon a regional capital which Putin had declared part of Russia not much more than a month before.\n\n\"Across the whole world and in our country too, the people who do this look like clowns,\" Maksim Yusin, a journalist and political commentator said on a Russian television show.\n\n\"That clownery is now just indecentI dont know which part of the elite is responsible for this.\"\n\nThe answer, of course, is Putin.\n\nPutin started 'plotting' Ukraine invasion during Covid\n\nWhile Russia was ravaged by Covid-19 and sustained some of the highest death rates in the world, Putin was accused by some Russian media as living in a bunker in a bid to escape the virus.\n\nHis press secretary, Peskov, denied the rumours and said Putin was working at his house outside Moscow in Novo-Ogaryovo.\n\nDuring this personal lockdown, Putin wrote a five thousand word essay On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians, published on the Kremlin website.\n\n\"He basically spent his whole time thinking about this,\" Ms Hill said. \"Covid changed him because he sat and stewed in his own juices. It's clear that he started really plotting this [the invasion] during Covid.\"\n\nNovo-Ogaryovo is close to central Moscow but it may as well be \"on another planet,\" one visitor told ITV News.\n\nDescribing it as \"quite lonely,\" they said guests must pass multiple security checkpoints before they reach the main buildings. During the pandemic, visitors reportedly had to quarantine for two weeks to see Putin face-to-face.\n\nWith fewer in-person meetings, Putin turned his attention away from the present and towards the past, said Hill, becoming even more obsessed with Russian history.\n\nAfter the publication of his essay, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine joked he was \"envious\" that Putin had so much free time on his hands to write \"such a volume of detailed work.\"\n\n\"Covid hardened him,\" said Ms Hill, pointing out that during the pandemic a number of key people left the presidential administration. \"He got a lot less information that might come from diverse sources during that period.\"\n\nPutin uses the internet more as a \"tool for surveillance\" than for acquisition of knowledge, Ms Hill said.\n\nWith restricted access to information, some analysts believe Putins ongoing isolation during Covid may have exacerbated his natural paranoia.\n\nAs the former head of the FSB, Putin \"has always been looking over his shoulder,\" a Russian political scientist with knowledge of the Kremlin told ITV News.\n\n\"Its a part of his mentality. His profession suggests conspiracy thinking should be there. Covid may have affected this.\"\n\nWith a shrinking circle of aides and limited contact with the outside world, multiple analysts have speculated that the make-up of Putins advisors altered during Covid, setting in motion changes in the current balance of power around the Kremlin.\n\nSurrounding Putin: war-hungry hardliners\n\nPutin has carefully curated a strongman image flying a fighter jet, posing shirtless on a fishing holiday in the Siberian wilderness and showing off his judo moves with Russian Olympic athletes.\n\nNow, for the first time in decades, his strength is being questioned.\n\nAlthough CIA director William Burns joked in the summer that Putin was \"too healthy,\" there are swirling, although unverified, rumours Putin is ill fuelling questions about infighting around the Kremlin.\n\n\"There's definitely a major crisis to the system,\" said Ms Hill. \"Putin over-stretched himself. Now people see he is fallible.\"\n\nPutins system relies on a strong leader who takes all the key decisions and can hold the country, and its elites, together. When faith in him falters, Russias whole system of government risks falling apart.\n\n\"We are certainly seeing signs that the elite do not think the war is going to plan and they are trying to assert themselves in different ways,\" a senior western official said recently.\n\nThe Russian political scientist told ITV News that the \"transition period has started in the sense that the balance of powers around the leadership is changing. Warlords are getting stronger and technocrats are getting weaker.\"\n\n\"The president has always tried to keep an equilibrium between the two groups. Now, that might turn out to be impossible.\"\n\nAs the power shifts around the Kremlin, two men who are vocal supporters of the war are making a bid for more influence.\n\nChechen Ramzan Kadyrov's influence is growing. Credit: AP\n\nEvgeny Prigozhin, who runs the Wagner paramilitary group, and Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, are both long-time Putin supporters and have both committed forces to fight in Ukraine.\n\nTogether, they \"arguably have better access to Putin than some ministers from the economic block of the government,\" the Russian political scientist said.\n\nPrigozhin has been sanctioned by the US for his role in running a troll factory, which spread disinformation online during the 2016 US election which saw Donald Trump elected.\n\nHe also recently visited a Russian prison recruiting men to be mercenaries in Ukraine. Kadyrov, known for his ruthless rule in Chechnya, has sent hundreds of his henchmen, known as the Kadyrovtsy, to Ukraine and has also vowed to send his teenage sons to fight.\n\nNeither is the sort of man anyone in the Kremlin would want to have as their enemy - but both have been publicly allowed to criticise the performance of the Russian army in Ukraine.\n\nKadyrov recently described a general who he blamed for defeats as \"talentless,\" saying he should be sent back to the frontline as a private and \"made to wash off his shame with blood.\"\n\nUnlike Prigozhin and Kadyrov, the Russian political scientist said, the ministers and advisors dealing with the economic fallout of the invasion, \"tend to take a more flexible and softer position.\"\n\n\"We do not hear a lot from Mr [Sergey] Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow. Or people from federal ministries and agencies who deal with economic issues. They will not express opposition views, of course, but the fact that they do not discuss these issues directly might suggest they have reservations.\"\n\nWant a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories? Listen to our latest podcasts to find out What You Need To Know\n\nOne recognisable figure mooted as making a bid for a bigger role is Dmitry Medvedev, who served as Russian president from 2008 to 2012 in a job swap with Putin to allow the Russian leader to circumvent constitutional limits against serving three consecutive terms.\n\nNow Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council, Medvedev may be angling for a promotion if Putin names a successor, two people who spoke to ITV News suggested.\n\n\"He is a consensus figure among Russian elites with money,\" the former Kremlin pool journalist said, adding that groups close to Putin, including influential friends from Putins hometown of St Petersburg, see Medvedev, who is also from the city, as a potential option.\n\nYet Medvedev is not immune to the impact of Putins war.\n\nOnce known in the west as a liberal moderniser, Medvedev has rebranded himself as a hardliner. He recently compared Russias struggle in Ukraine to a conflict against \"Satan\" and warned Moscow could send all its enemies into eternal fire.\n\nUnlike President Putin, Medvedev is a prolific user of the internet and frequently uses his Telegram channel to transmit his bloody messages.\n\nWatchers see this conspicuous display of loyalty as intentional and calculating.\n\nMedvedev, the former Kremlin pool journalist said, \"wasnt electable among patriots and Russians who are in the pro-war camp. This rhetoric helps get through to them. Thats why he is putting all this stuff on his Telegram channel. Its a very well-done electoral calculation.\"\n\nAlthough any mention of successors to the Russian president, including Medvedev, is possibly premature and highly speculative, analysts and sources who spoke to ITV News agreed that the fact that such discussion is even underway shows Putin is under immense pressure.\n\nThe next election is due in 2024. Credit: AP\n\nRussias next scheduled election is in 2024 and the Russian constitution has now been re-written to allow Putin to be sworn in as president for a third consecutive term.\n\nWhile no one seriously expects Putin not to stand if he is physically and politically able, even his spokesperson indicated it is a topic not currently under discussion.\n\n\"2024 is not an issue which is on our agenda. Its not on the table. This is an issue for those politologists and other people who earn their money chewing over these topics,\" Dmitry Peskov told ITV News.\n\n\"Of course, we are all thinking about the future. But this is not an urgent issue right now. We are preoccupied with different things,\" Peskov added.\n\nPeskov did not elaborate on what those \"things\" might be. Among them on the Kremlins agenda, surely, is maintaining stability in Russia at a time when Russia has been slammed for its failures in Ukraine.\n\n\"The stress on Putin must be acute right now. This is a war that he is completely responsible for and he knows that people will be out to get him,\" Ms Hill told ITV News.\n\nPutins gamble: who can take the pain for longer?\n\nFaced with a shrinking toolkit of options for pursuing a war beset by supply problems, reportedly low troop morale and an economy under western sanctions Putin is weaponising the weather. Even allies of Russia, such as China, have urged Russia to de-escalate.\n\nInstead, Russia has relentlessly targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure in a bid to freeze the country into submission, pressure Europe with sky high gas prices and another refugee crisis.\n\n\"His way out is to get everybody else to push Ukraine towards the negotiating table and to accept the [front] lines as they are now,\" Ms Hill said.\n\n\"Putin thinks he can break everyone's resolve because the risks of nuclear war and escalation are too high that they [the west] cant stomach the carnage.\"\n\nSir Laurie warned that the consequences of capitulating to Putin are far greater than any hardships suffered from an energy and cost of living crisis.\n\n\"If Putin wins, it means everything we have taken for granted about the security of the UK since 1945 no longer holds,\" Bristow said.\n\n\"If a country takes it into its head to seize and take over another country and nothing gets done about it, it shows we are not willing to stand up for our own security.\"\n\nAlthough Ukraine has declared the war will be over by next spring, multiple Western officials have said they expect it to become a grinding \"war of attrition\" dragging on long into next year and possibly the year after.\n\n\"Russia is seeking to break Ukrainians will to resist but also to raise the cost to us of supporting Ukraine,\" Bristow said.\n\nPutin, he said, \"is clearly counting on time and ultimately western election cycles working in his favour.\"\n\nIn November Mr Trump announced his third bid for the White House. Credit: AP\n\nThe US midterm elections have already revealed cracks in the resolve of Ukraines biggest donor to keep funding the war: a faction of the Republican Party is calling for a possible reduction in funds to Ukraine.\n\nDonald Trump, dubbed the Kremlin candidate by some media, will also run for the presidency again in 2024.\n\n\"The chaos is already emerging with Trump in the United States,\" said Ms Hill, who advised Trump while he was in the White House in her capacity as Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs on the National Security Council.\n\nMs Hill testified during Trumps first impeachment trial where Trump was accused of withholding military aid to Ukraine in order to get Zelensky to dig up dirt on his political rival Joe Biden.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy leaves after attending a national flag-raising ceremony in the freed Izium, Ukraine. Credit: AP\n\nTrump, who has criticised the large scale of aid the United States is providing to Ukraine, has previously boasted of his relationship with Putin and urged peace talks.\n\nThat could create the type of division and chaos the Russian president is counting on consuming the west politically in order to create opportunities on the battlefield that he can exploit.\n\n\"Putins calculation is to wait it out, increase the pain and work on public opinion,\" Sir Laurie said.\n\n\"We should be ready for a period of turbulence, uncertainty and risk in dealing with Russia.\"\n\nThe question is whether Putin can hold on long enough in Ukraine, and at home, for his strategy to work.\n\nPutins weapons arsenal has been ground down by months of relentless strikes on Ukraine, forcing Russia to desperately source replenishments from Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe weather is also Putins enemy.\n\nPutins soldiers reportedly have had to source their own socks and hats while, in contrast, Canada is sending millions of dollars of winter clothing to the Ukrainian army.\n\nShivering in trenches, fighting for a paycheck, some Russian soldiers are wondering why they are there at all.\n\nAt home, however, Putin has successfully stifled dissent. He has used the war to intensify his crackdown against the Russian opposition - almost all of whom are now in jail or abroad.\n\nThe economy has been mobilised to support the war effort, increasing the influence of the defence sector over parts of civilian life.\n\nGambling on his army still occupying swathes of Ukraines territory and his ability to bear the pain for longer than the west, Putin still hopes to maintain an iron grip on power and to rule as president until 2036 when he would be 83.\n\nOnly a fool would underestimate his survival ability, but his rule no longer looks as inevitable as it once did.\n\n\"He still thinks hes got game yet. You should never count him out.\" Ms Hill said.\n\n\"But people are starting to think whether its likely he will make it to 2036.the odds are not in his favour anymore.\"",

Eaton, 48, was arrested Sunday, a day after the shooting outside his apartment building near the University of Vermont campus. He appeared in court Monday by video from jail, speaking only to confirm his identity. His attorney entered pleas of not guilty on his behalf, and a judge ordered him held without bail pending a hearing that likely will be held in the next few days.\n\nAccording to a police affidavit, federal agents found a shotgun in Eatons apartment. He refused to identify himself but told the officers he had been waiting for them.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said Monday the Justice Department is investigating whether the shooting was a hate crime. The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are assisting Vermont authorities in the investigation.\n\nThere has been a sharp increase in threats directed against Jewish, Muslim, and Arab communities across the US since the Israel-Hamas war began, he said. \"There is understandable fear in communities across the country,\" Garland said.\n\nThe three men, all age 20, were walking during a visit to the home of one of the victims relatives when they were confronted by a white man with a handgun, police said.\n\n\"Without speaking, he discharged at least four rounds from the pistol and is believed to have fled,\" Murad said. \"All three victims were struck, two in their torsos and one in the lower extremities.\"\n\nTwo of the men were in stable condition and the other suffered \"much more serious injuries,\" Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad said in a statement Sunday.\n\nTwo of the victims are US citizens and the third is in the country with legal permission. Two of the men were wearing the black-and-white Palestinian keffiyeh scarves, Murad said.\n\nThe Institute for Middle East Understanding, in a statement from victims families on X, formerly known as Twitter, identified the men as Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ali Ahmad.\n\n\"We are extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of our children,\" the statement said. \"We call on law enforcement to conduct a thorough investigation, including treating this as a hate crime. We will not be comfortable until the shooter is brought to justice.\"\n\nThe three men had been staying at Awartanis grandmothers house for Thanksgiving, Awartani told police. They had gone bowling earlier Saturday and were returning when a man walked up to them, pulled out a gun and started shooting, he said.\n\nA second victim told police he saw a man staring at them from the porch of a white house. Abdalhamid told police that the man stumbled down the stairs and pulled out a pistol.\n\nRich Price, Awartanis uncle, said the gunman \"shot them without saying any words\" and all three are now in the ICU.\n\nBurlington Mayor Miro Weinberger is expected to join Murad at a press conference Monday to discuss the investigation. Murad, who expressed sympathies for the victims and their families, said there is no additional information to suggest a motive.\n\n\"In this charged moment, no one can look at this incident and not suspect that it may have been a hate-motivated crime. And I have already been in touch with federal investigatory and prosecutorial partners to prepare for that if its proven,\" he said.\n\n\"The fact is that we dont yet know as much as we want to right now,\" Murad added. \"But I urge the public to avoid making conclusions based on statements from uninvolved parties who know even less.\"\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting and would continue to receive law enforcement updates.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations released a statement offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest or conviction of the person or people responsible for the shootings.\n\nRamallah Friends School posted a statement on Facebook saying the three young men were graduates of the private school, in the West Bank.\n\n\"While we are relieved to know that they are alive, we remain uncertain about their condition and hold them in the light,\" the school said. \"We stand united in hope and support for their well-being during this challenging time.\"\n\nIn response to the shooting, US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries encouraged people to \"unequivocally denounce the startling rise of anti-Arab hate and Islamophobia in America.\"\n\n\"No one should ever be targeted for their ethnicity or religious affiliation in our country,\" the New York Democrat said in the statement posted on X. \"We will not let hatred win.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent, also denounced the shooting.\n\n\"It is shocking and deeply upsetting that three young Palestinians were shot here in Burlington, VT. Hate has no place here, or anywhere. I look forward to a full investigation,\" Sanders said in a statement.\n\nGov. Phil Scott called the shooting a tragedy, calling on the states residents to unite and \"not let this incident incite more hate or divisiveness.\"\n\nThe Vermont-New Hampshire chapter of Jewish Voice For Peace, which has urged an end to the Israel-Hamas war, released a statement saying it was \"appalled by the shooting.\"\n\n\"We are in solidarity with the students, their families and all those affected by this clear act of hate,\" the organization said Sunday. \"We are in solidarity with all Palestinian people in occupied Palestine, around the world, and here in Vermont and we are committed to creating a Vermont that is safe and welcoming for all.\"\n\nThe American Jewish Committee, an advocacy organization for Jewish people worldwide, also said via X it was \"horrified\" by the attack and urged \"law enforcement to investigate this act as a possible hate crime.\"\n\nLast month, an Illinois landlord was charged with a hate crime after being accused of fatally stabbing a 6-year-old Muslim boy and seriously wounding his mother in suburban Chicago. Police and relatives said he singled out the victims because of their faith.\n\nDemonstrations have been widespread and tensions in the US have escalated as the death toll rises in the Israel-Hamas war. A fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas was back on track Sunday as the militants freed more hostages and Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners. It was the third exchange under a four-day truce deal.",

What can you say? There is a question of trust,\" Putin said. \"And trust, of course, is almost at zero.\"\n\nPutin had been asked about remarks by former German chancellor Angela Merkel, one of the agreements' sponsors, who told the Zeit magazine in an interview published on Wednesday that the 2014 agreement had been \"an attempt to give Ukraine time\" - which it had used to become more able to defend itself.\n\nRussian media and politicians have quickly construed this as a betrayal on Merkel's part.\n\n\"It turns out that no one was going to fulfil all these Minsk agreements,\" Putin said, \"and the point was only to pump up Ukraine with weapons and prepare it for hostilities.\"\n\n\"After a statement like that, the question arises of how to negotiate, about what, and is it possible to negotiate with someone, and where are the guarantees,\" he added.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin attends a news conference following the Eurasian Economic Union summit in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, December 9, 2022. Sputnik/Sergei Bobylyov/Pool via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights\n\n\"An agreement will have to be reached in the end, all the same. I have said many times that we are ready for these agreements, we are open, but this makes us think who we are dealing with.\"\n\nNO WIDER THAW\n\nBoth Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov and Deputy Defence minister Sergei Ryabkov had already stressed on Friday that Thursday's release of U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner from a Russian penal colony in exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout did not portend a wider thaw in poor bilateral relations.\n\nBut Putin did say Russia was open to further such swaps, and that contacts between the respective intelligence services that agreed the Griner-Bout deal were continuing.\n\n\"In fact, they have never stopped,\" he said. \"A compromise was found; we do not reject continuing this work in the future.\"\n\nOn Nov. 14, Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin and U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns met in the Turkish capital Ankara in the highest-level face-to-face contact between the two sides since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nA White House spokesperson said afterwards that Burns had not conducted negotiations or discussed any settlement of the war in Ukraine, but warned Russia not to endanger strategic stability by using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and raised the cases of Americans detained in Russia.\n\nNaryshkin said afterwards that he and Burns had discussed Ukraine and nuclear security.\n\nWriting by Kevin Liffey; Editing by Nick Macfie\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The incoming Republican House majority has signaled it will be more skeptical of a \"blank check\" for Ukraine and will want more accountability about how U.S. weapons are distributed and used. Some GOP lawmakers could try to block economic and military aid or limit U.S. troop presence.\n\nThe Pentagon has a couple of dozen U.S. troops in Ukraine, including a very small number already assigned to making sure weapons reach their intended recipients. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other military leaders want to enhance the accountability mission and make sure there are experts in country to help Ukraine use critical weapons systems, including air defense and counter-drone systems.\n\nEfforts to track weapons in Ukraine have shown very little evidence of systems being diverted, the officials said, but so far the troops assigned to the mission in Ukraine have been able to visit only two locations outside Kyiv to check on the use of U.S. supplies. While the U.S. troops do not travel to the front lines, they would travel outside Kyiv to scan bar codes on weapons and equipment to track supplies. Pentagon and military leaders want to enable more visits.\n\nThe officials said they would like to pick up the pace of the weapons check before January, when there will be more pressure for accountability from House Republicans.\n\nIn a statement, the Pentagon press secretary, Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, said: \"The U.S. remains steadfast in its support of Ukraine and its ability to defend against Russias unprovoked aggression, and the U.S. presence at Embassy Kyiv reflects that enduring commitment. As soon as security conditions permitted in late May, DoD reopened its Defense Attach Office (DAO) and Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) at the Embassy in Kyiv to perform mission critical functions. DoD coordinates its personnel levels in connection with the State Department and interagency, as part of the overall Embassy footprint. We will continue to review our presence in-country, as security conditions evolve. Though the ODC is embedded within the U.S. Embassy, it is staffed exclusively by DoD personnel. For operational security and force protection reasons, we wont discuss specific numbers of personnel.\"\n\nUkrainian soldiers fire a mortar launcher Friday at a position along the front line in Donetsk. Ihor Tkachov / AFP - Getty Images\n\nThe senior U.S. officials stressed that any new troop presence would be limited and modest, most likely in the single digits. In addition to security concerns, they said, sustaining people in Kyiv remains challenging, with finite space and an unreliable supply of essentials like running water and electricity.\n\nThe State Department also caps how many U.S. government officials civilian and military can live and work in other countries, and that limit is low in Ukraine, officials say. Some could live and work in neighboring countries and travel in for missions if the cap is not raised, the officials said, but an increase could also spark criticism from Republicans and others that the Biden administration is pushing the limits of a pledge not to send U.S. troops to Ukraine.\n\n\"This is classic mission creep,\" a former U.S. official said.\n\n\"Thats ridiculous,\" a U.S. defense official said, explaining that it is an \"extremely limited\" additional presence with a \"very specific\" mission. \"This is about supporting the Ukrainians, not fighting the Russians.\"",

(@ZelenskyyUa) December 11, 2022\n\nSuccessive Russian missile and drone attacks have destroyed much of the countrys energy infrastructure, leaving millions of civilians without power and heating at a time when temperatures are at or below freezing.\n\nZelenskyy said he had thanked Biden for the \"unprecedented defence and financial\" assistance the United States had provided and talked about Ukraines need for effective anti-aircraft defence systems to protect its people.\n\n\"We also appreciate the help that the USA is providing to restore Ukraines energy system,\" he said.\n\nHe said Ukraine would be participating in the G7 meeting and that following the call Kyiv had \"coordinated our positions with America\".\n\nIn a statement afterwards, the White House said Biden stressed the US was making efforts to boost Ukraines air defences a priority.\n\nMore sanctions\n\nThe energy crunch also formed a key part of Zelenskyys earlier discussions with Frances Macron and Turkeys Erdogan.\n\nZelenskyy described his more than one-hour conversation with Macron as \"very meaningful\" and covering \"defence, energy, economy, diplomacy\".\n\nMeanwhile, he also thanked Turkey for providing shelter to Ukrainian children and deploying hundreds of generators to cities across the country.\n\nThe Ukrainian president also said he and Erdogan discussed the possible expansion of the grain export deal that opened up Ukrainian ports for exports in July after a six-month de facto Russian blockade.\n\nTurkey, which acted as a mediator in peace talks in the early months of the war, worked alongside the United Nations on that agreement.\n\nErdogans office said the Turkish leader also spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday and had called for a quick end to the conflict.\n\nPutin last week warned of a protracted war, speaking of Moscows near-total loss of trust in Western countries which he said would make an eventual settlement over Ukraine much harder to reach.\n\nMacron has championed diplomacy in the conflict but has unnerved Kyiv, some allies and the Baltic countries with what they see as his mixed messages: that it was up to Kyiv to decide when to negotiate with Moscow, but also that security guarantees were needed for Russia.\n\nThe EU foreign ministers will discuss a ninth package of sanctions that could add almost 200 more individuals and entities to the EU sanctions list, as well as an additional 2 billion euros ($2.11bn) for arms deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThere are no ongoing peace talks and no end in sight to the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two.\n\nMoscow shows no signs of being ready to respect Ukraines sovereignty and pre-war borders, saying the four regions it claims to have annexed from Ukraine in September are part of Russia \"forever\".\n\nThe government in Kyiv has ruled out conceding any land to Russia in return for peace.\n\nOn the ground in Ukraine, soldiers are dug in along the front line in the east amid continued shelling and Zelenskyy said over the weekend that Russian attacks had left the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut in ruins.\n\nThe situation \"remains very difficult\" in several front-line cities in eastern Ukraines Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, which together make up the provinces of the industrial Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Kyiv since 2014.",

Freedom of religion or belief for all remains a long-standing priority for the UK Government.\n\nCrown copyright 2022\n\nThis publication is licensed under the terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0 except where otherwise stated.\n\nWhere we have identified any third party copyright information you will need to obtain permission from the copyright holders concerned.\n\nThis publication is available at www.gov.uk/official-documents.\n\nAny enquiries regarding this publication should be sent to us at Communications Team, OSHR Directorate, Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, King Charles Street, SW1A 2AH.\n\nISBN 978-1-5286-3402-1. 12/22\n\nPreface by the Foreign Secretary James Cleverly\n\nIn recent months, we have seen alarming human rights violations and abuses across the world. The Iranian regime is trying to quash demonstrations by young women in defence of their freedom, while the Taliban turns back the clock on womens and girls rights in Afghanistan. Putin has brought terror to the lives of Ukrainians and ripped up international law to challenge their right to self-determination. Security forces in Myanmar have killed over 2 thousand people and detained thousands more since the military coup. Uyghur Muslims continue to face horrific persecution in China.\n\nI believe in the power of honest leadership and open societies to create a world where democracies prevail over autocracies, ensuring respect for individual rights and freedoms. Democracies need to work together to achieve this. Thats why we are creating a network of partnerships with like-minded nations, bound by economic, diplomatic and security ties, and by our collective drive to uphold our values and face down aggression for a freer world.\n\nPromoting respect for human rights, freedom and democracy has been an integral part of the work I have been privileged to do throughout my time as a Minister in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. As Foreign Secretary, it is an honour to continue that work with my Ministerial Team, making long-term, sustainable gains on the human rights frontier.\n\nThis report, covering 2021, highlights how some governments used the lingering impacts of the pandemic to justify the restriction of individuals rights, like the freedoms of peaceful assembly, association and expression. Against this backdrop, 2021 was a year of continued UK action to champion open societies, human rights and the rule of law.\n\nWe used our Presidency of the G7 to highlight causes such as the right to freedom of religion or belief and media freedom, we imposed human rights sanctions to hold those who violate and abuse human rights to account, and we used our financial programming to further our objectives to combat modern slavery, sexual violence in conflict and much more.\n\nIn 2022, our resolve to see flourishing open societies where people can enjoy their rights has only strengthened. Women and girls remain at the heart of foreign and development policy. We continue to push for stronger international action to Prevent Sexual Violence in Conflict by hosting the PSVI international conference in November 2022, delivering a new Political Declaration to steer international work, and ensuring work continues to provide accountability for such crimes.\n\nWe will not rest in the face of alarming human rights violations in China - particularly in Xinjiang and Tibet - and in other parts of the world such as Myanmar and Sudan. And we must continue to confront the urgent situation in Ukraine, where war crimes are alleged on an industrial scale. Putins forces have used weapons indiscriminately in populated areas, killing civilians, and there have been reports of abhorrent gender-based violence in Bucha and other regions formerly under the control of Russian armed forces. Those responsible will be held accountable.\n\nAs the people of Ukraine face Russias rockets, the people of Russia and Belarus face a barrage of attacks on their basic freedoms. We do not blame nor hold the innocent citizens of these countries accountable for their countries actions, but place this squarely with the regimes violating their human rights.\n\nThe UK believes in freedom and the rule of law. All countries, including the UK, need to remain vigilant on the journey to protect those basic building blocks of democracy as our societies develop and deal with technological and other changes. The international rules-based system is critical to protecting and realising the human rights and freedoms of people all over the world. We will strive to protect and advance universal human rights in the multilateral arena, competing on the world stage for what we believe is right.\n\nWhen autocrats and those who seek to do harm are bold, we must be bolder. We want to see people live in freedom, not fear. The UK is strengthening networks old and new, building a global family united by the values of freedom, human rights and the rule of law. Together we are determined that every person, in every nation, enjoys a brighter, freer future.\n\nForeword by the Minister for Human Rights, Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon\n\n2021 was a turbulent year for human rights and the rule of law around the world. Authoritarianism continued to creep in the shadow of the pandemic, and independent and critical voices continued to be supressed.\n\nThis year, Putins brand of authoritarianism has marched to a terrifying new beat. His foreign aggression mirrors ruthless repression at home.\n\nMore than ever, we must restate our belief in democracy, open societies and freedom, and stand up for human rights for everyone, everywhere.\n\nThis Report looks at the human rights landscape across the world in 2021. It includes a section on our Human Rights Priority Countries, those which either have particular challenges or are on a negative or positive trajectory. It highlights the work the UK Government has done to champion human rights and those who defend them.\n\nThe Taliban takeover of Afghanistan was a serious blow for human rights in the country. Women and girls saw the freedoms they had fought for over the last 20 years abruptly curtailed. Other marginalised groups, including religious minorities, faced increased persecution.\n\nI have been privileged to hear the first-hand accounts of brave Afghan women, including human rights defenders and members of minority groups, and to speak at the UN Security Council and UN Human Rights Council in support of their rights. FCDO officials will continue to use our engagement with the Taliban to press them to respect the human rights of all Afghans.\n\nThe UK Government has continued to take action in response to human rights violations in China, including imposing sanctions in response to the continuing violations in Xinjiang such as mass incarceration, forced labour and forced birth control.\n\nWe imposed further sanctions on Belarus in response to their fraudulent election and subsequent human rights violations, including in response to the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight in an unacceptable act of interference.\n\nIn Ethiopia, there have been further harrowing reports of systematic killing of civilians, ethnic discrimination, and reports of widespread rape, including of children. UK programming continued to help tackle conflict-related sexual violence there, and we have deployed UK experts to support the response.\n\nAs the Prime Ministers Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict, I have spearheaded the Governments work to tackle impunity, strengthen justice and enhance support for survivors and children born of such violence.\n\nAt the Human Rights Council, we quickly secured Special Sessions on the human rights situations in Myanmar and Sudan, following coups in those countries. The Session on Myanmar adopted a consensus resolution deploring the removal of the government and the Session on Sudan mandated a designated expert to ensure human rights monitoring in Sudan.\n\nWorking alongside the Prime Ministers Special Envoy on Freedom of religion or Belief, Fiona Bruce MP, we have galvanised international action in support of repressed groups and individuals by playing a leading role in the UN , G7 and the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance, and through hosting an International Ministerial Conference this year.\n\nThe appointment of the Prime Ministers Special Envoy for LGBT+ rights, the Rt Hon Lord Herbert of South Downs, has strengthened the UKs global efforts to defend the rights of LGBT+ people and ensure everyone, everywhere can live without fear of violence or discrimination.\n\nSupporting media freedom and journalists continues to be a priority. We remain an influential member of the Media Freedom Coalition and continue to call out attacks against journalists and news organisations.\n\nThe UK Government remains committed to ending forced labour, modern slavery, human trafficking and the worst forms of child labour by 2030. We support projects globally to assist survivors, further workers rights and bring about legislative change.\n\nWe will also continue to support activists, campaigners and human rights defenders across the world through direct engagement, work with allies, project funding and trial observation.\n\nPromoting and protecting human rights is a challenging aim. But working together with partners and our international allies we can advance the frontiers of freedom and uphold the human rights of everyone, everywhere.\n\nChapter 1: Democracy\n\nDemocracy and democratic freedoms\n\nDemocracy and freedom are at the heart of the UKs values. They contribute to long-term prosperity and security; and democratic societies are the strongest supporters of an open and resilient international order. However, the global decline in democratic freedom continued in 2021, with autocracies becoming more prevalent and assertive worldwide.\n\nThe UK has responded to these challenges with plans to build a network of partnerships with like-minded partners, together promoting democracy and freedom.\n\nG7 and Summit for Democracy\n\nWith allies and partners, the UK continued to promote democratic freedoms around the world, including through our G7 Presidency and the US Summit for Democracy.\n\nAt the Carbis Bay Summit in June, G7 Leaders, alongside the Republic of Korea, South Africa, India and Australia, signed up to an Open Societies Statement in which they reaffirmed, and encouraged others to embrace, the values that bind us together, including respect for international rules and norms on democracy.\n\nIn December, the UK participated in the US-hosted Summit for Democracy, where the then Prime Minister, then Foreign Secretary and other UK ministers discussed the challenges and opportunities facing democracies with other governments, civil society, and the private sector. The UK announced ambitious commitments, reforms, and initiatives to defend democracy and human rights at home and abroad. These included a strong focus on developing partnerships around trade, security, investment and technology, which will help promote and deepen democratic ties. The UKs Free Trade Agreements will set high standards of openness and accountability with like-minded open economies and seek robust measures to prevent and combat corruption risks.\n\nDigital democracy\n\nThe rapid advance in technology had a positive impact on the ability of people to exercise their democratic rights. However, it also continued to be used as a basis to inhibit democracy through restricting access to the online spaces where people discuss issues, engage with governments and oppositions, challenge decision makers, and exercise their freedoms of expression and association. There were 182 internet shutdowns across 34 countries in 2021.[footnote 1] Through its bilateral and multi stakeholder efforts, the UK worked to push back against digital authoritarianism, and to keep the internet on, open and inclusive.\n\nIn June the Government of Nigeria blocked access to Twitter following a disagreement with the company, including over its editorial policy. The UK and our partners issued a joint statement the same day expressing concern and convened members of the international community to lobby the Nigerian government both publicly and privately to lift the ban. The Nigerian authorities began a series of negotiations via Twitter, with the UK holding private discussions to encourage a resolution.\n\nDuring the UKs G7 Presidency, G7 Leaders affirmed in June their collective opposition to measures which undermined democratic values, such as government-imposed internet shutdowns and network restrictions. The UK will continue to work with partners, including through the Freedom Online Coalition and directly with governments that impose restrictions.\n\nElection observation\n\nElection observation is an integral part of democratic scrutiny and allows the UK to support democracies around the globe. As set out in the Integrated Review, the UK began to develop a new UK capability to support election observation. The first UK thematic election observation mission took place in The Gambia on 4 December, conducted by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. The UK continued to support election observation missions run by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ). In 2021, the UK funded observers to OSCE missions, including in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Albania, Armenia, Moldova and Georgia.\n\nRegional elections took place in Venezuela in November. Observers identified some improvements in electoral conditions and structures, such as the newly appointed board of directors of the National Electoral Council with 2 opposition members, but there were serious shortcomings in the electoral process and evidence of significant electoral irregularities. Prior to the election, the UK provided capacity building for civil society organisations and journalists on conditions for free elections.\n\nCommunity of Democracies\n\nThe UK continued to work with the Community of Democracies (CoD) alongside 27 other states. In his speech to the tenth CoD Ministerial Conference of 22 September, Minister for Human Rights Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon underlined the importance of resilient, inclusive democracies and the UKs commitment to promoting democratic institutions.\n\nTransparency and open government\n\nTransparency of decision making through open and inclusive governance is a hallmark of a functioning democracy. The UK supported the Open Government Partnership (OGP) and the World Bank globally through a 11.2 million programme (2018/19 - 2021/22) designed to deepen open government reform in developing countries. In Nigeria, OGP has enabled the government to introduce legislation on establishing a beneficial ownership registry to prevent the illicit flow of more than US$15.7 billion through Nigeria. In 2021 the UK continued supporting OGP to develop and finalise National Action Plans with member countries, such as Kenya, to advance open justice commitments, developed through a co-creation process and supported by civil society and multiple government agencies.\n\nWestminster Foundation for Democracy\n\nWestminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) is an executive Non-Departmental Public Body dedicated to strengthening democracy overseas. In 2021, WFD continued to work with parliaments, political parties, and civil society in over 30 countries to help make political systems more inclusive and accountable. Amid the pandemic, WFD supported parliaments to monitor and assess COVID-19 emergency legislation, helping to ensure effective oversight as well as more equitable, greener recoveries. In Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, WFD helped parliaments prepare to implement commitments made at COP26.\n\nWFD recruited international election observers for the UK, supporting observation missions in Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Zambia, The Gambia, and Somaliland, among others. WFD also provided tools, knowledge and peer support for parliaments and civil society to advance laws and policies that safeguard democratic freedoms, combat corrupt practices, and make government actions more transparent to citizens. In Sierra Leone and Lebanon, WFD helped develop digital platforms to improve citizen participation in the political process.\n\nWFD worked with political parties around the world to make candidate selection processes more inclusive. In North Macedonia, WFD supported equal participation for people with disabilities (PWDs) through training and organising an election observation by PWDs. WFD produced new research on the importance of womens participation in public life and supported women as community and political leaders across its programme portfolio.\n\nThrough the Global Equality Project, WFD also helped with the enactment of important pieces of legislation including a law to protect people from domestic violence in Nigeria. In Sri Lanka, WFD helped tackle LGBT+ discrimination by conducting a perceptions survey analysing gaps in laws and policies.\n\nWomens political empowerment\n\nWomens political empowerment is critical to, and a key indicator of, a peaceful, prosperous and democratic society. Getting more women into power gives voice to a marginalised section of society, creates female role models and leads to legislative change and policies that tackle gender inequalities and discrimination.\n\nIn peace processes where women are able to exert strong influence, it is much more likely that an agreement will be reached and implemented, and the peace is 35% more likely to last for fifteen years. [footnote 2]\n\nWomen's political leadership on environmental issues: following support and mentoring from the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, women leaders in 3 cantons in Bosnia and Herzegovina got a resolution on indoor air quality adopted. In this photo, MP Amila Hodi discusses the resolution with the media.\n\nIn Yemen, UK funding supported the UN to create a more inclusive political dialogue through non-governmental channels and civil society, particularly the inclusion of marginalised groups, including women.\n\nThrough UK leadership, the G7 reaffirmed its commitment to womens political empowerment and called for the meaningful participation of women and of womens rights organisations in decision-making for COVID-19 recovery. Throughout the year, the UK worked with others in government, the tech industry, academia and civil society to gather insights into the way in which online gendered abuse deters women from engaging in political processes and to explore solutions. In March, the UK hosted a side event at the UN Commission on the Status of Women, which explored better solutions to online violence against women in public life, and in November, the UK co-hosted an event focused on tackling online gendered harms with the Home Office, Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and Wilton Park.\n\nChapter 2: Equality, gender and inclusion\n\nGender equality\n\nWomens and girls rights\n\nIn November, the then Foreign Secretary committed to putting women and girls at the centre of UK foreign and development policy. The UK is alarmed by the increased challenges to the hard-won rights for women and girls. In negotiations at the UN and in other multilateral fora, the UK worked tirelessly to protect and promote womens and girls rights, especially sexual and reproductive health and rights.\n\nRita French, the UKs International Ambassador for Human Rights, in Nairobi in November 2021 with Kenyas Deputy Minister for ICT, Innovation and Youth, Nadia Ahmed Abdalla, learning how to make sanitary products to supply to young girls in impoverished communities.\n\nEducating girls\n\nThe UK remained steadfast in its commitment to stand up for the right of every girl to have 12 years of quality education. This includes ensuring the most marginalised girls can catch up on lost learning due to COVID-19 and are equipped with basic skills.\n\nThe school closures caused by COVID-19 exacerbated existing inequalities, especially where there was no quality alternative learning offer available to all. Combined with the shutdown of public life in 2021, this contributed to a lack of safe spaces.\n\nHowever, the costs were highest for already disadvantaged groups including poor students and adolescent girls in particular.[footnote 3] Secondary age girls were most at risk of staying home or marrying early because their families fell into poverty. Emerging data on dropouts show the real impact of school closures on childrens school participation. [footnote 4] For example, a survey in Kenya found that twice as many girls (16%) failed to return to school in January 2021 compared to boys (8%) and adolescent girls noted that school closures disrupted their access to menstrual products. [footnote 5] In 2021, the UK continued work to support mothers and girls who are pregnant to return to school, including lobbying for, and supporting, the development of policies that reduce the barriers to education that these girls face.\n\nThe UKs flagship Girls Education Challenge continued to run in 2021. It is the worlds largest programme dedicated to girls education, supporting up to 1.52 million marginalised girls with access to education across 17 countries. In 2021 the programme continued to help these girls to learn and improve their literacy and numeracy skills, complete primary school and transition to secondary education or training.\n\nUnder the UKs G7 Presidency in 2021, the UK agreed 2 ambitious global targets of getting 40 million more girls in education, and 20 million more girls reading by age 10, by 2026. In May 2021, the then Prime Minister launched the Girls Education Action Plan, setting out the practical steps the UK will take to deliver our global targets.\n\nIn July, the UK co-led a United Nations Human Rights Council ( HRC ) resolution on girls education with the UAE, which was adopted by consensus and gained 97 co-sponsors. The UK was also proud to co-sponsor the UN Security Council ( UNSC ) resolution 2601 on the Protection of Education in Armed Conflict, reaffirming that the right to education makes a fundamental contribution to building peace and security.\n\nAlso in July, the UK co-hosted the Global Education Summit with Kenya raising an unprecedented US $4 billion (2.9 billion) for the Global Partnership for Education. At COP26, the UK showcased girls education as an essential tool for responding to the climate crisis. The UKs bilateral country programmes adapted to ensure children are safe and can continue to learn. UK humanitarian funds helped provide safe spaces for learning for 38,000 displaced children, including 28,000 girls. In Afghanistan, the UK called for girls secondary education to be restored.\n\nHelen Grant MP, the Prime Ministers Special Envoy on Girls Education, meeting with pupils in Sunamganj, Bangladesh, at their local UNICEF learning centre in November 2021. FCDO funding is helping schools like this in Bangladeshs most remote areas to scale-up so the UK can support even more girls to have 12 years of quality education.\n\nWomen, Peace and Security ( WPS )\n\nIn 2021, in line with the objectives in the UKs WPS National Action Plan ( NAP ) from 2018 to 2022, the UK continued to focus on promoting womens full, equal and meaningful participation in peace processes, increasing support and protection for women resolving conflict and building peace at the grassroots.\n\nIn February, the UK published 3 guidance notes on peacekeeping, gender-based violence and humanitarian response, to support UK government implementation of the NAP s strategic outcomes.\n\nIn Libya, the UK supported civil society and women rights organisations to address the needs of women and girls and support local communities to overcome the challenges of COVID-19 and conflict. UK funding delivered community-based activities, ranging from outreach campaigns to livelihoods and business skills to psychosocial support.\n\nIn Vietnam, the UK supported the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Institute for Peace and Reconciliation to develop their training module on WPS . The UK shared its experience of implementing National Action Plans as part of the first phase in the development of Vietnams first NAP on WPS .\n\nThe UK continued to build Somalias police and military capability to better include, serve, and protect women, including through building capacity within the Somali Ministry of Defence and Somali National Army to deliver training on gender.\n\nIn 2021, the UK helped increase womens leadership and presence in security through providing 1.2 million to the Elsie Initiative Fund for women in peace operations and through pre-deployment training delivered to peacekeepers through the British Peace Support Team (Africa). Through our funding and diplomatic support to the Women Mediators across the Commonwealth Network, members provided technical expertise to various peace dialogues, including in South Sudan, Cyprus and Myanmar.\n\nThe UK helped to secure stronger WPS language in UN Security Council products with WPS referenced in 63% of all UN Security Council Resolutions. The UK also led efforts to address a global rise in reprisals against women Human Rights Defenders ( HRDs ) and peacebuilders, supporting the development of UN guidance and providing emergency grants to those facing intimidation or reprisal in conflict settings.\n\nGender and climate change\n\nClimate change can exacerbate gender and other social inequalities and can undermine the enjoyment of human rights. Women, girls and marginalised people are disproportionately impacted by climate change. While women and girls are critical agents of change within the response, they are often excluded from decision-making. [footnote 6] The UK is committed to advancing gender equality and social inclusion within climate action, including by championing womens and girls climate leadership and empowerment within the green economy, while building their resilience to climate impacts.\n\nThe UK prioritised taking an inclusive approach to our COP26 Presidency, including by driving implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Gender Action Plan agreed at COP25. The UK hosted a Presidency theme day on gender at COP26 in November, announcing 165 million UK funding to tackle gender inequality and climate change hand-in-hand, and welcoming new commitments on gender and climate from multiple countries and non-state actors. The UK also integrated gender equality into events across the COP26 fortnight, successfully demonstrating that gender equality is not an isolated issue but fundamental to many of the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change.\n\nAt COP26, Parties agreed building blocks for a review of the Gender Action Plan scheduled for COP27. This review will strengthen the implementation of the Gender Action Plan. The Glasgow Climate Pact also encourages Parties to increase the full, meaningful and equal participation of women in climate action and to ensure gender-responsive implementation.\n\nIn June 2021, the UK joined the Generation Equality Action Coalition on Feminist Action for Climate Justice and made commitments on gender and climate finance, women and girls climate resilience and leadership, and data on the gender-climate nexus. [footnote 7]\n\nWomens economic empowerment\n\nWomen and girls are at the heart of the UKs approach to economic development. The UK has increased investment and continued to help women access the benefits of trade globally.\n\nIn 2021, our 19 million Gender-Responsive Social Protection programme developed guidance to support the most marginalised women and girls in informal employment. The Land Investment for Transformation programme supported the Government of Ethiopia to implement legislation giving women equal land registration rights with men and helped reduce the gap in labour force participation.\n\nIn July 2021, the UKs Development Finance Institution, CDC Group, co-led the creation of the 2X Collaborative, a new global industry body that promotes gender lens investing. Under the UKs Presidency, G7 Ministers and 2X partners set an ambition to invest $15 billion in development finance from 2021 to 2022 to help women in developing countries access jobs, build resilient businesses and respond to the devastating economic impacts of COVID-19.\n\nIn 2021, the SheTrades Commonwealth programme rolled out SheTrades Outlook to 32 developing countries and helped governments to collect data and share best practice on trade policy that affects women entrepreneurs and their business.\n\nThe then Foreign Secretary meets with the UK All-Party Parliamentary Group for Trade Out of Poverty in March 2021, to set out how the UK is tackling the barriers women face in trade and how it is prioritising womens economic empowerment in our Financial Trade Agreements.\n\nEnding violence against women and girls\n\nViolence against women and girls ( VAWG ) continues to be one of the most systemic and widespread human rights abuses of our time, with 1 in 3 women worldwide experiencing physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime, as well as high rates of child marriage and Female Genital Mutilation ( FGM ).[footnote 8] COVID-19 has exacerbated the drivers of VAWG , including long-term school closures which increase childrens vulnerability to violence, exploitation and the risk of child marriage. [footnote 9]\n\nIn South Sudan, the UK continued its 6-year 25 million programme with the International Medical Corps to provide support to GBV survivors. The UK also funded 2,154 instances of GBV care through the Health-Pooled Fund between April and December 2021. In Syria, UK funding helped provide dedicated GBV case management to 17,498 women and supply over 70,000 dignity kits to vulnerable Syrians.\n\nThe elimination of all forms of VAWG so that women and girls can live freely and without fear is a priority for the FCDO . In November, the Foreign Secretary stepped up the UKs global leadership on ending violence against women and girls, announcing a package of over 22 million new funding to end child marriage, support survivors, and fund womens rights organisations. In November, Minister Ford launched the 67.5 million What Works to Prevent Violence: Impact at Scale programme, which is the first global effort to scale-up proven violence prevention approaches worldwide.\n\nThrough the UKs co-leadership of the Generation Equality Action Coalition on Gender-Based Violence, which was launched in June 2021, the UK helped to raise the importance of funding womens rights organisations to end violence.\n\nPreventing sexual violence in conflict\n\nThe scale of sexual violence in conflict globally is appalling. In November, the then Foreign Secretary confirmed that the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative ( PSVI ) would be one of her top priorities. The Prime Ministers Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict, Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon, led UK efforts to tackle conflict-related sexual violence ( CRSV ). The PSVI focused on 3 objectives: strengthening the global response; strengthening pathways to justice and tackling impunity; and enhancing support for all survivors and children born of sexual violence in conflict.\n\nIn June, a member of the PSVI Team of Experts was deployed to Ethiopia to address justice for sexual violence crimes. The UK worked with partners to implement the experts recommendations.\n\nIn Iraq, there was progress on legislation to provide reparations for survivors of Daesh crimes. In March 2021, the Iraqi Parliament passed the Yazidi Survivors Law, which formally recognised Daesh atrocities as genocide and crimes against humanity and established a reparations framework for female survivors of CRSV . The UK is one of the first donors to contribute to implementation efforts and worked with the government and partners to press for full financial provision of the law. The UK also supported the provision of psychosocial support services for female survivors of CRSV .\n\nThe UK secured agreement from NATO Leaders to endorse NATOs first policy on CRSV . In November, the UK launched the Call to Action to Ensure the Rights and Wellbeing of Children Born of Sexual Violence in Conflict. In the same month, the then Foreign Secretary also announced a 1.4 million contribution to the Global Survivors Fund.\n\nIn November 2021 Lord Tariq Ahmad launched a Call to Action asking countries to speak out about the challenges faced by children born of sexual violence in conflict and commit to action to change the laws, policies and practices that prevent them from realising their rights and living life to the fullest.\n\nThroughout 2021, the UK funded consultations on the Murad Code, the global code of conduct for collecting information from survivors. The UK also funded community dialogues on the principles of the Declaration of Humanity in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to tackle survivor stigmatisation.\n\nAs a global leader in tackling CRSV , the UK called for a stronger international response. The then Foreign Secretary announced her intention to strengthen international consensus on tackling CRSV and to host an international conference in November 2022, marking 10 years since PSVI s launch and driving forward global action on this issue. The UK works closely with its PSVI Survivor Champions to help ensure a survivor-centred approach.\n\nSexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment\n\nThe UK remained committed to tackling sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment ( SEAH ). The FCDO published its annual progress report in December 2021 against the 22 donor commitments from the 2018 Safeguarding Summit, [footnote 10] and continued to convene stakeholders from across the aid sector, including to support progress against Summit commitments and to produce an annual sector-wide progress update. [footnote 11]\n\nThe UK embedded tackling SEAH into FCDO s policies and procedures, reported back on the progress made in implementing the 2020 UK SEAH aid sector Safeguarding Strategy and continued to drive change. [footnote 12]\n\nThe UK announced a new 5 million programme to support victims and survivors, with projects in the DRC , Liberia and Haiti, making the UK the largest donor to the UN Trust Fund to support victims of SEAH . The UK also funded the UN s Sexual Harassment Taskforce in Geneva. The UK continued to drive change to improve both prevention and response to SEAH through our Safeguarding Innovation and Engagement Fund, Project Soteria and the Resource and Support Hub.\n\nThe FCDO demonstrated global leadership, including by supporting the UN Secretary Generals zero tolerance approach to SEA and ensuring that all mandates for Peacekeeping Missions contained language on the protection of women and children from SEA and on accountability measures. The UK shared best practices with the UN and member states, including on the impact of the UKs Domestic Abuse Act 2021 extending extra-territorial jurisdiction for certain sexual offences committed by UK nationals abroad. The British Peace Support Team (Africa) provided training to support capability development to over 10,000 personnel from African Troop and Police Contributing Countries deploying to UN and African Union Peace Operations. All our British Peace Support Team (Africa) courses had a module on SEAH .\n\nFemale genital mutilation ( FGM )\n\nFGM is one of the most extreme manifestations of gender inequality. It is a human rights violation that can result in a lifetime of physical, psychological and emotional suffering. In 2021, the UK demonstrated its continued commitment to this agenda and continued delivering the second phase of our support for the Africa-Led Movement to End FGM a multi-year, multi-country UK aid package working with activists, communities and harnessing evidence-based solutions to scale up efforts to end FGM . [footnote 13]\n\nIn 2021, through the Africa-Led Movement to End FGM , engagement with communities in Kenya has provided a safe space and platform for them to speak about FGM and rights violations, an important step towards changing behaviours on FGM at local level.\n\nUK support to the UN Joint Programme for ending FGM helped support Mauritania and Senegal develop and implement costed national plans to end the harmful practice. Through programme work in Sudan, the UK also continued to support the Sudanese-led movement to eradicate FGM , building on longstanding efforts to change social norms, support an improved legal environment, and strengthen systems combatting FGM .\n\nThe then FCDO Minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, meets Mama Iqbal, a community leader who successfully campaigned to make her 200,000-strong community of Tuti island free from FGM.\n\nThe UKs International Ambassador for Human Rights, Rita French and Director for UNFPA, Monica Ferro, receiving a Maasai welcome when meeting community members in the Kajiado county of Kenya in November 2021, to learn how they are ending the practice of FGM.\n\nRights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people\n\nThe UK is fully committed to promoting and protecting the rights and dignity of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT+) people. The UK condemns any discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic continued to impact on key opportunities to advance the human rights of LGBT+ people. There were signs of countries backsliding and becoming increasingly unsafe for LGBT+ people. A growing number of countries are using divisive issues to undermine social attitudes towards LGBT+ and restrict their human rights through the introduction of discriminatory legislation. These vocal debates detrimentally affect broader human rights and equalities issues, including the rights of women and girls.\n\nIn 2021 the UK and Argentina continued to co-chair the Equal Rights Coalition (ERC), a grouping of 42 most like-minded countries, partnering with civil society and international organisations to address violence and discrimination against LGBT+ individuals around the world, and the continuing criminalisation of same-sex conduct in almost 70 countries. The UK is committed to strengthening the work and impact of the ERC and in July 2021 launched the ERCs first Strategy and 5-Year Implementation plan at a 2-day virtual conference, with a follow up virtual meeting in January 2022 to assess progress. The pandemic had delayed delivery of the Strategy, which had 2 rounds of broad consultation with ERC stakeholders.\n\nIn May 2021, the Prime Minister appointed Lord Herbert as Special Envoy on LGBT+ rights, to continue to drive UKs global leadership on LGBT+ rights. The Special Envoy worked closely with our diplomatic network as they continued to monitor and raise human rights issues, including in response to incidents of human rights violations against LGBT+ people or activists. This includes marking important occasions, such as the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT) and by participating in physical Pride marches and hosting virtual events to raise awareness of the challenges LGBT+ people face.\n\nIn many parts of the world, LGBT+ people continue to face challenges that limit their visibility, representation and meaningful participation in society. The UKs diplomatic network therefore continued to fly the rainbow flag, including for the first time in Barbados, Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates, as a symbol of solidarity and a visible demonstration of our commitment to human rights and equality for all LGBT+ people. We also flew the flag in celebration of progress on LGBT+ equality, such as the opening of marriage to same-sex couples in Switzerland and Chile.\n\nOverseas Territories Each Overseas Territory has its own constitution, government and local laws. The UK Government continued to expect the territories to abide by the same basic standards of human rights as the UK. The UK continued to encourage the territories to seek the extension of the core UN human rights conventions ratified by the UK when they were ready to apply them. The UK Government is committed to equal rights, including upholding the rights of LGBT+ people. At the end of 2021, 10 Overseas Territories had legal recognition and protection for same-sex relationships. Same-sex marriage is legal in the British Indian Ocean Territory, British Antarctic Territory, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Pitcairn Islands, St Helena, Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha, and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia for UK military and civilian personnel. Marriage law is an area of devolved responsibility in Overseas Territories and is for the territories to decide and legislate on. However, the UK will continue to encourage all the Overseas Territories to ensure enjoyment of human rights by all their citizens, and to ensure that all legislation is compliant with human rights obligations.\n\nIn October the UK hosted a virtual meeting of ERC member states to co-ordinate responses to violations against LGBT+ people in Afghanistan. The UK was the first country to offer a bespoke route for the relocation of vulnerable LGBT+ Afghans and working closely with civil society organisations such as Stonewall, Rainbow Railroad and Micro Rainbow, welcomed the first of several groups to the UK in October 2021. This represents just part of the UKs effort to get vulnerable Afghans to safety through the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy and the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme.\n\nIn 2021, the UK committed over 2.7 million to support projects focused on LGBT+ rights around the world. This funding provided of capacity building for grassroots HRDs and enabled legal technical assistance to governments and civil society organisations seeking to overturn discriminatory laws and policies in the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office lit up in rainbow colours in July 2021 to mark the 30th Anniversary of the UK Government lifting the ban on LGBT+ people serving openly in the diplomatic service, and to highlight our commitment to advancing LGBT+ equality and human rights internally and around the world.\n\nRights of people with disabilities\n\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continued to disproportionately impact people with disabilities around the world and reversed many of the hard-won gains to secure their human rights, as set out in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The FCDO committed to launching a refreshed strategy on disability inclusion and rights to reflect its new departmental mandate and rising global challenges, including recovering from the pandemic. The UK stepped down from co-chairing the Global Action on Disability (GLAD) Network at the end of our term but continued to play a key role, co-chairing the Inclusive Health Working Group.\n\nDuring 2021, the FCDO continued to deliver results on disability inclusion. For example, the FCDO Disability Inclusive Development programme supported approximately 2.9 million people with disabilities across several areas such as education, health and jobs. This included providing 3,600 people with disabilities with better access to healthcare in Nigeria, Bangladesh, and Kenya. In Somalia, the UKs Adolescent Girls Education project assisted 927 girls with disabilities to attend school.\n\nOver the year, organisations of persons with disabilities, funded by the FCDO Disability Capacity Building programme, secured more than 50 legal reforms and programme changes across 11 countries to ensure people with disabilities receive improved rights. Partners trained over 300 new disability activists in how to advocate for disability rights and supported 5 alternative reports to human rights reporting mechanisms. Through the Global Disability Innovation Hub, the UK supported the development of 3D-printing of assistive devices for people that support weak or damaged bones, joints, and muscles in Uganda. The project also developed partnerships with local hospitals to utilise the technology developed.\n\nRights of the child\n\nEvery year it is estimated that more than 1 billion children experience violence, exploitation and abuse, [footnote 14] with long lasting impacts. The UK Government is firmly committed to the promotion, protection and realisation of childrens rights.\n\nIn 2021, the FCDO led cross-Governmental efforts to help secure the adoption by consensus of a number of childs rights resolutions at the UN General Assembly and the HRC , in line with UK priorities. This included UN Security Council Resolution 2601(2021) on the Protection of Education in Armed Conflict.\n\nThe UK continued to actively participate in the UNSC Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, which responds to the UN Secretary Generals annual report on Children and Armed Conflict, negotiating and issuing recommendations to priority countries. The UK provided 250,000 to UNICEFs Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism for financial year 2021-2022 for its core activities in providing accurate information on grave child rights violations to the UNSC .\n\nIn 2021, the UK was the largest donor to Education Cannot Wait - the global fund for education in emergencies - with a 20% burden share, having pledged 90 million from 2019 until 2023. The UK continued to be a strong advocate of the Safe Schools Declaration, a commitment to protect students from the worst effects of armed conflict, and the UK ensures the Declaration is gender responsive by situating it within our Girls Education campaign.\n\nThe UK remained steadfast in our commitment to protect vulnerable children through our policy leadership and programmatic work. The UK is one of the founding Board members of the Global Partnership to End Violence (EVAC), and the UK provided 10 million between 2017 and 2021, including 5 million for the Safe to Learn campaign to accelerate action at local, national and international levels towards ending all violence in schools by 2024. [footnote 15]\n\nThe FCDO has continued to provide support to the Overseas Territories (OTs) throughout the year, including funded expertise, to assist them in strengthening their child safeguarding systems. This has included partnering with UNICEF on a Positive Behaviour Management Programme in 4 Overseas Territories;[footnote 16] and the establishment of Practice Partnerships with UK Local Authorities and a number of Territories, enabling the development of professional peer relationships, the sharing of good practice and training, and the provision of expertise.\n\nIn November 2021, Leaders of the Overseas Territories (OTs) acknowledged the importance of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and committed to continue to promote and protect childrens rights as set out in the Convention, and to review the outstanding reservations. In response to the specific challenges of protecting children from the effects of armed conflict, the UK continued to apply diplomatic pressure in the UNSC Working Group on Children in Armed Conflict (CAAC), responding to the UN Secretary-Generals annual report published in June 2021 and CAAC country-specific reports, which assess the treatment of children within conflict zones and lists governments and armed groups for committing grave violations against children. In October 2021 the UK co-sponsored the UNSC Resolution 2601 on the Protection of Education in Armed Conflict.\n\nRights of older people\n\nThe UK takes a life course approach, aiming to protect the rights of all individuals at all stages of their lives. The UK recognises the diverse experiences, priorities, and requirements of older people, many of whom have disabilities, which can impact their autonomy, dignity and participation in society.\n\nCOVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on older people - directly and indirectly and across all areas of life. Older people remained at a significantly higher risk of contracting COVID-19, developing severe complications and dying. [footnote 17] The pandemic has exposed the inequalities and age discrimination many older people face and exacerbated the barriers, exclusion and isolation they already experienced.\n\nIn 2021, the UK worked with international partners to push for co-ordinated, inclusive COVID-19 responses, including by providing specialist advice to governments on the inclusion of older persons and marginalised groups in social protection responses to COVID-19 via an expert advice helpline, and by requiring all humanitarian partners to follow minimum standards and explain how their responses were inclusive of vulnerable groups. In 2021, the UK worked with the Open-Ended Working Group on Ageing, [footnote 18] and supported the human rights of older people and widows through resolutions and statements at the HRC , [footnote 19] the UN General Assembly, [footnote 20] and elsewhere. The UK remained open to the principle of a multilateral instrument dedicated to the human rights of older people.\n\nAs a key stakeholder in the Titchfield City Group on ageing, the FCDO continued to invest in improving the collection, analysis and use of disaggregated data. [footnote 21] The UK continued to support assistive technology, recognising its critical role for inclusion, its transformative impact for older people, and as a key enabler for change. [footnote 22]\n\nChapter 3: Human rights priority themes\n\nFreedom of religion or belief\n\nPromotion of the right to freedom of religion or belief ( FoRB ) remained a key human rights priority for the UK in 2021. The Minister for Human Rights, Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon continued to lead FoRB work, in collaboration with the Prime Ministers Special Envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief, Fiona Bruce MP. The then Prime Minister appointed David Burrowes as Deputy Special Envoy for FoRB , to support the Special Envoy in promoting FoRB . [footnote 23]\n\nIn China, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Falun Gong practitioners and others remained at risk of persecution. In particular, systematic restrictions on the practice of Islam in Xinjiang persisted. The UK imposed asset freezes and travel bans on Chinese government officials and one entity responsible for human rights violations in the region. UK efforts helped secure the support of over 40 countries for statements on Xinjiang and Tibet at the UN in June and October. [footnote 24]\n\nIn Afghanistan, religious minorities continued to face persecution and threats, including by the Taliban themselves. The minority ethnic Hazara group (predominantly Shia Muslims) faced attacks and forced evictions, displacing communities and leaving people homeless. Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) attacks increased, frequently targeting Shia Muslim communities.\n\nIn India, our High Commission engaged with religious representatives and faith communities. The UK supported a UK-India Interfaith Leadership Programme for emerging Indian leaders of diverse faith backgrounds, creating an exchange of UK-India expertise on leading modern, inclusive faith communities, and promoting values of tolerance and multi-culturalism.\n\nIn North East Nigeria, terrorist groups including Islamic State West Africa and Boko Haram continued to indiscriminately attack those of all faiths who do not subscribe to their ideology. In addition, the UK remains concerned about intercommunal conflicts and criminal banditry in the North West and Middle Belt states. Religious identity can be a factor in this violence, but the UK continues to assess that competition over resources, historical grievances and criminality are key drivers. The UK continued its work to address the underlying causes of this violence in Nigeria.\n\nIn Iran, Christians, especially converts, suffered discrimination and violence while systemic persecution of Bahais increased. At the UN Human Rights Council ( HRC ) session in March, the UK highlighted to Iran that such persistent human rights violations were unacceptable.\n\nIn Pakistan, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Shia Muslims, Christians, Hindus, and Sikhs experienced violence and discrimination, including from denial of political participation, targeted killings, and damage to places of worship and desecration of graves. Forced conversion and forced marriage continued. Ahmadis additionally continue to be denied political participation unless they give up the right to call themselves Muslim. The UK funded programmes to promote the rights of the most vulnerable members of Pakistani society and raised concerns with Pakistan. In December, the UK imposed sanctions on a terrorist commander for orchestrating the 2017 bombing of a Sufi shrine.\n\nThe lack of freedom of religion or belief in the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea continued to see Christians and other faith groups worshipping in secret for fear of being caught and persecuted. The UK worked with partners to secure strong UN resolutions on DPRK , with emphasis on the right to FoRB .\n\nIn March, the UK made a statement at the OSCE about the persecution of Jehovahs Witnesses in Russia. [footnote 25]. The UK continues to call on Russia to uphold its commitments on the right to FoRB for all.\n\nThe military coup in Sudan put many of the gains on human rights made since the 2019 revolution at risk. In the House of Commons on 25 October, FCDO Minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, called for the Sudanese people to be able to protest and pray without fear of violence. [footnote 26]\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the marginalisation of Muslim communities continued despite the ban on mandatory cremations for those deceased due to COVID-19 being lifted. The states promotion of Buddhism led to increased land disputes in areas of cultural significance for other faiths. The UK called for the rights of people from all faiths to be respected, including through a UK-led resolution on Sri-Lanka at the HRC .\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, open practice of non-Muslim faiths remained prohibited. However, the Saudi authorities have employed more inclusive language towards other faiths. In June, the British Embassy in Riyadh hosted an Interfaith Dialogue. The aim of this event was to foster trust and respect between different faiths and to understand concerns of non-Muslim groups.\n\nEngagement with international partners remained central to the UKs work. In March, Lord Tariq Ahmad hosted a meeting at the UN Security Council ( UNSC ) on the persecution of religious minorities in conflict zones, and in June the Special Envoy spoke on emerging challenges to FoRB on a panel in the margins of the HRC . The UK used our G7 Presidency to secure language on FoRB in the G7 communique, laying the foundations for further collaboration within this group.\n\nLord Tariq Ahmad chairing a UNSC meeting in March 2021 where Justin Welby, Karim Khan KC, Religions for Peace and others shared insights on religions role in peace-making.\n\nThe UK was an active member of the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance (The Alliance) and in December, the Special Envoy was elected as Chair of the Alliance for 2022. In November, the then Foreign Secretary addressed the Alliance Ministers Forum and agreed a joint statement.[footnote 27] The UK joined Alliance statements, including on repression of Jehovahs Witnesses, on standing in solidarity with victims of attacks by the Myanmar security forces, and on the need to respect the rights of members of religious minorities in Afghanistan.\n\nLord Tariq Ahmad and the Special Envoy participated in events with civil society and parliamentary stakeholders throughout the year. This included the UK FoRB Forum, chaired by the Bishop of Truro and his successor, Mervyn Thomas, an event on the UN Day to Commemorate Victims of Violence based on FoRB and the All-Party Parliamentary Humanists Group Annual General Meeting. In May, the Special Envoy made a virtual visit to the Holy See, where Foreign Minister Archbishop Gallagher expressed support for UK efforts on FoRB . In July, Lord Tariq Ahmad and the FoRB Special Envoy launched training on Religion for International Engagement.\n\nThe John Bunyan Fund supported research by the Coalition for Religious Equality and Inclusive Development into intersecting vulnerabilities experienced by religious minorities living in poverty in the shadow of COVID-19.\n\nThe UK marked a number of international days in 2021. In November, the FCDO UK estate was lit up in red to mark Red Wednesday, highlighting the persecution of Christians around the world.\n\nWork continued towards the 2022 UK-hosted international Ministerial Conference on FoRB .\n\nThe Prime Ministers Special Envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief, Fiona Bruce MP, with FoRB campaigners in December 2021.

This ensures that the UK can effectively counter Holocaust denial which has at its heart the recasting of history. The UK also remains committed to addressing Holocaust distortion, a more mainstream but equally pernicious activity.\n\nThe Rt Hon Lord Pickles continued to serve as the UKs Special Envoy for post-Holocaust issues, ensuring the UK played a leading role in a number of international bodies related to remembering the Holocaust and addressing antisemitism.\n\nLord Pickles also continued to head the UK delegation to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). In January, the FCDO and the Israeli Embassy hosted an online event to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day. The then Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, Lord Pickles and the Israeli Ambassador to the UK delivered remarks for the event which centred around a first-hand account from a Holocaust survivor. It was confirmed in June that the UK will chair IHRA in 2024, as part of our continued international leadership in combatting antisemitism.\n\nOn 6 October, Lord Tariq Ahmad represented the UK at the 80th anniversary commemorating the Babyn Yar massacre, the largest massacre of Jews in the Holocaust to that date in 1941. The event was hosted by Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and attendees included the Presidents of Germany and Israel. Lord Tariq Ahmad met civil society and religious representatives, including the Chief Rabbi of Kyiv and Ukraine.\n\nLord Pickles led the UK delegation to the Malm International Forum on Holocaust Remembrance and Combatting Antisemitism on 13 October, marking 20 years since the signing of the Stockholm Declaration. The then Foreign Secretary announced a number of UK pledges, including the construction and opening of the new Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre in London by 2025, improving teacher training to cover the Holocaust and address antisemitism better, and the Online Safety Bill to tackle harmful abuse online.\n\nThe UK continued to support the work of the Wiener Holocaust Library, the worlds oldest institution devoted to the study of the Holocaust. The Wiener Library is the UK home to the digital copy of the International Tracing Service (ITS) which is a key resource to research the fate of victims of the Holocaust.\n\nMedia freedom\n\nThe UK remains committed to championing media freedom around the globe, both bilaterally and through international fora. In 2021 the UK continued our work on key initiatives, ranging from the Media Freedom Coalition to the Global Media Defence Fund and development programming. The UK worked with media organisations and civil society throughout all with the aim of making the world a safer place for journalists and supporting resilient and financially sustainable models for independent journalism.\n\nThe UK used its G7 Presidency to highlight the importance of media freedom and was successful is securing strong commitments to champion this agenda, including through the Media Freedom Coalition, and continued to lead by example domestically. Partners agreed to use their diplomatic missions to coordinate locally, supporting journalists and independent media under threat.\n\nThe UK also participated in a number of media freedom events during 2021. The UK supported the World Press Freedom Day Conference by organising a side event on The role of governments in protecting Media Freedom: What more can the Media Freedom Coalition do? The then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab recorded a message, in which he discussed the impact of COVID-19 and the increased financial challenges that threaten media freedom.\n\nLord Tariq Ahmad co-hosted, with the High Commissioner for Namibia, a meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Mission in London, highlighting the importance of media freedom in the Commonwealth. In Turkey, where civil society continued to face pressure, the UK supported a variety of media freedom initiatives and civil society groups, including by hosting them at the Embassy in Ankara for panel discussions and through observing the trials of journalists.\n\nWhen it came to legal reform, in Ecuador, the Embassy worked closely with the incoming government before it assumed power in June 2021. On his first day in office, the new president repealed an old communication law and announced plans for a new law, encompassing media freedom. In Montenegro, the British Embassy funded a project which aims to improve the existing legislative and policy framework and prescribe tangible mechanisms which will defend media freedoms and the safety of journalists.\n\nJournalists play a critical role to maintaining media freedom. The UK worked with Indias vibrant media, including through support for the Thomson Reuters Foundation to train over 20 journalists to report about issues such as human trafficking and child labour.\n\nIn Malta, the long-awaited public inquiry into the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia concluded in July 2021. The report made a series of recommendations aimed at strengthening the rule of law and media freedom. The Government of Malta has committed to meeting the recommendations and the UK High Commissioner held regular meetings with a range of actors supporting change.\n\nLord Tariq Ahmad meeting with media outlets from Bosnia and Herzegovina who participated in the UK-funded Media for All programme for the Western Balkans, in Sarajevo in November 2021.\n\nMedia Freedom Coalition\n\nMembership of the Media Freedom Coalition grew to 50 in 2021 with the additions of the Chile, Croatia, Guyana, Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, the Republic of Korea and Sierra Leone. Coalition members commit to raise media freedom at home and abroad, share best practice, and lobby on cases.\n\nAs the UK handed over the role of co-chair of the Media Freedom Coalition to The Netherlands, it has taken steps to create a secretariat to offer ongoing administrative support to the Coalition, helping member states focus more on action on the ground.\n\nThe UK also worked with partners to establish a working group of the Media Freedom Coalition to improve the coordination and effectiveness of Coalition members support to the media sector.\n\nThe Coalition issued statements to mark key dates such as World Press Freedom Day, the anniversary of the London global conference and the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists. The Coalition also issuing statements highlighting situations of concern.\n\nLord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon, Minister for Human Rights, meeting with the New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK, Bede Corry, in July 2021 as New Zealand signed the Global Pledge on Media Freedom.\n\nCivic and media spaces in Afghanistan diminished. While the Afghan media remained largely free and independent until August, there were targeted killings of journalists, civil society activists and HRDs , largely attributed to the Taliban. In response, the UK and Canada, as co-chairs of the Media Freedom Coalition, released a joint statement condemning the violence in late January. The UK also offered resettlement to over 70 journalists and other employees of UK media organisations during Operation Pitting/during the evacuation.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating media freedom situation in China, including the sentencing of citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, the UK and other members of the Media Freedom Coalition issued a joint statement on 20 January 2021 that highlighted our deep concerns about the ongoing efforts by the Chinese authorities to curtail media freedom, and called on China to allow all journalists to practise their profession without fear of arrest, harassment or reprisal.\n\nHigh Level Panel of Legal Experts\n\nThe High Level Panel of Legal Experts is an independent advisory panel of 15 distinguished lawyers, focused on improving legal protections for journalists and for a free and independent media. The UK promoted the work of the Panel amongst the Media Freedom Coalition, facilitating meetings in 2021 to showcase its most recent reports and work.\n\nGlobal Media Defence Fund\n\nThe UK continued to support the UNESCO administered fund, aimed at ensuring effective legal assistance and support to civil society and journalists. The UK donated 600,000 in 2021 as part of a 5-year commitment to the Fund. In Spring 2021, UNESCO ran its second call for proposals, which has resulted in 42 projects being selected which will support a further 1,500 journalists worldwide, bringing the total number of journalists supported by the Fund to over 3,000 to date.\n\nProtecting Independent Media for Effective Development\n\nThe UKs Protecting Independent Media for Effective Development (PRIMED) programme has brought together several world-leading media development organisations in a consortium led by BBC Media Action. Since its launch in 2019, this 4-year programme has been working in depth with 13 public interest media organisations in Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone. PRIMED support is helping these organisations to survive and thrive during difficult economic times. It has also worked with editors, regulators and CSOs to develop a better environment for media in those 3 countries for example by supporting a nationwide consultation on a new Code of Practice for Media in Sierra Leone, which launched in December. PRIMED also published a Coalitions for Change learning brief in November, which set out the challenges and success factors for building coalitions to support media freedom.\n\nIn addition to PRIMED, the FCDO continued to support 2 other major programmes supporting freedom of expression and media development. The Protecting Rights, Openness and Transparency Enhancing Civic Transformation programme (PROTECT) supports media organisations to improve their sustainability in Kenya and has provided emergency support to journalists under threat in Myanmar. The Aswat Horra (Free Voices) programme helped to build the capacity of 11 civil society organisations to campaign more effectively for freedom of expression in Lebanon and Libya.\n\nCivil society and civic freedoms\n\nThe UKs support for civic freedoms is strongly linked to our values. Civic freedoms help promote accountability, expose corruption and bring about positive change. Vibrant and diverse civic spaces, in which people can access and enjoy their rights to the freedoms of peaceful assembly, association, and expression, are crucial for good governance and a healthy democracy. By providing valuable expertise from an independent viewpoint, civil society can inform better policy and act as a pressure valve to transform the increasing dissent we have witnessed in 2021 into constructive public debate. Sadly, many governments are choosing to characterise the enjoyment of civil rights as a threat and as a result civic space is becoming more contested, with civic freedoms increasingly restricted in many parts of the world.\n\nThe UK Government, as part of its commitment to civic freedoms, stood alongside civil society against these encroachments. The UK also supported the extraordinary bravery of HRDs and people who work for civil society organisations (CSOs), often at serious personal risk, in some of the worlds most dangerous places.\n\nRestrictions to civic space\n\n2021 proved to be another challenging year for civic space, with the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to be used by some governments as cover for imposing unwarranted restrictions to civic space that will remain long after the pandemic has receded. According to the findings of the CIVICUS Monitor, the number of people living in countries with significant restrictions to civic space amounted to almost 89% of the global population in 2021. [footnote 28]\n\nThe tools used to restrict or control civic space included disproportionate responses to peaceful protest and dissent, such as the excessive use of force, measures restricting freedom of expression (e.g. censorship, internet shutdowns, surveillance and attacks on journalists, HRDs and academics), the misuse of terrorism laws and counter-terrorist financing standards to target activists, administrative harassment through restrictive NGO laws (making registration and financing of NGOs difficult), and the smearing, harassment, attacks and killings of activists, [footnote 29] all of which has sadly become routine. [footnote 30] The groups most commonly affected were those advocating for womens rights and women HRDs , environmental groups, labour rights groups, LGBTI+ people and young people.\n\nThousands of criminal cases in Belarus have been launched against members of the opposition, civil society and HRDs . By the end of 2021, more than 300 CSOs had been, or were in the process of being, liquidated. At least 37,000 people were arbitrarily arrested and detained between May 2020 and May 2021. Evidence of torture and ill-treatment were found in a number of detention facilities. Prisoners are denied medical help, food and water, they are beaten and subject to excruciating treatment, and sexual and gender-based violence is used against all genders.\n\nGovernments continued to show little tolerance for questions over land rights and sovereignty disputes. In Indonesia, there was an increase in violence against civilians, disruption to internet services, and arrests of activists and journalists in the Papua region over the past year. The UK repeatedly reaffirmed its respect for Indonesias territorial integrity, including the provinces of Papua and West Papua, and continued to call for equitable development in the region. The UK continued to monitor the situation and supported calls for access to the region by the international community.\n\nInternational NGOs and donors increasingly faced jurisdictional barriers, with states imposing new regulatory requirements on organisations in receipt of foreign funding. Such rhetoric has been used to justify legal barriers to receiving foreign funding, with increasing numbers of countries proposing or enacting restrictions on the receipt of foreign funds.\n\nIn India, some NGOs faced difficulties due to the application of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) by the Indian authorities and some, like Oxfam India, had applications to renew their foreign funding licenses rejected in December 2021. The UK demonstrated its commitment to the civic space agenda by discussing these issues directly with the Indian government and the UK continues to support a wide range of local NGO partners in India, including through programmes.\n\nIn Tanzania, since President Samia Suluhu Hassan took office in March 2021 she has signalled a positive change in approach to human rights and fundamental freedoms, following a serious decline under her late predecessor. The UK has encouraged the repeal of various pieces of legislation which have unduly affected the freedom of civil society and the media to operate. The UK expressed at all levels to the Government of Tanzania the importance of ensuring a timely and transparent process for the trial of opposition leader Freeman Mbowe on terrorism charges.\n\nCivic space continued to be contested in the multilateral arena, with CSOs and HRDs facing intimidation and reprisals for engagement and cooperation with the UN , its representatives and mechanisms. Eighty countries signed the UKs Statement to the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly calling for members states to \"ensure all civil society organisations and human rights defenders can engage the UN without fear of intimidation or reprisal\".[footnote 31]\n\nHuman rights defenders\n\nAs part of its commitment to freedom and democracy, the UK supports the courageous work of HRDs globally. HRDs play a crucial role, often at great risk to themselves, in defending the full range of human rights. HRDs often document and report human rights violations and abuses and speak up for vulnerable and marginalised groups, bringing public attention to cases, holding governments to account and acting as agents of change.\n\nIn 2021, HRDs continued to play an important leadership role in protecting democracy and civic space wherever governments used COVID-19 to justify the restriction of human rights and the rule of law. According to the NGO Front Line Defenders, at least 358 HRDs were killed in 35 countries in 2021.[footnote 32] Other HRDs were threatened, arbitrarily detained, placed under surveillance or disappeared.\n\nThe UK continued its support for HRDs through bilateral engagement via our global diplomatic network and through multilateral organisations such as the UN . The UK diplomatic network has continued to monitor cases, observe trials, and raise issues with host governments. Our 2019 document UK support for Human Rights Defenders sets out the importance of HRDs to the UK and what the UK Government can and will do to support them.[footnote 33]\n\nIn Afghanistan, following the Taliban take-over in August, the UK has regularly supported Afghan women in particular to speak out in defence of their rights, including at the UN Security Council. The UK regularly raises human rights, including the right to freedom of expression, in our political engagement with the Taliban. Between April and December 2021, the UK brought around 7,900 Afghans to the UK under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) including through military evacuation flights. The UK also welcomed around 1,000 further people particularly at risk, including journalists, womens rights activists, members of the LGBT+ community and judges.[footnote 34]\n\nOperation Pitting: UK troops on route to evacuate Afghans at risk following the Taliban takeover in August 2021. UK MOD Crown copyright 2021\n\nIn Thailand, the protection of HRDs is a priority in light of reports of harassment, intimidation, and retaliatory lawsuits and of the use of the lse majest law and other charges to limit freedom of expression. The UK actively supported HRDs through project funding, direct engagement, trial observation, and activities in partnership with like-minded embassies. The UK implemented a range of projects supporting efforts to tackle strategic litigation against public participation, capacity building for HRDs , and strengthening HRD and media capacity to engage with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process.\n\nFreedom of expression\n\nFreedom of expression is essential to functioning democracies and enables a full range of other human rights. However, according to the Freedom in the World 2021 report, \"freedom of personal expression, which has experienced the largest declines of any democracy indicator since 2012, was further restrained during the COVID-19 health crisis\".[footnote 35]\n\nThe right to freedom of expression exists online as well as offline. The UK is committed to a free, open, peaceful and secure internet. In the first 5 months of 2021, the NGO Access Now documented at least 50 internet shutdowns in 21 countries worldwide.[footnote 36] The UK continued to support Access Now and its #KeepItOn campaign, which brought together a coalition of 243 organisations from 105 countries to counter internet shutdowns.\n\nThe UK also worked to defend a free, open and secure internet though our membership of the Freedom Online Coalition (FOC), a partnership of 34 member countries working to support internet freedom and protect human rights online globally.\n\nIn Syria, decades of systematic political oppression by the Syrian regime have deprived the country of autonomous spaces for civil society to operate. The regime has curtailed freedom of expression through arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances. Other groups in Syria, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, have continued to unlawfully and arbitrarily deprive civilians of their liberty, including journalists and women activists, who have been detained for exercising their fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary, then Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, met with civil society members Ibrahim Olabi and Mazen Gharibah in October 2021 to discuss human rights, accountability of crimes by the Syrian regime and the future of Syria.\n\nIn Uganda, arbitrary detention and torture have been used against government critics, members of the opposition and peaceful protestors who were exercising their right to freedom of expression. This has included those critical of the government on social media. The Ugandan government closed the internet for 5 days over the elections in January 2021. The UK has publicly raised our concerns and encourage the Government of Uganda to hold those responsible for human rights abuses to account.\n\nIn Vietnam, free expression is increasingly restricted, including online. Journalists, bloggers, activists and NGOs including climate and environmental activists peacefully expressing their views have been detained and given lengthy prison sentences. The UK has raised concerns directly with the Government of Vietnam, including during the former Foreign Secretarys visit in June 2021. The UK also publicly raised concerns around the time of Vietnams Universal Periodic Review mid-term report in December.\n\nSecurity and justice\n\nRespect for human rights is critical in the security and justice sector. 2021 saw some positive global developments on security and justice issues. For example, Bahrain took progressive steps, including by extending the use of alternative sentencing legislation and raising the age of criminal responsibility to 15 years (from 7). The UK continued to support the Government of Bahrains efforts to ensure the new legislation is implemented effectively.\n\nUnfortunately, backwards steps on justice and security were observed in other states in 2021. In Mali, Human Rights Watch documented a spate of alleged summary executions, enforced disappearances, and incommunicado detentions by government security forces.[footnote 37] In Syria, human rights violations and abuses continued unchecked across Assad regime-held territory including assassinations of opposition figures, arbitrary arrests and detention.\n\nDeath penalty\n\nThe UK Government opposes the use of the death penalty, in all circumstances, as a matter of principle.\n\n2021 saw both progress and regression globally in the use of the death penalty. Kazakhstan abolished the death penalty. In July 2021 the President of Sierra Leone signed the Abolition of the Death Penalty Bill into law.[footnote 38] The US imposed a federal-level moratorium on the death penalty but resumed executions via lethal injection in Oklahoma. In Pakistan, the Supreme Court revoked the death penalty for prisoners with mental health conditions, but the Senate opposed legislation that would have removed the death penalty for many drug offences. In Saudi Arabia, application of the death penalty increased from 2020 levels; however, it remains significantly lower than in 2018 to 2019 and some death sentences for prisoners who were minors when charged were overturned. In Bahrain, no death penalty sentences were issued however, 26 prisoners remain on death row.\n\nEstimates continue to indicate that China executes more people than the rest of the world combined. Iran also continued to rank as one of the most prolific users of the death penalty globally. In Iraq, widespread and indiscriminate use of the death penalty against Daesh suspects continued. In Egypt there was a sharp increase in the number of executions. In the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), the de facto administration in Gaza, Hamas, issued 16 death sentences in 2021.[footnote 39] The death penalty remains legal across the OPTs, though is not used in courts in the West Bank. Three individuals were executed in Japan. Belarus remained the only country in Europe to retain and administer the death penalty and in 2021, there were unsubstantiated reports of 2 executions.\n\nIn 2021, through both targeted bilateral interventions and working with multilateral institutions, the UK continued to work to bring an end to the use of the death penalty. To achieve this, the UK continued to support projects through the Magna Carta Fund which aim to abolish the death penalty, including the Death Penalty Project which facilitated training and legal intervention in Bangladesh, the Caribbean, Ghana, Guyana, Indonesia, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago and Zimbabwe.\n\nTorture prevention\n\nThe UK Government unreservedly condemns the use of torture in all circumstances. The UK is clear that it does not participate in, solicit, encourage or condone the use of torture for any purpose. Globally 2021 saw both some progress in preventing the use of torture but also continuing serious challenges.\n\nIn Bangladesh human rights groups estimated that law enforcement agencies were responsible for custodial deaths and incidents of torture, including 80 extra-judicial killings. In Iraq, the widespread use of torture to extract forced confessions in the criminal justice system continued. In Uzbekistan, many torture victims remained incarcerated for national security offences.\n\nIn 2021 the UK used the Magna Carta Fund to support projects which furthered its objectives on preventing torture and improving the treatment of detained persons, including the Association for the Prevention of Torture.\n\nArbitrary detention is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes, and its use is a means of political intimidation. In 2021, the UK continued to work both publicly and privately to condemn the use of arbitrary detention, in order to support those who have been arbitrarily detained and to demand accountability.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, arrests and detentions continued, as did reports of torture, neglect, lack of medical care and solitary confinement. In Myanmar, on 31 December 2021, a total of 8,338 people were arbitrarily detained;[footnote 40] including Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint. The UK secured a UNSC Press Statement on 8 December calling for the release of all those in arbitrary detention.[footnote 41]\n\nIn February, the UK joined Canada and other partners in signing the Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention in State-to-State Relations.[footnote 42] The purpose of the Declaration is to enhance international cooperation and end the practice of arbitrary arrest, detention or sentencing, to exercise leverage over foreign governments. It is a clear statement by a broad group of countries that this practice is unacceptable. The UK worked with Canada and others to develop a Partnership Action Plan to further tackle the issue,[footnote 43] and made tackling arbitrary detention a priority for our G7 presidency.[footnote 44] All G7 members signed the Declaration on 15 February 2021. As a signatory of the Declaration, the UK Government reaffirms its strong condemnation of the use of arbitrary arrest, detention, or sentencing of all people. The UK makes clear its abhorrence when it is used as part of a deliberate attempt to exert pressure on another government.\n\nOverseas Security and Justice Assistance\n\nOverseas Security and Justice Assistance ( OSJA ) guidance continues to be implemented across the UK Government, with advice from FCDO . The OSJA Guidance is the governments framework used to make assessments of human rights risks related to the UKs security and justice work overseas, and to identify suitable mitigation measures for those risks. This guidance ensures that UK overseas security and justice assistance work meets our human rights obligations and our values.\n\nThe table below gives an estimate of the number of new OSJA assessments completed across government during the financial year of 2021 to 2022, broken down by region.\n\nEstimated number of OSJA assessments completed across government for financial year 2021 to 2022\n\nRegion Assessments Europe 175 Central Asia 14 Americas 90 Middle East & North Africa 97 Sub Saharan Africa 51 South Asia 50 Asia Pacific 46\n\nExport controls\n\nExport licence applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis against strict export licensing criteria. Risks around human rights violations and abuses are a key part of the UKs assessment. The government will not grant a licence for items where it determines there is a clear risk that such items might be used to commit or facilitate internal repression, or where the UK determines there is a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law. The UK does not license equipment and technology where it determines there is a clear risk that the items would, overall, undermine peace and security, including internal peace and security. On 8 December, following a review of export controls, the UK Government announced the revised Strategic Export Licensing Criteria and strengthened Military End-Use Control.[footnote 45]\n\nPrivate sector: business and human rights\n\nThe private sector carries a responsibility to respect human rights, whether this is by businesses supporting the victims of forced labour and modern slavery, global security companies ensuring that their operations reduce the risk of human rights abuses or by ensuring that minerals are resourced responsibly.\n\nThe UKs 2021 G7 Presidency demonstrated continued leadership to ending modern slavery. At the G7 meeting in June, leaders reaffirmed their commitment to uphold human rights and committed to prevent, identify, and eliminate forced labour in global supply chains. In October, G7 Trade Ministers built on these commitments to eradicate forced labour, protect victims and improve global supply chain transparency, including by implementing the principles set out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. At the Annual Forum on Business and Human Rights in November, the Acting UK Migration and Modern Slavery Envoy set out UK action to help businesses tackle modern slavery.\n\nBilaterally, in India, through the FCDO s Work in Freedom programme, the Garment and Fashion Workers Union enrolled approximately 578 workers from 17 factories in Chennai, enabling workers to challenge labour issues including abusive work hours and forced overtime.\n\nVoluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights\n\nThe Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPs) provide tangible guidance for companies operating in high-risk and conflict-affected areas on how to manage their global security operations in a manner that reduces the risk of human rights abuses and conflict. The VPs are therefore a key tool for implementing the UN Guiding Principles and further detail on the UKs work on this can be found in the UKs 2021 Voluntary Principles Annual Report.[footnote 46]\n\nThe UK continued to support the Security and Human Rights Implementation Mechanism, a multi-donor fund committed to improving business, security and human rights through the implementation of international initiatives in fragile contexts. In 2021, UK funding supported projects focussing on the extractives and private security sectors in the DRC , Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria and Colombia.\n\nPrivate security companies\n\nAs a founder signatory to the Montreux Document, which reaffirms the international legal\n\nobligations of states and the activities of private military and security companies during armed conflict, the UK advocates for implementation of the Montreux Document via the International Code of Conduct. The Code sets out governance, industry principles and standards based on human rights and international humanitarian law. Compliance is monitored by the International Code of Conduct Association for Security Providers. The UK supports the Association through a seat on the Governing Board and through project funding, which in 2021 helped to build the capacity of private security companies and their clients on responsible security.\n\nResponsible sourcing of minerals\n\nTin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG, or so called conflict minerals) are key components of modern technology and, under the right conditions, the mining and trading of these metals and minerals can build prosperity and security for local communities. However, the risk remains that their supply chains are linked to a range of deplorable practices from human rights abuses to the illicit financing of conflict, as well as severe damage to the environment.\n\nThe Conflict Minerals (Compliance) (Northern Ireland) (EU Exit) Regulations (2020) came into force in Northern Ireland on 1 January. Based on the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, and as required under the Northern Ireland Protocol of the EU Withdrawal Agreement, the Regulations require the largest importers into Northern Ireland of 3TG to conduct and demonstrate due diligence to ensure that their imports have been mined and processed responsibly.\n\nA UK delegation participated in the inaugural OECD intergovernmental meeting of International Gold Trading Centres on responsible sourcing, which aims to build stronger international cooperation to tackle illicit financing in gold supply chains.\n\nUK engagement in the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM) focused on providing resources and support to SMEs through the UK-funded online portal - the EPRM Due Diligence Hub. The UK also funded a number of training webinars to increase capacity in the sector to implement due diligence in their mineral supply chains.\n\nThe Kimberley Process\n\nThe UK works within the Kimberley Process (KP) to stem the flow of conflict diamonds and prevent them from entering the legitimate trade, as well as tackling other abuses in the rough diamond industry. On 1 January, the UK began its independent participation in the KP (having previously been represented by the EU). Throughout the year, the UK worked with participants, industry and civil society to strengthen and enhance the KP through participation in intersessional and plenary meetings, and in KP working groups. UK participation in the KP and the activities of the Government Diamond Office enable the UK to take a leading role in preventing the rough diamond industry from fuelling conflict.\n\nModern slavery\n\nAround the world, approximately 40 million people have been forced into modern slavery.[footnote 47] The UK remained committed in 2021 to the eradication by 2030 of all forms of modern slavery, forced labour and human trafficking, as set out in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8.7 and pledged its support for the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour in 2021. The FCDO published its first annual modern slavery statement on 25 November,[footnote 48] which sets out how the FCDO is committed to tackling modern slavery in its own supply chains.\n\nThe G7 Summit demonstrated how the UK is revitalising cooperation between democratic, open societies to tackle the most pressing global challenges, including modern slavery. The government engaged with international partners, in particular through the UK Migration and Modern Slavery Envoy who used this role by: [footnote 49]\n\nholding talks with the UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, including on forced labour in Xinjiang\n\nSpecial Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, including on forced labour in Xinjiang strengthening UK partnerships with key stakeholders and encouraged coordination between key actors such as the Alliance 8.7 Global Partnership and the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons\n\nlaunching the high profile, UK-funded report Developing Freedom, which analysed how ending modern slavery can contribute to sustainable development agenda.\n\nThe second year of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact some of the poorest and most vulnerable across the world, including victims of modern slavery.[footnote 50] A major concern for the UK is the risk that the pandemic reverses years of progress towards ending modern slavery.\n\nThe pandemic affected millions of jobs in both the garment and domestic sectors in Bangladesh. An increase in unpaid wages and other worker grievances was also observed by our implementing partners. This increased the vulnerability of women to forced labour and exploitation. UK support helped the Work in Freedom programme to adapt its interventions in response, by focusing on local employment. Interventions included increasing the awareness of local garment and domestic workers of their labour rights and establishing linkages for work-age women and girls to local employment/vocational opportunities.\n\nIn Malaysia, there was some progress, including remediation payments to some workers in the Personal Protective Equipment manufacturing sector and the launch of a National Action Plan to tackle forced labour.[footnote 51] However, modern slavery, particularly the treatment of migrant workers, remained a concern in manufacturing sectors. The UK continued to work with the Malaysian government, manufacturers and civil society to improve the protection of migrant workers and tackle labour abuses.\n\nIn Indonesia, the UK supported the Indonesian governments efforts to tackle modern slavery. The UK has supported research on labour laws and regulations as well as practices in the fisheries industry to contribute towards building a legal and institutional system that will protect Indonesian migrant workers from modern slavery practices.\n\nIn India, the UK supported partners to strengthen the capacity of law enforcement agencies to prevent human trafficking in Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Gujarat, and to prevent bonded labour in Rajasthan and Telangana. Child protection systems were improved in select districts of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam and West Bengal, working with district and Panchayat authorities. Over 15 million families of vulnerable children from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were linked to social protection schemes.\n\nThe Modern Slavery Fund (MSF) and the Modern Slavery Innovation Fund (MSIF), managed by the Home Office, continued to implement programmes internationally. In Albania, the MSF supported the development of the National Action Plan on trafficking, approved in November, while continuing to provide essential reintegration support to victims of trafficking. In Vietnam, law enforcement training, supported by the MSF and incorporated into the Peoples Police Academy, means that successive classes of police recruits will be better able to identify and respond to trafficking cases. Projects across Sudan, Ethiopia, South Africa, India, Malaysia, Mauritius, Indonesia and USA (New York) supported legislative change, capacity building, victim welfare, workers rights and global research initiatives.\n\nIn March, the UK Government launched an online modern slavery statement registry and is now encouraging all organisations in scope of section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 to submit their statement to the registry. By the end of 2021, 6,860 statements were submitted, covering 22,410 organisations. In the future, the UK will mandate organisations to submit their statement to the registry.\n\nMigration and human rights\n\nThe UN estimated there were 281 million international migrants globally in 2021.[footnote 52] The International Organization for Migration (IOM) observed that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing socio-economic vulnerabilities for many migrants, including preventing them from being able to return home.\n\nIrregular migration continued to expose migrants to risks of exploitation and human rights abuses by organised crime groups. The UN estimated that 4,470 migrants lost their lives along migration routes worldwide, with at least 32 migrant deaths in the English Channel, including the tragic events in November when 27 people died attempting to cross from France to the UK. These crossings are dangerous and are often facilitated by criminals. The UK continued to work with international partners on a whole of route approach to tackling the challenges of irregular migration, including investing 54 million in priority work with France in 2021 to 2022.\n\nThrough the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund ( CSSF ), the UK provided migration management capacity to Nigeria and Niger to help them better respond to people trafficking, cross-border crime and modern slavery. The CSSF helped develop Turkeys ability to address its migration challenges, strengthening the provision of services to vulnerable refugees, including women, girls and young refugees, as well as enhancing human rights compliance in the management of irregular migrants.\n\nThe UK continued to meet commitments made under the Withdrawal Agreement to the EU Trust Fund for Africa and the Facility for Refugees in Turkey,[footnote 53] where UK funding from 2016 to 2023 supports 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey. In particular, UK funding supports refugees living in vulnerable situations, whilst also supporting their host communities in providing access to quality education, health, protection and livelihoods. The UK also provided the IOM with approximately 75 million, making us its third largest bilateral donor. IOM delivered programmes in over 100 countries, including providing humanitarian assistance to forced migrants, refugees and other vulnerable groups.\n\nThe UK continued to make clear our expectation that all states should discharge their international obligations towards migrants with full respect for human rights. The UK condemned the Belarusian regimes actions in engineering a migrant crisis to try to undermine Poland and others in the region for political purposes, highlighting their disregard for international norms. The UK supported humanitarian partners working to alleviate the suffering of migrants at the Belarus border, including through political advocacy and contributions to the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund.\n\nIn line with the UN Global Compact for Migration, the FCDO continued to support efforts to ensure more global migration was safe, orderly and regular, including providing 3.7 million from 2019 to 2021 to the Multi-Partner Trust Fund, which supported UN Member States implementation of the Compacts commitments in their countries. The FCDO also launched the Better Regional Migration Management programme, aiming to maximise the socio-economic benefits of safe and regular migration in East Africa, contributing to poverty reduction and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that global forced displacement surpassed 84 million in mid-2021,[footnote 54] and the latest data (from 2020) suggests conflict and violence triggered 48 million displacements - the highest ever figure recorded. [footnote 55]\n\nThe UK continued to be a strong supporter of UNHCR and provided 56m in funding acro",

                "cc_text": "2022: The year in pictures\n\nThe world witnessed an unwieldy and unparalleled set of news events in 2022. It was a year that captured historically significant and surprising moments, triggering disbelief and despair. Yet some days offered joy and pride.From Russias war in Ukraine to the mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, to the death of Queen Elizabeth II, these are some of the remarkable stories of the year.The year started, calmly, as the world slowly began to come out of a long, drawn-out pandemic hibernation.However, consistent with the brittleness of these modern times, a full-blown war erupted in Ukraine in February as Russia invaded the country, ending and upending the lives of many, including civilians and children. Photographer Evgeniy Maloletka captured one of the most vivid pictures of the war for the Associated Press, showing a photo of an ashen-face pregnant woman, holding her lower abdomen, being carried on a stretcher moments after a bomb was launched at a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine. The unnamed woman and her baby died days later.This image has come to symbolize one of many Russian atrocities in the war in Ukraine. The attack on March 9, just 13 days after the war started, was one of the most brutal days of the conflict that continues to this day.In June, the United States once again witnessed a school shooting, this time in Uvalde, Texas. Photographer Pete Luna of the Uvalde Leader-News photographed the chaotic scene outside the school as young elementary students ran for safety while the gunman was still inside.And on September 8, Queen Elizabeth II died at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, sending shockwaves around the world. The 96-year-old monarch had worked with 15 British prime ministers, from Winston Churchill to Liz Truss. She died two days after inviting Truss to form a new government. The Queens funeral drew crowds by the tens of thousands as they paid their last respects to a monarch who reigned for an unprecedented 70 years.This was also a year of firsts. The United States saw the confirmation of the countrys first Black woman Supreme Court justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson. At the Winter Olympics, American Erin Jackson became the first Black woman to win an individual medal in speedskating. And history was made with the first all-female refereeing crew at a mens World Cup.Another notable moment this year was the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision that guaranteed the federal constitutional right to an abortion in the United States. The courts decision this year triggered protests by abortion-rights activists and celebrations in the streets by anti-abortion groups, further ideologically separating an already divided country.In November, Americans went to the polls, producing election results that defied polling expectations.As all these moments unraveled, the Earth continued to warm up, melting and separating glacial ice ridges while much of the Northern Hemisphere dealt with a historic drought that scorched soil, dried up rivers and triggered mass crop failure.Far above the Earth, the James Webb Space Telescope captured magnificent images of space in great, crisp detail.On the other end of the news spectrum was the bizarre moment at this years Academy Awards when Will Smith brazenly slapped Chris Rock in the middle of the show, irked by what the comedian said about his wife. The moment was witnessed live on television by millions around the globe.This summer, many sports fans rooted for Aaron Judge as he broke fellow Yankee Roger Maris American League home run record in a single season, a remarkable feat.Interwoven with these big news events were snapshots of daily life reminding the world of the beautiful, quiet and sometimes hilarious moments in and out of peoples lives.And behind all the top photos this year is the hard work of photojournalists. Many of them continue to document wars and conflicts, away from the safety of their homes. It is thanks to their perseverance and dedication that these images come to light, offering a window to the world and helping us understand it through photography.This is CNN Digitals \"2022: The year in pictures.",

Putin, but only in consultation with NATO allies and only if the Russian leader indicated he was \"looking for a way to end the war.\"\n\nMr. Bidens public expression of conditioned willingness to reach out to Mr. Putin gratified French officials and provided unexpected support for President Emmanuel Macrons outreach. Mr. Biden noted that Mr. Putin had shown no interest yet in ending his invasion, but said that if that changed, \"Ill be happy to sit down with Putin to see what he has in mind.\"\n\nEvidently determined to present a united front during a White House news conference that at times resembled a love fest, Mr. Macron said that France would increase its military support for Ukraine and \"will never urge Ukrainians to make a compromise that will not be acceptable for them.\"\n\nIn effect, the two leaders met each other halfway, with Mr. Biden showing more openness to a negotiated settlement and Mr. Macron more unequivocal support for the Ukrainian cause. If partially choreographed, the meeting of minds appeared to exceed expectations on both sides.",

The European Peace Facility, which currently has a ceiling of about 6 billion, reimburses governments for military deliveries to Ukraine, but is also used to support other countries. More than half of the fund has been pledged for military aid to Ukraine and member states see the need for further support. EU foreign ministers could sign off on the 2 billion increase when they meet in Brussels on Dec. 12, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. If not finalized by then, EU leaders could take up the matter later in the week. The proposal requires the unanimous approval of all member states. The facility could be topped up with even more money at a later date, the people said.",

                "cc_text": "Image Source: CNBC\n\nThe Kuomintang (KMT) party had much to celebrate on November 26. Not only did its candidates win 13 of the 21 cities and counties in Taiwans 2022 midterm elections, but the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) captured only five seats, the fewest since its founding in 1986. President Tsai Ing-wen, who has achieved international acclaim in recent years for being a strong female leader and champion of democracy, stepped down as chairwoman of the DPP after disappointing results for her party. Perhaps even more newsworthy, Chiang Kai-sheks great-grandson, 43-year-old Chiang Wan-an, won the seat of Taipeis mayorshipone of the most coveted positions in Taiwanese politics and a historical predictor of future presidential candidates.\n\nFor those of us watching from the United States, it can be easy to interpret the KMTs victories as a return to pro-China politics among Taiwanese voters. After all, when Chiang Kai-shek led the KMT retreat to Taiwan in 1949, it had every intention of reclaiming the mainland from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Since Taiwan ended martial law and transformed into a democracy in the 1990s, the KMT, or Nationalist Party, has traditionally favored friendlier ties with the mainland, often on the basis of economic growth. Contrastingly, championing the nationalist Taiwanese identity, the opposition DPP has been more vocal about ambitions for independence.\n\nHowever, the results of Taiwans 2022 midterm elections had very little to do with cross-Strait relations and prospects for either reunification or independence. Instead, the \"blue wave\" that is, the overwhelming victory of candidates whose ideologies lean most similarly toward that of the KMTs, in contrast with the DPPs \"green\" likely reflected dissatisfaction with DPP rule on domestic issues.\n\nFor example, although the island received international praise for its handling of the pandemic, the Taiwanese populace has not commended the DPPs COVID-era actions with similar sentiments. From blocking specific vaccines and delaying the lowering of COVID diagnosis standards to excessively expanding political power through infringements on freedom of speech, people have grown dissatisfied with the governing party. The pandemic has also led to high inflation, rising housing prices, and general economic stagnation. In fact, 42.6% of the Taiwanese public gave its government a non-passing score on its pandemic response.\n\nOthers have complained that the DPP has become all talk and no bite. Though many voters found solace in the partys championing of democratic values and progressive ideals in prior elections, the lives of everyday people have not appeared to improve. With an increasing gap between the rich and the poor and measly job prospects, especially for younger generations, people have become disillusioned with the DPP. As a result, turnout at this years midterm elections was extremely low at 58.97 percent a referendum seeking to lower the voting age from 20 to 18 did not even reach enough votes to pass.\n\nSimilarly, the DPPs fear-mongering tactics about CCP threats have become less effective. When Tsai Ing-wen ran for re-election in 2020, CCP authorities were violently cracking down on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. \"Hong Kong today, Taiwan tomorrow (),\" she had chanted as part of her campaign. Before the pandemic and its inevitable economic consequences, people rallied behind Tsais democratic fervor; she eventually won by a historic landslide with 57.1% of the vote.\n\nToday, the political landscape is very different, and voters in Taiwan are seeking a fresh perspective on possibilities for their islands future. The DPPs slogan \"Resist China, Protect Taiwan ()\" has not struck the same chord. Two days before the election, Taiwans Foreign Minister Joseph Wu affirmed that the \"China factor\" has become less of an issue in Taiwanese politics, explaining that, though still frequent, mainland meddling in Taiwanese elections has decreased in recent years and that the PRC is likely more concerned with its own domestic issues.\n\nIndeed, Taiwanese citizens have been living under threat of CCP invasion for nearly 70 years; not every election is a reflection of international relations. While CCP incursions into Taiwans air defense identification zone (ADIZ) have increased considerably in recent months, Taiwanese voters turned out for the party that has been less aggressive about achieving internationally-recognized independence, especially when the island already functions independently in virtually every aspect but name. That the recently victorious party has historically been \"friendlier\" with the CCP is simply coincidental. Just like elections in the United States and elsewhere, voters choices are not binary and should not be understood as such.\n\nUS political analysts, China watchers, and government officials would be remiss to misinterpret these midterm election results as a step back for Taiwans stiffening China policy, even if KMT victories were the CCPs preferred outcome (and actually lead to a temporary stabilizing of cross-Strait relations). Perhaps such anxieties can wait for the next presidential election in 2024.",

                "cc_text": "(As delivered)\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nHello everyone and welcome to the sixth edition of The Global Boardroom. I feel as if I say this every time we hold a Global Boardroom, that we're living in dangerous times with multiple crises. But I think the world is getting even more complicated. With war, recession, inflation, energy crisis, climate emergency. In a few minutes, I'll be speaking to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on how the war in Ukraine now in its 10th month has upended the international order. Two weeks ago, I witnessed first-hand, the consequences of the new phase of the war and that is the war to destroy Ukrainian infrastructure. Kyiv was dark, very dark and cold with no water for 24 hours. But people went about their daily lives, hardly even reacting to the sirens warning them of incoming missile strikes. Although much of the power network was hit during the strikes, Ukrainians picked up the pieces and fixed the network within a day. Ukrainians have surprised us with their resilience and their ability to defend their country and they keep surprising us every day.\n\nThroughout this events, therell be different sessions dealing with Ukraine. Our Chief Foreign Affairs Commentator, Gideon Rachman, has been following the conflict closely and is moderating and excellent panel on the geopolitics. It'll be broadcast later today. But we'll take you beyond Europe as well, we're holding The Global Boardroom just a few weeks after the National People's Congress in Beijing approved a third term for President Xi Jinping and only days after unprecedented protests against the draconian COVID restrictions. Our expert panel tomorrow will analyse what Xis third term might bring. Geopolitical tensions are, of course, a key factor in the global economic crisis. With inflation in Western economies reaching levels not seen for decades, though it does appear to have peaked. Martin Wolf, our Chief Economic Commentator will tell us in two separate panels how policy makers in advanced and emerging economies should respond. Here, in the UK, were back to economic sanity. But along with that comes austerity and recession. The Chancellor will be joining us on Friday for a live interview with our political editor George Parker. The Global Boardroom also comes just a short time after the close of the COP27 in Egypt. Later today, we will review the latest COP and ask whether these meetings have lost their purpose. Climate and energy security are big themes on all three days of the event with discussions on Joe Bidens seven hundred billion dollar tax and climate bill, Europes energy security dilemma, Australias clean energy transition and much more. I hope you enjoy this Global Boardroom and thank you for joining us.\n\nNow lets get started. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, welcome.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nThank you so much for having me, Roula. Great to see you again.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nVery happy to have you amongst us. Ill dive right into it. As I was saying in my introduction, I was in Kyiv a couple of weeks ago and I was really struck by the confidence of Ukrainians. Not only their resilience. But their confidence. They now speak of winning the war next year and recapturing all of the territory. Not even just the territory occupied since February 24. So let me ask you: Do you think that next year we will see a return to the February 24 lines, at least?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nFirst of all, we need to understand that wars are really hard to predict. NATO was very precise in predicting the invasion. We actually disclosed, shared intelligence more than more than one year ago, last fall. Many months before the invasion, saying exactly was actually going to happen. That Russia was planning, preparing a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. So when the invasion happened, we were well prepared, we activated our defence plans and we deployed tens of thousands of more troops in the eastern part of the Alliance. And we started to provide even more support to Ukraine. What we see now is Russia is actually trying to have some kind of freeze of this war at least for a short period of time to they can regroup, repair, recover. And then try to launch a bigger offensive next spring. So what we do, we support Ukraine in their right for self-defence. Ukraine is defensing their own country and NATO Allies and partners are providing unprecedented support to those efforts by the Ukrainians.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nThis freeze is what the Ukrainians are most worried about. Because they think that what will eventually happen, the longer this freeze lasts, the more fatigue there will be in the West. Do you worry about that as well?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nI think we need to understand that President Putin made two big strategic mistakes when he decided to invade Ukraine. The first was to totally underestimate the Ukrainians, the bravery and the courage of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Ukrainian people and also the Ukrainian political leadership with President Zelenskyy. But he also underestimated the strength of NATO Allies and partners in our commitment to stand by Ukraine, to support Ukraine.\n\nNATO Allies have supported Ukraine for many years, especially since 2014. Especially Allies like the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, have trained the Ukrainian Armed Forces so they were much bigger, much stronger, much better equipped now, in February 2022, than when Russia invaded the first time in 2014. So what we have demonstrated over the years and especially since the invasion, is that Allies are ready to support Ukraine, because they realise that if Putin wins, it will be a tragedy for Ukrainians, but it will also be extremely serious for all of us. It will make NATO Allies more vulnerable and the world more dangerous and therefore we cannot allow President Putin to win.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nSo let me ask you this. Should NATO members Given the state of the conflict right now, should NATO members be willing to give the kind of offensive weapons like tanks and advanced fighter jets that will allow Ukrainian forces to break this freeze and not to give any advantage to the Russians?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nNATO Allies have and are providing an unprecedented level of military support to Ukraine, also with modern systems. Allies have provided armoured vehicles, also battle tanks, advanced air defence systems and a wide range of different weapons. But I cannot go into the specific systems we are now considering. We are always considering to add more systems. But I think that as important as adding new systems is to ensure that the systems, the weapons, we have already delivered are actually operational, are working in an effective way meaning that they need a vast amount of ammunition, spare parts and also maintenance.\n\nSo for instance, we have advanced HIMARS systems, we have advanced air defence systems like the NASAMS, or the Crotale and the RST from Germany. So yes, we are considering constantly what kind of systems we should deliver. But it's extremely important to ensure that the systems which are already there are operational with the ammunition, spare parts and all the support they need.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nYou would have definitely noticed and probably you're studying what happened only yesterday when drones were used to attack a Russian military base. Can you tell us much about these drones? Did you know that Ukrainians were making these drones?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nI have no more information about those specific incidents. But what I can say is that what we see is that Ukraine is defending themselves. And we need to understand this in the wider context. We see daily attacks by Russia on Ukrainian cities, on critical infrastructure. So what Russia tries to do is to weaponise winter, to deprive civilian Ukrainians of water, of electricity, of heating, when they're now going into winter. And this is a brutal kind of warfare that actually affects all civilians. And it shows the brutality of the Russian invasion. And of course, Ukraine has the right to defend itself against these kinds of attacks.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nWe're hearing more noises about the need to enter, to launch, negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. It's something that makes Ukrainians very nervous. It's not clear what Russia's position is. Do you think it is time for negotiations?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nIt has to be Ukraine that decides when and the conditions for negotiations. And of course, they are also concerned about these attempts by Russia to try to have a kind of short break or a short freeze of the conflict so Russia can recover their troops, regroup and then launch a bigger offensive later on because now Ukraine has the momentum.\n\nMost wars, and most likely also this war, will end at the negotiating table. But we know that what happens around that table is absolutely dependent on the situation on the battlefield. So if you want an outcome of those negotiations, which ensures that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign, independent nation, we need to provide military support to Ukraine. And the only lasting peace has to be a just peace. If the aggressor wins, that will not give us a lasting peace. So the paradox is that the more we want a peaceful negotiated solution ensuring that Ukraine prevails, the more urgent it is that we provide military support for Ukraine to create the conditions for a just, lasting peace in Ukraine.\n\nRoula Khalaf: What I'm hearing from you is that the conditions are not there yet.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nThe conditions are not there now because Russia has shown no sign of engaging in negotiations which are respecting the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. And again, it's not for NATO, it's not for Brussels to decide. It's for the Ukrainians to decide when the time is right to start to negotiate and to agree the conditions.\n\nThis is about a sovereign, independent, democratic nation which is defending itself against a war of aggression. And of course, they have the right to defend themselves. We support them. The right of self defence is enshrined in the UN treaty. And that's also the reason why we support them.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nFrom what we hear there are qualms in some capitals today about the idea of Ukraine retaking the Crimean peninsula by force, because that could potentially push Moscow to nuclear escalation. Do you share these concerns?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nAgain, we need to understand what this is. This is a war of aggression. Russia has illegally annexed, invaded, another country, Ukraine. And we are supporting Ukraine. At some stage this war will most likely end at the negotiating table. But the likelihood of any acceptable outcome increases with our support to Ukraine, it's absolutely linked on what happens on the battlefield.\n\nThen what we have seen, this nuclear rhetoric from Russia, from the Russian side, especially earlier this fall, is reckless, is dangerous. And Russia must know that any use of nuclear weapons would totally change the character, the nature, of the conflict and a nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nHow do you think NATO members can deter Russia from nuclear escalation? Do you think, you know, a few weeks ago when there was a lot of talk about the use of tactical nuclear weapons, was that a bit exaggerated?\n\nNATO Secretary General: I think what we saw, more some weeks ago than now, was a lot of rhetoric from Moscow, from President Putin, that increased concerns among NATO Allies and others about the potential use of these weapons. We have seen less of that recently. But we remain vigilant, we monitor closely what Russia is doing.\n\nAnd we send the very clear and Allies have sent a very clear message to Russia that it will have severe consequences for Russia, and also of course that a nuclear war must never be fought.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nWhat have you learned about Vladimir Putin over the past year and do you think he can survive losing this war?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nSo what we have learned is his willingness to use brutal force to achieve his political goals. And that's exactly why it is important that he doesn't win, because if President Putin wins in Ukraine, it will also end with the outcome that an independent sovereign nation in Europe has been attacked by another nation and the aggressor wins. That will also send a very bad message to authoritarian leaders all over the world and also to President Putin, that when they use force, when they violate international law and when they invade another country, they can achieve what they want.\n\nAnd that will embolden them to use even more force and to do it again. So that's the reason why it is in our security interest to ensure that President Putin doesnt win, because what we have learned is that he has a willingness to use force to achieve goals; many people hoped that was not the case but we have seen the opposite now.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nDo you think that NATO can have a peaceful relationship with Russia if Mr. Putin remains in power, assuming there is a conclusion to this war?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nI think what we need to realise is that NATO for decades strived for a constructive and better relationship with Russia, for a meaningful dialogue. Actually, just weeks before the invasion, we made written proposals on how to engage with Russia to try to prevent the war, to address some of the concerns they raised. But President Putin decided to just go ahead with his invasion regardless of our attempts to find a political solution. So we need to realise that when this war ends, it doesn't mean that we go back to some kind of good or normal relationship with Russia.\n\nWe need to be prepared for a difficult relationship with Russia for a long time, meaning that we need to invest in our defence, we need to continue to strengthen NATOs collective deterrence and defence to ensure that the conflict in Ukraine doesn't escalate to become a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia. And of course, we cannot go back and be dependent on Russian gas. These are the long term consequences that will be there also after the war has ended.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nPresident Macron, as you would have heard earlier, last week, spoke of a security architecture. Is there work underway on some kind of post Ukraine war security architecture and what would that involve?\n\nNATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg:\n\nI think we have to do this now in the right order. First of all, President Putin started a war of aggression, and he can end this war tomorrow. Second, our main responsibility, the urgent task, is to support Ukraine to defend themselves and to create the conditions for a negotiated solution that ensures that Ukraine prevails as an independent sovereign nation in Ukraine. That has to be the basis for any negotiated solution. And again, it has to be Ukraine that decides what are acceptable conditions for them and need to try it for many years. And even as, as I said, just weeks before the invasion we were trying to engage with Russia, to engage in issues like arms control, and transparency, risk reduction and other issues that we need to work on.\n\nWe of course, after the end of the war, we need to continue to have a relationship with Russia, meaning that we need to have military lines of communications, we need to engage in arms control. But I think that this war has demonstrated the importance of having strong collective defence. NATO's increased military presence in eastern part of the Alliance with battlegroups, with high readiness, with more defence spending. And this is something that we have done actually since 2014, we were not surprised. The war didn't start in 20 in February this year, it started in 2014. But we need to do more of this to ensure that there is no room for miscalculation or misunderstanding in Moscow about NATO s readiness to protect or defend all Allies. By doing that we are not provoking conflict, but we are preventing conflict, preserving peace.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nJust going back a little bit to the past. Do you think that a lot of governments misunderstood Putin and his and his intention?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nI think it's very difficult to speculate about that. What that welcome, is that is especially since 2014, all NATO Allies realised that we live in a more dangerous world. So after the end of the Cold War, NATO Allies reduced defence spending, reduced the number of soldiers we had in in Europe. After 2014 we have implemented the biggest reinforcement to our collective defence since the end of the Cold War. For the first time in our history we have a battle groups in the eastern part of the Alliance. We have tens of thousands of troops under NATO command backed by significant air and naval power and we also made important decisions now in June to further strengthen our deterrence and defence. And the good thing is, that since 2014, all NATO Allies have invested more in defence.\n\nSo I think all this reflects that while there may be different assessments, different analysis in different capitals, that's natural, we are 30 Allies, but what we have done together is to demonstrate the will to actually do more. And the paradox is that President Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he wanted. He went to war to get less NATO. What he has seen is more NATO. More NATO military presence in the eastern part of the Alliance, more NATO membership, Finland and Sweden are joining NATO as a direct consequence of Russias brutal war and Finland in NATO means that we are doubling the border with Russia. So President Putin made big mistakes, strategic mistakes, when he invaded Ukraine, and that is also reflected in the fact that he's actually getting more NATO plus NATO supporters.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nLet me ask you a question that a lot of people ask me, which is that we've all been celebrating obviously the unity of the West and of NATO since February.\n\nWhen you compare that to the pull-out from Afghanistan to even the military interventions in Libya and Syria. The question is, why did it take an invasion on the European continent to bring about such unity?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nBut I don't agree with that analysis. Because what we have seen is that yes, there are differences between NATO Allies and there have always been differences among NATO Allies going back to the Suez Crisis in 1956. Or the Iraq war in 2003. There have been disagreements or differences between NATO Allies, but we have always been able to unite around our core task to protect and defend each other.\n\nYou're right, that after in the Cold War, we've built down our military presence in Europe because we all hoped for and believed in a more peaceful world and more peaceful Europe and we strived for a more constructive relationship with Russia. But since 2014, we have seen an enormous change in NATO. And this has been reflected both in what we do on the ground, with the weapons systems, but also establishing new military domains, cyber space and investing in high-end new advanced weapons systems to protect ourselves and therefore also when the invasion happened in February, we were well prepared. We activated defence plans that gave more authority to our Supreme Allied Commander SACEUR, we deployed additional troops, we doubled the number of battle groups in the eastern part of the Alliance. So the thing that in a way that we were surprised and now . this was a wake up call? Well, we have been very much awake for many years, and that has been reflected in the big transformation of NATO since 2014.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nThere's been another wake up call this year. And that's on China.\n\nCan NATO find that same unity when it comes to China, given the very vast differences between the US and say, Germany, on China's threat to Western economies?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nYes, and we have been able to do that, too. So you're right, that previously China was not on the NATO agenda at all. The first time we addressed China as NATO Alliance was back in 2019. But in our new Strategic Concept, which we agreed in June this year, we actually address China extensively in agreed terms. In our most important document, the Strategic Concept, where we say clearly that China is not an adversary, we need to continue to engage with China. I recently met with the Chinese foreign minister, we need to engage with them on issues like climate change and many other arms control.\n\nBut at the same time, we need to take into account that the rise of China might destroy our security. They are investing heavily in new modern new tech capabilities. They're cracking down on democratic rights as we saw in Hong Kong, the minorities in China, but you also see their coercive behaviour against neighbours. And then China is coming closer to us.\n\nAnd I think that one of the lessons we have learned from the war in Ukraine is that it's dangerous to be too depend on authoritarian regimes for essential commodities like Russian gas. Of course, we dont the same mistake I made too dependent on critical commodities coming from China.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nYou mentioned Finland and Sweden and you have publicly stated that it would be a quick process of membership, and it hasn't really been quick.\n\nHas NATO's credibility been damaged by Trkiye and Hungary's decision not to yet ratify membership?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nSo far this has been the quickest accession process in NATOs modern history, we have to remember that Finland and Sweden applied for membership in May, and then in June, all NATO Allies, also Trkiye invited Finland and Sweden to become members. All NATO Allies signed the accession protocols.\n\nAnd so far 28 out of 30 Allies have ratified the protocols in the national parliaments and this is by NATO standards very quick, I agree that two Allies have not ratified. Hungary has promised to do it early next year. I visited Trkiye a few weeks ago, and I'm confident that also Trkiye will ratify and I think the time has come for all Allies to finalise the ratification process.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nAnd Jens, my last question is about you. Your term was extended earlier this year for another 12 months to next September, I believe.\n\nSome people are saying that you are open to another extension given the ongoing war in Ukraine. Some countries are also apparently open to that. Would you contemplate staying on or are you committed to stepping down next year?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nI have no other plans than to focus on my work until the end of September next year. And that's the only plan I have. I'm absolutely certain that they will be able to find a good successor following me.\n\nRoula Khalaf:\n\nOkay. thanks so much for being with us. This has been a great conversation.",

Ladies and gentlemen, Secretary General Stoltenberg was so kind to give us some minutes for questions and answers. There's microphones in the in the hallways. And so for most of us, this is a rare chance to ask. Microphones are being brought to you, I would kindly ask to introduce yourself with name and professional activity. And to ask one question, please, the floor is open.\n\nQuestion\n\nHello, I'm Nicolas (inaudible) representing parliament of Georgia. First of all, thank you your introductory speech. And thank you for your support towards Georgia. Actually I have two questions: The first question is, do you think that it was a mistake not to grant Georgia MAP in 2008? And my other question is, how do you see the role of Georgia in Black Sea security in a short term period? Thank you.\n\nModerator\n\nMicrophone please.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\n\nFirst of all, Georgia is a highly valued partner for NATO. And we are actually stepping up our cooperation with Georgia. That was a clear message from the summit of NATO leaders in Madrid in June and it was reiterated at the foreign ministerial meeting I just came from in Bucharest earlier this week. And where also the Georgian Foreign Minister participated. And it was a clear message that we need to do more together with the Georgia.\n\nWe have strengthened our political cooperation, our practical support, and also realizing of course, that is, reflecting the fact that the whole Black Sea region is of great strategic importance for the Alliance. NATO, in general, has increased its presence in the Black Sea region. Both of course, because we have three littoral states, Trkiye, Bulgaria and Romania as members, but also, of course, because both Ukraine and Georgia are close and valued partners. And we will continue to step up and not least in face of the aggressive policies of Russia, we see the importance of working with partners like Georgia.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Next question is at the eighth row (inaudible).\n\nQuestion\n\nThank you very much for your comments. Secretary General. My name is Robert (inaudible), I would like to ask you, what are your views on strengthening the resilience also in our societies, in our western societies, to keep up the activities of NATO in this brutal war?\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\n\nThe resilience is a very important part of our security, we cannot have strong defences without having strong societies. Therefore, resilience has been on the top of the NATO agenda for a long time. But of course, in the security environment, where we face more hybrid threats, where we also see the vulnerabilities and the challenges in cyberspace, resilience has become even more important.\n\nSo therefore in NATO we have developed the resilience guidelines, we have focused on how to protect critical infrastructure. And as (inaudible) just mentioned, also the challenges faced related to undersea infrastructure, pipelines, cables.\n\nSo we need to focus on resilience. This is also linked to how we engage economically with authoritarian powers. Free trade has served us all well. I still believe that we benefit from free trade. But we need to realize that when we engage economically with authoritarian powers, like Russia on gas, or like with China on some critical commodities, rare earth minerals, for instance, it has consequences for our securities.\n\nSo these decisions cannot only be made based on commercial considerations, you have to take into account the security consequences or for instance, being dependent on Russian gas, or over dependent on some specific commodities for from China. So resilience is about many aspects, including trade and economy.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you very much (inaudible).\n\nQuestion\n\n(Inaudible). You spoke about the (inaudible) of rockets and missiles, and strengthening the air defence. Would we need to look at hitting not only the flying missiles, but hit the launching places from where they come?\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\n\nNATO's is not party to the conflict in Ukraine. We have no troops, and we have no presence in the air of Ukraine. What NATO does is that we support Ukraine in its right for self-defence, right, which is enshrined in the UN Charter. And then we provide support to Ukraine, with weapons that help them to defend themselves. And that includes, of course, also, air defence systems, artillery, HIMARS, and also a lot of advanced weapon systems.\n\nAnd I would like to praise and commend Germany for being one of the Allies that is providing the most when it comes to different types of weapons, ammunition and military support to Ukraine. And we have seen that this has made a huge difference on the ground. By being able to push back the Russian troops, the invading forces. First in the north, around Kiev, then in the east around Kharkiv, then in the south around Kherson.\n\nIt's not for us to decide. What matters is that we enable the Ukrainians to defend themselves and the message from NATO Allies is that we will sustain, step up and ensure that Ukraine gets weapons, ammunition and that we are ready to support them for as long as it takes.\n\nModerator\n\nI think, the gentleman here, then Walter, than the gentleman, there and then two gentlemen in fifth and sixth row.\n\nQuestion\n\nClaus Whitman, former Brigadier General. I teach contemporary history at Potsdam University and this semester recent history of Ukraine. Sir, apart from air defence and artillery, it is clear that Ukraine also needs armoured combat vehicles. And since the German government does not want to go it alone. (Inaudible). The European Council on Foreign Relations has made the proposal that 13 European (inaudible) nations get together and act as a kind of consortium and deliver armoured vehicles together. What do you think about that proposal?\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\n\nSo, NATO Allies and partners have delivered armoured vehicles and Allies just at the meeting we had this week, I think it was Slovakia that announced that they were going to deliver more armoured vehicles and we are also delivered a lot of advanced weapon systems. And we see that this is making a huge difference on the battlefield every day. I will not go into the exact specifics of the types of weapons we are considering but Allies are constantly considering different types of weapons.\n\nWe are also in close dialogue with Ukraine. We had Minister Kuleba at the meeting in Bucharest, we meet in this what we call the Rammstein format led by the United States. And all in all, I think that what you have seen is an unprecedented level of military support.\n\nPresident Putin made two big strategic mistakes when he invaded Ukraine. The first big strategic mistake was to underestimate Ukraine, the courage, the commitment, the bravery of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Ukrainian people, Ukrainian political leadership. The other big strategic mistake he made was to underestimate NATO, NATO Allies and partners in our unity and our resolve to provide support to Ukraine.\n\nSo yes, I absolutely understand the need to discuss and to address the specific systems. But we have provided already a lot of advanced systems, including armoured vehicles, and thirdly\n\nOne more point on this is that it is important to discuss what kind of additional systems we should provide. And there is a constant discussion and dialogue with Ukraine on that. But I think as important as delivering new systems, it is extremely important to make sure that the systems we have already delivered function.\n\nBecause we have actually delivered a lot of systems. And they need as you know, they need ammunition. They need spare parts, they need maintenance. So one of the huge challenges to ensure that all the systems which are already in place are actually functioning as they should. That's a huge logistical challenge. I'm not saying not new systems doesn't matter. But I'm saying to ensure that all the systems which are in place function is extremely important. And we are focused on that too.\n\nModerator\n\nOkay. First, Bob Walter, then the gentlemen here, then the two gentlemen, five, six and Dr. (inaudible) with the last question. I guess, because we have to close the session. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, please make it short.\n\nQuestion\n\nOkay. Secretary General, thank you for your address. Robert Walter, I am from the European Security and Defence Association, and also president of Eurodefense, United Kingdom. We have seen the Ukraine crisis create unprecedented cooperation between NATO and the European Union, because there is a common threat assessment in both organizations. And I think, and I would like your comments on this, that this is an opportunity. You are originally from Norway, I am from the United Kingdom for the European nations in NATO to build a stronger European pillar, using the resources of the member states of both the European Union and of NATO and the EU institutions themselves. And put us beyond criticism, if by chance there should be a change of administration in the United States in two years time.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\n\nSo first of all, I strongly welcomed stronger NATO EU cooperation. And over the last years, we have been able to lift NATO EU cooperation up to unprecedented levels, on a wide range of issues from cyber, maritime, resilience and in many other areas we work together in in the Balkans, you have the NATO presence in Kosovo, we have the support in the EU diplomatic efforts. And also as you alluded to, of course, the way we work together in providing support to Ukraine demonstrates how strong and how important the NATO-EU cooperation is and this is something I have personally also strongly worked for all of my years as Secretary General. So that's obvious.\n\nThen I also welcome more EU efforts on defence, as long as that doesn't duplicate NATO efforts, because we need to realize that NATO remains the bedrock for European and transatlantic security. And if, as long as European efforts on defence means things like for instance, increased defence spending, any meaningful increased European efforts on defence has to come with increased defence spending.\n\nThere is one organization that has been calling for increased European defence spending for decades. And that is NATO. So of course, we welcome that, that Germany and other European Allies spend more on defence. Good. If it means that European Allies are providing more capabilities, more battle tanks, more ammunition, more readiness forces, also great. It's absolutely in line with what NATO has been asking for many years. And we see that Allies are spending more, European Allies are spending more, and they're also providing new capabilities, we strongly welcome that.\n\nAnd also, if European defence means that, for instance, you're addressing the fragmentation of the European defence industry, it's a great advantage for all of us. As you will, we all know, the United States that have very many battle tanks, one main type, in Europe, we have quite a few battle tanks, and seven different types. So of course, the cost per unit, there is no economy of scale, maintenance, spare parts, or education. All that becomes extremely difficult when we have this fragmentation. So all of these are extremely good initiatives when it comes to European defence efforts.\n\nWhat we must prevent is duplication and competition. So for instance, to have another intervention force, we have an intervention force, and that is the NATO Response Force.\n\nAnd every time Europe needs that force, we are there. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Kosovo. You have to remember that the Libya operation, that was not a NATO operation originally. It was a European initiative. And after some time, when they came to NATO, and asked us for help, and then we supported the Libya operation. So I'm only saying that we have an intervention force, we have a command structure, and we should do NATO command structure, NATO readiness force, so we should do nothing that is duplicating and competing with that.\n\nAnd then more fundamentally, we need to realise that 80% of NATO's defence spending is coming from non-EU Allies. So of course, we welcome the efforts of the EU members and I call on them to do more every day. But it represents 20%.\n\nAnd then, and then one more thing on this is that yes, of course, there may be elections in both Europe and in North America, where you elect people who are not enthusiastically in favour of NATO. That has happened before it may happen again. But if you're concerned about that, you should not do anything which is weakening the institutionalized bond between Europe and North America. If you reduce the transatlantic idea to a kind of bilateral personal relationship, then we are vulnerable. But if we have strong institutions and that institution is NATO, because that's the only truly transatlantic institution then we can weather the storms.\n\nThe reality is that yes, we had President Trump and there were questions asked. But NATO survived, we actually strengthened the presence of NATO troops in Europe over those years. So any indication that Europe can go alone, can just weaken the transatlantic bond. So I strongly believe in NATO, I strongly believe in Europe and North America working together. I don't believe in Europe alone as I don't believe in America alone. I believe in Europe and North America together in NATO. And we need to safeguard that. Thank you.\n\nQuestion\n\nCongratulations for your speech. I am Colonel (inaudible), Defence Attach from the Republic of Cyprus. And from my country, we strongly support this cooperation with Europe, for Ukraine. My question is, as we have occupation from an Ally, NATO Ally, Trkiye, that is a candidate country in Europe, 48 years now. Do you think that it's time to support Cyprus problem for the reunification of Cyprus after 48 years? Thank you.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\n\nSo we strongly support the UN and efforts to try to find a negotiated and peaceful solution. I think that's the only way to address the challenges and unsolved issues in Cyprus. And that's also why we welcome those efforts. We have had different initiatives. And I think that remains the only way to solve the challenges and the conflict in Cyprus.\n\nModerator\n\nThe gentleman, I think row five and six please. There's one and then you close the session.\n\nQuestion\n\nThank you, sir, very much for a very good speech [inaudible] from corporate defence and aerospace. I've spent about 40 years in the Norwegian armed forces and it's understandable that we're now focusing on the current and the mid-short term issues.\n\nBut what are your thoughts for a new security architecture in Europe, considering that, maybe overdramatizes it a little bit, but the one we have is actually in shambles, where the CFE and a lot of the other treaties basically have been pushed aside. And as some have commented on, both today and yesterday, we don't necessarily cooperate the way we used to, and what is then the future for us, thank you.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\n\nOne important element, part of a European security architecture is NATO. And if anything, the war in Ukraine has just highlighted, demonstrated the importance of maintaining NATO as a pillar of European security, with North America, with Canada, with the United States. We see all the support they provide to Ukraine, we see that NATO has been able to significantly increase its military presence in eastern part of the Alliance, to prevent escalation of the war.\n\nSo I'm fully aware of that NATO is not the whole European security architecture, because you have institutions as OSCE and so on. But an extremely important part of any meaningful European security architecture is NATO, and NATO is more vital and stronger, more agile than itd been for decades. Because the war didn't start in February this year. The war started in 2014. That was when Russia annexed Crimea, and actually started to control parts of eastern Donbass.\n\nSince then, NATO has underwe have implemented the biggest reinforcement of collective defence. The biggest adaptation of our Alliance since the end of the Cold War, with battlegroups in eastern part of the Alliance with increased defence spending, with higher readiness, and more US, North American presence.\n\nWe have a US led battle group in Poland, we have a Canadian led battle group in Latvia. So you have more North America and Europe now for many, many years.\n\nI say this, because sometimes you speak about European security architecture, something abstract, and something elsefor academics, so it's very good. But it's very much about NATO. And NATO is there more than we have seen for many decades.\n\nAnd then of course, there are also other elements, and that includes not least Russia, how to relate to Russia, and that has been shattered by the war in Ukraine.\n\nFor many years, NATO strived for a more constructive relationship with Russia, for dialogue with Russia. I was Prime Minister when President Putin and Medvedev attended NATO summits we had just came from Bucharest as I told you, when I was there at the summit in 2008, President Putin was there. In Lisbon, Medvedev attended. That world doesn't exist anymore. Because with the invasion of Ukraine, that whole idea of a meaningful dialogue with Russia is uncharted. Also, it has been smashed and destroyed by Russia.\n\nAt the same time, we need to maintain military lines of communications to prevent escalation, to prevent incidents. We saw the incident in Poland, we need to do whatever we can to have incidents accidents that cant spiral out of control. So we need major lines of communication.\n\nI see General Breedlove is here in the audience. He was active, speaking to Russian counterparts when he was SACEUR or the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO. And we need to have that lines of communications. And of course, we also need to continue to engage with Russia on issues like arms control.\n\nSo the one part, NATO is as strong as ever. The other part of the European security architecture, this cooperation with Russia, is not functioning. Russia has walked away from the meaningful dialogue, but we need a minimum of a contact, military lines of communications, and for instance, to address issues like arms control.\n\nModerator\n\nOkay, so closing question by Dr. [inaudible] please.\n\nQuestion\n\nI am representing the Federation of German Defence Industry and Security Industry. Secretary General, the question I have is regarding the Green Deal of the EU. The Green Deal has turned out to be a very powerful transformation agent for our societies. And it means that on the one hand, ministries have to become Climate Neutral, companies like our member companies have to become ESG, you have to get ESG conformity which we are really doing. However, we are producing weapons and our financial sector, categorizes weapons, even if they are in order to help our armed forces to fulfil their NATO tasks, tend to categorize those weapons as non-sustainable. What can NATO do in order to bridge this kind of gap?\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\n\nSo you're raising a very important issue. And that is that I have also the defence industry represented by you and others they have raised to me several times. We had the big conference in Rome, some time ago, I had meetings with a lot of defence executives, actually, in Brussels just a couple of weeks ago. And they raised exactly the same issue that they have problems with getting financing, investments, because they don't fulfil this ESG guidelines, and there also been some questions about the EU taxonomy.\n\nWe have engaged with the European Union, on those issues, raised our concerns, the European Union is now looking into it, working on it, and some actions have been taken to make it easier for the defence industry to get finance.\n\nThis is partly about government regulations. But it's also very much about what private financial companies decide themselves without any government regulations. So I think this is partly to address governments, we are doing that as an Alliance and the European Union, they are very much aware, and they're working on the issue to try to avoid that kind of, as I say, unintended effects.\n\nAnd we need to also to then address the financial sector. Because it is absolutely meaning there is no meaning in saying that we should make it harder, more difficult to invest in defence industry. We need those capabilities. Of course, it's always nicer to invest in health and infrastructure and education. But when there is a full-fledged war going on in Ukraine, the way to save life is to give them ammunition, to give them air defence. And that's the brutal reality, like it or not.\n\nIf you look at opinion polls, people understand this. They don't regard defence industry from NATO Allied countries as something which is not sustainable. The reality is that the only way to sustain peace is to invest in defence. And rest assured, we are working hard on that.\n\nAnd of course, we have seen a transition where the defence industry was state owned, then many of them have been more private owned. But of course, you cannot end up in a situation where the defence industry is not able to get private capital and then end all as state owned again. Because the private financial market has some idea of what is sustainable. So they just have to change the idea of what is sustainable and make it easy to invest in the defence industry.\n\nModerator\n\nMr. Secretary General, thank you very much indeed for your briefing and frank answers to the audience of the Berlin Security Conference and we wish you good luck and Godspeed for the Alliance ploughing forward and the cohesion of the Alliance. Thank you very much indeed.",

                "cc_text": "2:14 p.m. EST\n\nMR PRICE: Good afternoon, everyone.\n\nQUESTION: Afternoon.\n\nMR PRICE: All right. So we have one thing at the top, and then I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nThis morning, Secretary Blinken, Administrator Power, and White House Gender Policy Council Director Klein announced the release of the updated 2022 United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally. The updated strategy will direct an inclusive, locally led, and survivor-centered approach to prevent and respond to genderbased violence through U.S. foreign policy and assistance.\n\nA few key elements in the updated strategy are the intersectional and inclusive approaches to gender-based violence; the reinforcement of our commitment to doing this work in a survivor-centered, trauma-informed manner; and the integration of gender-based violence prevention and response as a strategic priority across our foreign policy goals.\n\nWe are grateful for the investment of time of over 450 individuals across 200 organizations who share their expertise to ensure this updated strategy to prevent and respond to gender-based violence is comprehensive and cemented in our U.S. foreign policy.\n\nWith that, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Great. Thanks, Ned. Happy Monday.\n\nMR PRICE: Happy Monday.\n\nQUESTION: I just want to see if we can get you on the record on updates, if there are any, on the two American citizens. The first, obviously, is Brittney Griner, and if theres anything you can add to what we know or what we heard from over the weekend, at least from the U.S. Government point of view. And then second is on Grant Wahl.\n\nMR PRICE: Sure. Let me start with the second. I think many of you know that we have been engaged on the passing of Grant Wahl since we first learned of it on Friday evening. Our ambassador in Doha, Timmy Davis, has been in close and nearly constant contact with the family of Grant Wahl. Ambassador Davis has been in, in turn, close and regular contact with senior officials from the department.\n\nWe worked nearly around the clock I should say our embassy worked nearly around the clock to help the family see to it that their wishes were fulfilled. And this morning, we did confirm that Grant Wahls remains and his belongings were repatriated to the United States just as an embassy officer had accompanied Grants remains in Doha, an officer an embassy consular officer accompanied his remains and his belongings on the flight back to the United States. At this point we will defer to the family to speak to the next steps. I know that they have spoken publicly to their wishes, and of course, we worked very closely with the family over the past 48 hours to help fulfill those wishes.\n\nWhen it comes to Brittney Griner, were not going to be in a position to offer much in the way of updates going forward. You heard from Ambassador Carstens and Brittney Griners representatives that she is indeed at Fort Sam Houston at the Joint Army Medical Center. It is both not for us to speak to updates from here out, but in a way, were not in a position to do so. The broader point is that the course of treatment that any returnee undergoes at Fort Sam Houston or elsewhere, it is not a preset prescribed set of steps. It is a conversation that experts will have with Brittney, with Cherelle, with other members and interested parties to determine whats in her best interests. And so whether that course of treatment lasts days or longer, that is not a question for us. That is up to Brittney Griner and to her, Im sure, loved ones.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, as it relates then to further American detainee wrongful detainees overseas, are there any updates at all on those?\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, our update, of course, is that we continue to work these cases dayin, dayout, around the clock. As you know, we often dont give status updates. It tends to be that our only update is when we have welcome news of a return. Thats what you heard late last week, last Thursday from us in the context of Brittney Griner. Its what youve heard from us a number of times over the course of this administration. So Im not in a position to offer updates into the status the particular status of other cases other than to note that we are regularly engaging with the families and loved ones of those Americans who are wrongfully detained around the world. We are regularly engaging with governments and representatives of countries that hold Americans in wrongful detention to do everything we can to see their release as soon a we can.\n\nQUESTION: Can I just follow up on that, then?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: So President Biden said this, and you guys have said this as well, that Russia is unfortunately treating Paul Whelan differently. So I understand you wouldnt speak to like what you guys do on this on a daily basis. But what are you guys going to do differently? What is the U.S. Government going to do differently to secure his release?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, look, we have made very clear our commitment to do everything we possibly can to see the release of wrongfully detained Americans released. And of course Paul Whelan does remain wrongfully detained in Russia. As in all cases, unfortunately, the other side gets a vote. The other side gets a veto. The other side has used that veto, unfortunately, when it comes to Paul Whelan.\n\nThey were the Russians have to date not been willing to negotiate seriously or constructively on Paul Whelans release because they have and had always treated him differently than Brittney Griner and other wrongful detainees because they do have the sham espionage charges attached to his case. Nevertheless, we are committed. We are going to be creative. We are going to be relentless in working with Paul Whelans family, his loved ones, and in turn with the Russians to do everything we can to see this case resolved as soon as we can.\n\nA couple points. We have now demonstrated on two separate occasions that we have an appropriate channel with the Russian Government that has repeatedly proved its utility. This is a channel that has been in existence since the two presidents met in Geneva in June of 2021. Of course, a lot has changed in the world and certainly in our bilateral relationship since then. But something that has not changed is the viability of this channel. And in fact, weve been able to demonstrate its effectiveness.\n\nSo we are going to continue to engage in a principled, consistent way with the appropriate Russian authorities to secure Pauls release. When Trevor Reed came home in April, we wished at the time for nothing more than that Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan could have been on that plane. When Brittney Griner came home late last week, we wished for nothing more at the time than that Paul Whelan could have been on that plane. We are determined that a plane will be dispatched to Russia before long to bring Paul Whelan home. Its a commitment weve made to his family. Its a commitment weve made to Paul.\n\nRoger Carstens has spoken to Paul Whelan; other senior officials in the government have spoken to Paul Whelan in the past couple days. Our message to Paul, our message to every American who is wrongfully detained is: Hang tight. Keep the faith. Well come to get you.\n\nQUESTION: Right. When you say Russians have not been willing to negotiate seriously on Paul Whelan, are we talking about a specific proposal that the United States Government has made regarding Paul Whelan since last Thursday that they havent entertained yet?\n\nMR PRICE: So Im not going to go\n\nQUESTION: Or are we talking about like general?\n\nMR PRICE: Im not going to go into the specific timeline. What I can say is that we have made very one well, one very famous proposal to the Russians, and I say \"famous\" because Secretary Blinken announced it from this podium in July. It was clear that the Russians were not going to move seriously or constructively on that particular proposal. So in the months, in the intervening months between July and last week, we have been in regular dialogue with the Russians to put forward alternatives, permutations, ideas, that could have resulted in the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.\n\nSecretary Blinken was very clear when he spoke of the substantial proposal, the initial substantial proposal that we put forward in July, that the proposal was for both Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner. It was made clear to us over the course of those intervening months that the Russians were at that point not in a position to negotiate seriously or constructively for Paul Whelan. But were going to keep at it.\n\nQUESTION: Last one on that one: since last Thursday this channel that you guys have established with the Russians, has there been any communication through that channel with the Russians about Paul Whelan or Marc Fogel or anyone else?\n\nMR PRICE: I am just not going to go into the specifics. And this was the same posture we took before Brittney Griner was released; it was the same posture we took before Trevor Reed was released in April. We dont do a play-by-play of our diplomacy and our negotiations, but I can assure you that we are committed to doing everything we can to see Paul Whelan returned to his loved ones.\n\nQUESTION: Recognizing you dont do a play-by-play, I just want to make sure I to get you to clarify your comment from a little while ago when you said, a plane will be dispatched to Russia to get Paul Whelan.\n\nMR PRICE: I was thank you thank you, Matt. Thank you, Matt. I was yes.\n\nQUESTION: Since neither of the previous two releases have involved sending a plane to Russia\n\nMR PRICE: Yes. Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: thats you didnt mean that, did you? You meant that\n\nMR PRICE: I do not expect I do not expect that we would be dispatching a plane from the United States to Russia. There are obviously ways to effect repatriations with\n\nQUESTION: Yeah. No, I understand. But, I mean, when you say something like that, it can it can give people the idea that things are advanced enough that youre talking about actually sending a plane directly into Russia.\n\nMR PRICE: Thank you for the opportunity to clarify.\n\nQUESTION: May I ask a question differently?\n\nMR PRICE: Anything else on this before we\n\nQUESTION: Just one more quick question on this.\n\nMR PRICE: Then Alex, and then Ill go to\n\nQUESTION: Russian deputy foreign minister claims that U.S. is not being constructive in Istanbul talks. Is there anything specific at Istanbul talks that we need to know about? I notice that hes using present tense. Is there an ongoing dialogue?\n\nMR PRICE: We did confirm that last week a senior official from the department did meet with the Russian counterparts in Turkey to discuss bilateral issues between the United States and the Russian Federation. We were very clear; in fact, we were probably clearer about what was not on the table than what was on the table. This was not about strategic stability. This was not about Ukraine, of course. This was not about wrongfully detained American citizens., This was about a pretty narrow set of bilateral issues bilateral irritants, you might call them, including staffing levels at our embassies, for example.\n\nSo were not going to go into details, but we believe its important to have lines of communication with the Russian Federation in times of tension but especially in times of in times of conflict. Thats what this is about. We have multiple avenues to communicate with the Russians. Weve already talked about two of them in the course of this briefing. Were determined to do everything we can to maintain that dialogue and to pursue our interests.\n\nKylie.\n\nQUESTION: Talked about a single meeting in Istanbul, or theres an ongoing\n\nMR PRICE: The our senior official has returned to Washington.\n\nKylie.\n\nQUESTION: And just Im just has the U.S. been explicit with Russia about there being a cost or consequence if Viktor Bout does go ahead and provide support, physical or logistical, in any way to the ongoing war in Ukraine? I ask because over the weekend he said that he wholeheartedly supports the war and he would volunteer if he could.\n\nMR PRICE: Im not going to weigh in on those comments. The only thing I will say, Kylie, is that weve been clear in any different contexts, any number of contexts, including with the Russians, that we have a number of tools at our disposal to counter the range of threats and challenges that the Russian Federation poses, that Russian individuals might potentially pose, or that individuals in Russia might pose to the United States. We wont hesitate to use tools as appropriate to go after anyone who poses a threat to the United States or our interests.\n\nQUESTION: So keeping him from providing support to the Ukraine war wasnt any sort of pre-negotiated part of this prisoner swap?\n\nMR PRICE: Im just not going to go into the specific talks other than to say what is well known by now, that ultimately we arrived at a formulation that saw a swap involving the release of Brittney Griner in return for the release of Viktor Bout.\n\nAnything else on this before we move on? Sure.\n\nQUESTION: A quick question. So there was a report on Friday that Russia wanted to see Vadim Krasikov released in Germany in exchange for Whelan. Can you confirm it? And if yes, if the U.S. tried to work with German partners on this, are ready to continue working on the issue?\n\nMR PRICE: The only thing I can confirm is what you said, that there was such a report. Im not in a position to speak to the veracity of that specific report. What I will say is that were going to leave the mechanics of that dialogue and diplomacy to the appropriate channel. But Ill reiterate what Ive said, that the Russians have not yet been in a position to negotiate constructively or seriously regarding Paul Whelan because they have consistently treated him differently than other American wrongful detainees, including Trevor Reed, most recently including Brittney Griner. That is not going to deter us in any way whatsoever. We are going to be committed, we are going to be creative, and were going to be relentless in our efforts to see Paul Whelan released.\n\nAnything else on Russia-Ukraine? Okay, Nazira.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Two question, Ned. One about two days attack in Kabul, and number two about theres a former President Karzai meeting with Tom West. Any update? Because Afghan people should know that United States know are involved about the president, former President Karzai have Tom West meeting.\n\nMR PRICE: So first on the attack today in Kabul. Weve seen these reports, the reports of violence, reports potentially of deaths and casualties. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the use of violence against innocent civilians. The Afghan people have been subjected to levels of violence for that are far too high for far too long, and we condemn unequivocally what has happened today.\n\nObviously, these reports are fresh out of Kabul. The attack appears to bear some of the hallmarks of ISIS-K, some of the brutal tactics that this especially brutal group has used to perpetrate attacks against the people of Afghanistan. We continue to call on the Taliban to live up to the commitments that they have made to the international community, to the United States bilaterally in some cases, but most importantly to the commitments that they have to their own people. And one of those commitments is to provide a society that is free from this sort of terrorist violence. So well continue to watch very closely and we continue to stand with the Afghan people who are suffering needlessly as a result of these levels of terrorist violence.\n\nTo your second question, Special Representative for Afghanistan Tom West was on travel last week. He traveled to Japan, he traveled to India, he traveled to the UAE to meet with government counterparts, media and civil society, business leaders, and other communities and communities and individuals with ties to Afghanistan.\n\nIn Dubai and Abu Dhabi when he was in the UAE, Tom West met with Afghan business leaders to discuss the need for improved financial and monetary policies to benefit the Afghan people and with political leaders. And that includes, as you referenced, Hamid Karzai and former Balkh Governor Atta.\n\nIn Indonesia and I should mention that Rina Amiri was also on travel last week as well. Rina Amiri was in Indonesia, Switzerland, and Turkey, where she met with Afghan women and civil society leaders to hear their perspectives and to amplify the plea of the Afghan people for the Taliban to respect the rights of women, girls, and other at-risk communities, and to initiate an inclusive national dialogue. We do welcome the Talibans decision to allow former President Karzai to travel to the UAE. We saw that as a positive step. We want to engage with representatives of the Afghan people and a broad range of representatives of the Afghan people.\n\nIn all of their commitments, Tom West and Rina Amiri have urged the international community to return excuse me, to continue to advocate for the return of girls to secondary school and women to work. We know that is absolutely indispensable to Afghanistans security, to its stability, and to its prosperity as well.\n\nQUESTION: Who pick for Hamid Karzai in Saudi? United States is involved about that, or just Taliban pick Hamid Karzai as a key member to go and make a negotiation here?\n\nMR PRICE: We meet with a range of Afghan stakeholders, with a range of voices. It was not only Hamid Karzai that Tom West met with, but he met with another representative of the Afghan people while he was there. This is something that he does regularly, that Rina Amiri does regularly, that others here do regularly as well.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Yes, sir.\n\nQUESTION: Jalil Afridi from The Frontier Post. Im here after two years because State Department hadnt renewed foreign journalist credentials.\n\nMR PRICE: Welcome back.\n\nQUESTION: But I was regularly here since Mr. Kirby was here, and its very good to see you. Ive been hearing it online.\n\nSo my first question is that just with regard to Afghanistan and inter-relating it to my professional visa, so State Department took two years for decades-old journalist to renew their credential. Are you still satisfied that the State Department did a good job with the thousand of Afghans that came here? Do you still believe that their vetting process was done well?\n\nAnd because Peter had had this question in the White House as well, about Homeland Security publishing a report that these the vetting process was not done well, and although the poor man had denied and rejected that report that it was not fact. But are you guys still satisfied that the vetting process was done well? And is this administration going to take the responsibility if those who came in those two years do something, God forbid, in future? Will this administration take the responsibility?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, let me just put a finer point on one part of your question. This is a process that is ongoing. Our commitment to the people of Afghanistan does not have an expiration date attached to it. You may be referring to the 120-plus, 124,000 individuals whom the United States Government helped to evacuate from Afghanistan during the process of the military withdrawal. That is one finite set of individuals. But our commitment to American citizens, to lawful permanent residents, and more to your question to Afghans who have partnered with us over the course of the past over the course of the preceding 20 years, that commitment is ongoing.\n\nAnd in fact, since September 1st of 2021, now for some 15 or so months, we have continued to make good on that commitment by facilitating the departure from Afghanistan of those American citizens, those lawful permanent residents, those partners of ours over the course of that 20-year military engagement, who have chosen to leave. And of course, our first priority is to Americans, to LPRs, and to their immediate family members. But thousands of Afghans have been transited out of Afghanistan under the auspices of the U.S. Government since September 1st of last year when that formal evacuation process came to an end, and that will continue to happen going forward.\n\nAs part of that process for our Afghan partners, whether it is the processing of those who were welcome here under Operation Allies Rescue, under Operation Allies Welcome as it subsequently became known, or as part of the SIV processing again, to your question, there is an extensive vetting process. It is a process that involves not only this building; it involves our Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Intelligence Community more broadly, pulling upon every available source of information to make sure that someone is appropriate for resettlement here in the United States.\n\nThis is a process that has been honed over the course of many, many years now, and because of the inclusive, comprehensive nature of the vetting process it is not always a quick process. We attempt to see it completed just as quickly as possible, but it is a thorough process in which we have confidence and the American people should have confidence.\n\nQUESTION: Just one more question, although I do have contradiction about this, because State Department officials and Pakistani officials off the record have said that they have doubts about the vetting process, but just moving onto one more question.\n\nYou guys, the State Department and the White House, has any collaboration with each other with regard to because as you know, Secretary Blinken and Joe Biden, President Joe Biden, are two individuals that even their opponents agree on their foreign policy strength, that there is this is one of their strengths. How about the media? Do you and theres a White House press, Ms. Karine. Do you guys have any, like, sharing of information about international journalists and how to promote the U.S. policy abroad, or these things are not discussed between you two?\n\nMR PRICE: Could you clarify your question? Do you mean\n\nQUESTION: Basically what Im saying does the State Department informs the White House press secretary about the foreign journalists working in Washington, D.C., and to engage them or to at least when they come to press conferences just to give a small example, like, for example, if Matt was in Pakistan presidency for three months, going to press briefing and not getting an opportunity to ask a question.\n\nMR PRICE: I see.\n\nQUESTION: Would that look any awkward? Like, does Ms. Karine do you, like, discuss at all with them? Because, I mean, Im just coming to Pakistan, to be honest with you. Question is, like, in last few months, the way Mr. Donald Lu has become popular in Pakistan I mean, even president has become that popular. So, like, do you tell Karine that if a Pakistani journalist is there, at least give them an opportunity to ask a question?\n\nMR PRICE: I understand. We have a regular discussion and dialogue with our White House counterparts. They of course know the indispensability of foreign journalists to our broader foreign policy mission. Of course, there are foreign journalists in this room every day, there are foreign journalists in the White House press briefing room every day, and I know how much our White House colleagues value the White Houses own foreign correspondents association and how valuable, in turn, having that association is, because our messages need to be understood and digested not only in this country but around the world. And in order to do that, I understand I know my colleague at the White House understands as well that we need to be able to speak to people like you, people who are disseminating these messages well beyond our national borders.\n\nLeon.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, sir.\n\nQUESTION: Hi, Ned. I would like to move on to the U.S.-Africa summit actually, to the margins of that summit. There are many leaders invited, including the ones from Rwanda and the DRC this against a backdrop of renewed fighting in the eastern Congo and pressure on Rwanda and its support of the presumably support of the M23 rebels. I was just wondering if the Secretary would seize the opportunity that he has here with the two leaders being here or going to be here to maybe get them together, broker some sort of discussion, and because the obviously the opportunity is right in front of him.\n\nMR PRICE: Yeah, there are a number of opportunities that the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit will present in the coming days. Some of them have to do with peace and security on the continent. That, of course, will be a topic of discussion in many different fora over the next few days. As you know, this is a conflict and a set of tensions that Secretary Blinken has become personally invested in traveled to Rwanda and the DRC in August as tensions were flaring in an effort to engage the leaders of both countries, to urge a de-escalation and to urge steps that would put an end to these hostilities.\n\nHes continued to be personally engaged with counterparts in both countries, this week, of course, and weve continued to see levels of violence that are of concern. We remain deeply concerned by developments in the eastern DRC, particularly the renewed M23/FARDC hostilities. These hostilities really resumed in earnest in October and theyve continued since. Weve been deeply troubled by reports of killings of civilian areas under M23 control.\n\nWe just as we did when we were in the region, as weve done since that travel, weve urged all armed groups to cease hostilities. Weve called for a swift and thorough investigation of and accountability for those responsible for these reports of atrocities. And we support the Africanled mediation efforts to address the regional tensions in eastern DRC. The East African Community, Kenya, Angola have played an important role in all of this. We spoke to that role when we were in the region in the late summer, but all three have continued to engage with Rwanda and the DRC.\n\nWe urge implementation of the commitments that came forward after the November meeting in Luanda. There was a communique that was put forward following that meeting. Those commitments include a cessation of hostilities, the M23s withdrawal, and an end to state sponsor to armed groups, as well as condemnation of hate speech and the resumption of consultations between the DRC Government and domestic armed groups through that Nairobi process. So we continue to urge the DRC and Rwanda to work with one another, to work constructively with their neighbors, namely Kenya, Angola, and through the East African Community, to fulfill those commitments that were put forward.\n\nQUESTION: But there will be no three-way meeting or anything like that (inaudible)?\n\nMR PRICE: I couldnt speak at this point to any meetings that may be on the schedule, but I can assure you that tensions in the eastern DRC will be on the agenda.\n\nQUESTION: Can we stay on the Africa summit?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Im wondering if Secretary Blinken in his meetings will raise any concerns about Chinese lending and investment in the region, and if yes, what will be the message, basically.\n\nMR PRICE: Humeyra, youve traveled with us and heard us long enough to know that we tend not to speak in relation to any other country. We tend to have conversations with countries that are about the United States and what we can do, and, in some cases, what our comparative advantage is. In the Africa strategy speech that the Secretary laid out to the continent and to the world when we were in South Africa several months ago, the Secretary made the point that the United States is ready, willing, and able to be the partner of first resort for the countries across the continent.\n\nWe recognize the vibrancy, the energy, the opportunity that is presented on the continent, and thats not opportunity for us; it is opportunity for the countries of Africa to achieve with us. And that is really what we mean when we say partnership. We are not looking for a relationship that is transactional, thats extractive, that is burdensome, or leaves country in a leaves various countries in a more fragile, poorer state after a deal is signed.\n\nQUESTION: Is that a characterization for how you guys see Chinese investment in the region?\n\nMR PRICE: It is a characterization of what were not looking for. What were looking for is true, genuine partnership with the countries of Africa, a partnership that will allow us to unlock the potential, whether its through trade and investment, whether its through people-to-people ties, whether its through deepening diplomatic initiatives to advance our interests and the interests of the countries on the continent.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, but its no doubt that China has expanded its footprint in that across that continent. So, I mean, let me ask it differently: Is this like a I mean, do you see this as an opportunity for the U.S. to deepen its ties with the countries there?\n\nMR PRICE: Of course. Of course. This is this is what the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit is all about. At the first U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in 2014, we invited heads of state and government to come to Washington to begin this conversation as a continent. Now some eight years later, this is another important opportunity for Africa to come to the United States as a continent to discuss areas where individual countries bilaterally, groupings of countries multilaterally, or the continent itself, whether through the AU or other ad hoc groupings, can work closely with the United States.\n\nWe want to use the summit to deepen that partnership. We think weve made good headway over the course of the past few years during this administration, but theres nothing like face-to-face diplomacy; theres nothing like having the relevant leaders from across the continent in the United States for these discussions.\n\nQUESTION: Can I\n\nMR PRICE: Yes, Janne.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Can I follow up Chinese issues there? Chineses President Xi Jinping declared that crude oil purchase will be made in the Chinese money, yuan. What is the U.S. position of the hegemonic competition with the dollar as China declared internationalization of the yuan?\n\nMR PRICE: What was sorry, what was the last part of your question, Janne?\n\nQUESTION: What is the U.S. position on the hegemonic competition with the dollar as China declared the internationalization of the yuan, the Chinese money?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, it is just a fact that business transactions around the world oftentimes are denominated in U.S. dollars. I wouldnt necessarily call that hegemonic. I would call that a consequence of time and convenience and history.\n\nI think the underlying point of your question is something that we can offer a bit more on because you seem to be referencing Chinese purchases of Russian oil, if I if I heard correctly. Weve worked with countries around the world, of course, to do what we can to hold Russia to account for the brutal war of aggression that its waging against the people and the country of Ukraine. As part of that, we have sought to limit the revenue-making ability of the Kremlin. Weve put in place a number of steps, including on December 5th, a week ago now, putting into place the price cap on the export of seaborne Russian oil.\n\nWe do not think that countries should be deepening their economic ties with Russia at a time of its brutal aggression against the people of Ukraine. Weve put in place this oil cap so that global energy markets continue can continue to be stable, can continue to be supplied without providing the Russian Federation the revenue that it would otherwise accrue and in turn use for its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nNow, a number of countries have agreed to comply with this oil cap, but even for countries that are not formally part of the oil cap, the cap has the effect of depressing the price of Russian oil. Even before it went into effect, the price of Russian oil was reduced as a result of the promise of the oil cap. Markets, of course, are forward-looking. As soon as the oil cap plans to institute it were announced, that had implications on the price of Russian oil.\n\nSo whether countries are formally part of the price cap or not, we encourage them to take advantage of the implications of the price cap when it comes to the price of Russian oil, which in turn will deprive the Russians of revenue they would otherwise accrue from those sales.\n\nQUESTION: One more question now, and just turn to Secretary for East Asia and Indo-Pacific Kritenbrink visited China and South Korea and Japan. How would you describe your background over these three countries at this time? And during this visit to South Korea, will you discuss South Korea electric vehicles? Electric vehicles.\n\nMR PRICE: Electric vehicles.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, IRAs.\n\nMR PRICE: So we did announce last week that Assistant Secretary Kritenbrink accompanied by the Senior Director for China and Taiwan Laura Rosenberger and our Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for China and Taiwan excuse me, Deputy Assistant Secretary for China and Taiwan Rick Waters did travel to would travel to the PRC.\n\nThey met with PRC Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng in Langfang on December 11th and 12th. They went there for a number of reasons, in part to follow up on the two presidents the conversation the two presidents had in Bali in November, but they also discussed preparations for Secretary Blinkens own travel to the PRC early next year.\n\nThe talks were candid. They were substantive. Assistant Secretary Kritenbrink and Senior Director Rosenberger made clear that the United States would continue to compete vigorously, stand up for U.S. interests and values, defend the rules-based international order, and coordinate closely with allies and partners. Those are the points that we make in all of our engagements with senior PRC officials.\n\nThey also emphasized the importance we place on bringing home U.S. citizens who are wrongfully detained or who may be subject to exit bans, noting that its a personal priority for the President, for the Secretary of State as well.\n\nThey exchanged views on key regional and global issues, including Russias aggression in Ukraine and the threat to regional security and stability that the DPRK poses as well.\n\nThey also explored potential avenues for cooperation where our interests do intersect. That includes on challenges such as climate change, health security, global macroeconomic stability, and global food security as well.\n\nAfter the meetings in China, the Assistant Secretary and Senior Director Rosenberger, they traveled to Seoul and Tokyo for consultations on a range of regional and bilateral issues. They were there from December 12th through the 14th.\n\nQUESTION: Last one. Last one, excuse me. Why doesnt the United States impose sanctions on China and Russian individual entities to help North Korea?\n\nMR PRICE: Why\n\nQUESTION: Why China and Russia is not sanctioned? I mean additional sanctions regarding\n\nMR PRICE: Well, Janne, were always looking for individuals who would be appropriate to sanction under our various authorities, including those authorities that are targeted at the DPRKs ballistic missile program, its nuclear weapons program, its WMD program more broadly. If there are individuals who are appropriate for the use of sanctions, we wont hesitate to do that. We are we have made very clear that we will continue to hold the DPRK to account for its threat to stability and security in Northeast Asia and potentially well beyond.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. To follow up Secretary Blinkens visit to China, logistically could you explain why the meetings in Langfang instead of Beijing?\n\nMR PRICE: I would need to refer to you to PRC authorities for that.\n\nQUESTION: And regarding the talks, have they talked the recent arm sales to Taiwan?\n\nMR PRICE: Did they discuss recent arms sales to Taiwan?\n\nQUESTION: Yeah.\n\nMR PRICE: Beyond the readout that I just provided, Im not in a position to go beyond that. But in every senior-level engagement with the PRC, we make very clear that we continue to uphold, to respect our \"one-China\" policy and the elements that undergird it, as we continue to fulfill the requirements that are put forward in the Taiwan Relations Act.\n\nQUESTION: And when you talk about Secretary Blinkens visit to China early next year, are we talking about January or February?\n\nMR PRICE: At this point, were just in a position to say early next year. I think were at the preliminary stages of scheduling the visit, so I wouldnt want to get ahead of where we are.\n\nQUESTION: And will the COVID outbreak in China have any impact on this trip planned to China?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, we are planning this. We are at the early stages of planning this with the assistant secretarys travel and Laura Rosenbergers travel. Weve had face-to-face discussions regarding this, but we do look forward to the opportunity to continue the face-to-face conversation that President Biden had with President Xi in Bali last month when Secretary Blinken does travel to China early next year.\n\nQUESTION: Which kind of interactions between this building and China will take place before Secretary Blinkens visit?\n\nMR PRICE: There is always a range of preparatory discussions before any senior-level travel anywhere. I would hazard to guess that those discussions may be even more intensive in the run-up to Secretary Blinkens travel to the PRC because this will be the first senior-level travel during this administration to the PRC and one of the first senior-level interlocutors to travel to Beijing since the outbreak of COVID in early 2020.\n\nSo there is a lot of preparations to do. Were in the early stages of that. And as soon as we have more to announce regarding the details of the travel, we will.\n\nLaura.\n\nQUESTION: Regarding COP15, I wonder if 30 by 30 does the administration consider that a floor or a target that is ambitious? Can is there more we can do?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, we are\n\nQUESTION: And I have another question.\n\nMR PRICE: We are always looking at what more we can potentially do when it comes to COP15. Of course, it does present an opportunity to advance international efforts to save nature, to reverse and potentially even restore unprecedented global loss of biodiversity, and to protect nature for generations to come. We look at COP15 as the potential to be a turning point when it comes to these important issues.\n\nI think you were on the call this morning when our Special Envoy and Assistant Secretary Monica Medina discussed her upcoming travel to COP15 and the goals we have for that. Not only do we set a high standard for ourselves, but we believe that by demonstrating our own ambition when it comes to these issues climate, biological diversity we in turn can be a catalyst for other countries to do the same.\n\nAnd we hope COP15 is an opportunity for countries to come with ambitious targets and commitments in hand, and potentially even to leave COP15 with even more ambitious commitments in hand. But well have more to say about all of this as it gets underway.\n\nQUESTION: As a follow-up, is there any chance that some of the biodiversity ambitions that we have could get into talks with, say, China or as an area where we have could have agreement?\n\nMR PRICE: Climate, shared transnational challenges like this, are absolutely areas where our interests intersect. You heard from us for youve heard from us consistently that when the United States and the PRC arent able to cooperate effectively or even discuss effectively these transnational challenges, it doesnt just hold the United States back, it doesnt just hold China back, but it presents a challenge to the entire international community.\n\nCountries around the world expect the United States and China to work constructively to see where we can potentially cooperate when it comes to these transnational climates like biodiversity, like climate, like global health, like the threat from narcotics and cooperation when it comes to counter-narcotics. That is something that we are determined to do. One of the reasons President Biden thought it so important to meet with President Xi in Bali, to now have a number of conversations with President Xi during the course of this administration, is to explore, is to test the proposition that we can deepen cooperation with the PRC in areas that are in our mutual interests. And its undeniable that this is one of them.\n\nSaid.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. The Palestinian issue. A human rights group called on the State Department to invoke the Leahy Law on a battalion called Netzah Yehuda. Its a notorious battalion. Theyre the one in whose custody last year an American citizen died, Omar Assad. I wonder if you have any comment on that. And would, actually, the department recommend such a\n\nMR PRICE: Well, Said, consistent with the Leahy Law, which by the way is just an important legacy, one of the many important legacies, of Senator Leahy, something that I think rightly carries\n\nQUESTION: Oh, yeah.\n\nMR PRICE: Of course.\n\nQUESTION: Of course.\n\nMR PRICE: Of course. But just to herald him and to herald it, it is something we take very seriously. All security force units that are nominated to receive assistance from the department, including training, are vetted according to the Leahy Law. And we manage our security relationships around the world in the context of human rights and the rule of law and in accordance with U.S. legislation, including in this case with the Leahy vetting laws. Well not waver from supporting efforts aimed at promoting respect for human rights or the rule of law, for accountability, for justice, for reconciliation as well.\n\nQUESTION: Speaking of Omar Assad, its been 11 months today, as a matter of fact. Are you anywhere near knowing what really happened?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, of course Omar Assad was an American citizen. Our thoughts continue to be with his family, with his loved ones now nearly a year after his death. Weve stated this multiple times now. But we were and are extremely concerned about the circumstances surrounding his death, and we urge the swift conclusion into the ongoing criminal investigation. We do note the statement on the report of the IDF commanders inquiry into the cause and its findings, including the determination that, quote, \"the incident showed a clear lapse of moral judgment,\" and a failure to protect, quote, \"the sanctity of any human life,\" and as well as the and we also note that disciplinary action is being taken against three commanders of the unit involved in the incident, the unit at the heart of your question.\n\nQUESTION: And one last question. Today a young Palestinian girl, 16 years old, was shot and killed on the roof of her house by another notorious group. Theyre the ones theyre called Mistaarvim. They dress like local Arabs and so on, and they go about hunting the Palestinians. I wonder if you have any comment on this. Should there be an investigation into this thing? Should people that have committed this crime be held accountable?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, similarly, Said, we do express our profound condolences to the family of Jana Zakarneh, the young teenage girl who was killed. This it is a tragic incident. Its a heartbreaking incident any time you hear of a civilian being killed in these types of operations. We understand the IDF is undertaking an investigation into what happened. We hope to see accountability in this case. I did note that outgoing Prime Minister Lapid did offer his condolences to the family of Jana Zakarneh, and we note that that her tragic death comes in the context of the escalating violence in the West Bank that weve noted and lamented for some time now.\n\nIt is this alarming increase in Palestinian and Israeli deaths and injuries, including injuries to numerous children and now the death of a young Palestinian teenager we reiterate the need for all parties to take steps to de-escalate the situation. Its vital that the parties themselves take urgent action to prevent even greater loss of life.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: I have a question about the president of Turkey. Im sure you may know that he threatened, again, Greek people in Greece. He said that his missiles will attack Athens. And I wanted to know if you have any comment since this is the worst threat ever coming from Erdoan against Greece.\n\nMR PRICE: Well, look, we regret this escalation of provocative statements. It is especially regrettable at a time when unity and cooperation is needed most among our own NATO Allies. We urge all of our allies to avoid threats and provocative rhetoric. All that an escalation of rhetoric will do is to is to raise tensions and to distract us from the unity of purpose, the unity of purpose that we need to confront any number of challenges, not the least of which, of course, is the threat that the Alliance potentially faces from Russia, and of course the ongoing active threat that the people of Ukraine face from Russian aggression.\n\nQUESTION: I have another question. Do you have anything to tell us about this scandal, the European parliament and the accusations that Qatar paid thousand of euros to some parliamentarians there?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, were closely monitoring developments in this case. Were closely monitoring the developments of the corruption investigation into current and former EU officials. Well continue to watch how this unfolds. But for comment, wed need to refer you to Belgium and to the EU as well.\n\nDylan.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, so you obviously spoke about the death of Grant Wahl earlier and his remains being returned to the U.S. But what about the circumstances surrounding his death? I mean, his brother said that he had been receiving death threats. His brother also said he didnt believe he died from bronchitis and that hes his quote was \"legitimately suspicious\" about what may have happened. And his brother also said that there were NYC police in Qatar looking into the situation. So I guess do you can you speak to what the U.S. is doing to look into the situation, how theyll hold Qatar accountable for being transparent and letting everybody know what happened there? And do you share that legitimate suspicion that his brothers said he has?\n\nMR PRICE: When it comes to the New York Police Department, Ill need to refer you to them to for anything they may be undertaking. But I would note that NYPD has had a liaison officer in Qatar as a normal course of business.\n\nWhen it comes to the tragic death of Grant Wahl, what I can say is that his remains were repatriated today. The family has spoken to the fact that he will his remains will undergo an autopsy in this country. Its my understanding that his remains are now in the possession of the New York City medical examiner.\n\nWhat I can also say is that we have seen no indication of foul play or anything nefarious at this point. We did receive excellent cooperation from our Qatari partners. As soon as we learned of Grant Wahls passing, our ambassador, as I mentioned before, was in regular contact with senior officials in the Qatari Government in an effort to see to it that we were in a position to fulfill the wishes of the families as expeditiously as possible. Our Qatari partners were cooperative, they were responsive, and as a result, Grant Wahl and his his remains and his possessions have been repatriated as of earlier this morning.\n\nQUESTION: May I ask a Syria question?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Today, the Turkish foreign minister, avuolu, acknowledged that there are talks between Syrian intelligence and Turkish intelligence to discuss ways and means to returning Syrian refugees. So my question to you: Do you feel that the conditions are there for the Syrian refugees to go back? Thats one.\n\nAnd second, he also said during some a parliamentarian session that theres all kinds of talks between Syria and Turkey on issues of terrorism and other issues. So just your comment.\n\nMR PRICE: These are these are much better questions for Turkey. We very much commend Turkey for its role in helping to provide safe haven to so many Syrians who have been forced to flee from their homes, from their communities over the course of the now more than a decade of civil war within Syria. We welcome everything Turkey has contributed to the humanitarian response that countries throughout the region have provided.\n\nOf course, Syria now is there continue to be a number of dangers and risks posed throughout the country. So we continue to work very closely with Turkey, with our partners on the ground as well to see to it that the progress that we have been able in the context of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS has made, in recent years especially, the progress against ISIS, against Daesh to see to it that that progress is not reversed and to see to it that the momentum we have that could one day see many more Syrians return to their homeland to see to it that that momentum is maintained.\n\nQUESTION: So is it still your feeling that conditions are not such where they are actually can allow for the return of Syrian refugees?\n\nMR PRICE: This is not a question for the United States. This is a question for Turkey when it comes to\n\nQUESTION: Well, the reason I ask this is because you guys said that before. You said that you believe the conditions are not anywhere near ripe for the return of refugees. But maybe the war has ebbed a little bit to allow for that.\n\nMR PRICE: Of course, weve seen progress against Daesh, but there continues to be levels of violence in the civil war, the civil war thats roiled the country for more than a decade now. And we continue to commend all of the countries in the region Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, others that have opened their arms and opened their borders to those fleeing violence from the civil war and from the threat of terrorism in Syria.\n\nAlex.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. A couple of questions on the region, starting from Iran. May I get a reaction to Iran today executing second prisoner detained during the protests? His name was Majidreza Rahnavard. Do you have any leverage on Iran to prevent them from conducting these executions?\n\nMR PRICE: So first, when it comes to the more horrific news coming out of Iran, we know that Majidreza Rahnavard is the Islamic Republics latest victim. He was swiftly executed after what can only be described as a sham trial. We understand that he was also executed publicly; he was hanged in public. The regime has rounded up and detained thousands of people for their involvement in these protests. Many of them now face harsh sentences, including the death penalty and sham trials that lack any due process. We denounce this draconian treatment in the strongest terms.\n\nThese harsh sentences and now the first public execution, at least, are meant to intimidate Irans people. They are meant to suppress dissent. And they simply just underscore how much Irans leadership actually fears its own people. As Irans leadership continues its violent crackdown on peaceful protesters, they should know that the United States is watching, but more importantly the world is watching, and well continue to coordinate with our allies and partners around the world to confront Irans human rights abuses.\n\nTo the second part of your question, Alex, we have a range of authorities. We have exercised many of those authorities already in the context of the violent crackdown on the protests on the part of the Iranian people, the efforts of the Iranian regime to suppress these peaceful protests, to cut off the Iranian peoples access to the outside world, their ability to communicate with one another. Weve used our human rights authorities, including in the tranche of sanctions that we spoke to last week, on in advance of Human Rights Day, to hold accountable those who are responsible for this brutal crackdown.\n\nQUESTION: If you talk to Iranian protesters, they always have concerns that Iranian Governments narrative is still able to find its way to Washington. They talk about lobbying groups. I dont want to name the names, but I also know that this might go beyond your payroll, but is it something you guys are worried about, that Irani lobbying groups are still roaming around and pushing their narratives?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, our Department of Justice, of course, oversees a program that sees to it that agents of a foreign power are registered as such, so Id refer you to the Department of Justice for questions pertaining to domestic activity in this country. But it is of course a concern to the United States, the ability of Iran to project repression beyond its borders, something we call transnational repression. We have taken note of the regimes efforts to pursue its critics well beyond its borders, including, in some cases, here in the United States. That, of course, is of great concern to us and something we take very seriously.\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nLet me move around, just because were running out of time.\n\nQUESTION: One more question just one more final question on Azerbaijan-Armenia. Im sure you have seen media reports that theres a tension building up involving the corridor between Azerbaijan and Armenia. I dont want to get into rabbit hole of who started what, he said, she said, but my question is: We have seen Putin calling two sides talking, Western Europeans express their concerns where is the U.S. at this point? Are you able to keep your eyes on the ball?\n\nMR PRICE: I think we have. We have consistently focused on this challenge, on the need to de-escalate tensions, on the need to set these two countries on the path to a lasting, comprehensive settlement. We, of course, brought the two countries together at the foreign minister level here in Washington. We did that in New York on the margins of the UN General Assembly. And Phil Reeker, our senior advisor, has been actively engaged with officials in both countries to see to it that we are doing everything we can and, most importantly, that these two countries are doing everything they can to see to it that these tensions are de-escalated.\n\nTake a couple final questions. Yes, in go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: The administration has stated support for African Union membership in the G20. Do you have any background on that? Why now? Is it because of the summit here in Washington, or is there more can you talk to a little bit more on that?\n\nMR PRICE: So this is something that the President will speak to during the course of the Africa Leaders Summit, but we believe, in short, that its past time for Africa to have a permanent seat at the table in international organizations and initiatives. We need more African voices in international conversation, including conversations that pertain to the global economy, democracy and governments governance, climate change, global health essentially every transnational challenge and opportunity that we face.\n\nAnd the President in making the statement is going to be following through on his commitments and listening to our African partners regarding what it is that they want and what they seek. This announcement builds on the strategy that Secretary Blinken laid out in South Africa over the summer. It also responds to requests from the AU president and South Africa, the only African G20 member at the present.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: I actually have a question about the meeting in Istanbul between Russian and U.S. officials. Are there any agreements following the meeting? This is my first question. And second question: Do you know of any meetings, similar meetings, being planned at the moment in the future?\n\nMR PRICE: So Im not in a position to speak to any potential future engagements, except to say that we believe in the value of such engagements because we believe in the need to maintain open channels of communication. These channels are important at all times, but theyre especially important in times of tension, and certainly in terms of times of conflict, as were seeing now with Russias aggression against Ukraine.\n\nAs for the results of the meeting, again, it was a meeting that was narrowly focused on a small set of bilateral issues, bilateral irritants that tend to in some cases get in the way of productive conversations between our two countries. But I just dont have any additional details to offer.\n\nQUESTION: Are those irritants still in place?\n\nMR PRICE: I think it is fair to say that we have more to discuss if we are to remove those irritants entirely.\n\nShannon, do you have a did you have a question?\n\nQUESTION: Oh, me. So for the actually, I do have a question. I apologize if it was brought up. But there are reports that another American was killed while fighting in Ukraine, and her name is Rebecca. I was just wondering if the State Department has any comment on that. And I know, of course, youre limited on what you can say because of privacy and so on.\n\nMR PRICE: Ive seen those reports. What I will say those reports are unconfirmed. Without going into specifics, we have noted before misinformation and disinformation circulating in the context of this conflict. But what I would say from here is that those reports are unconfirmed.\n\nThank you all very much.\n\nQUESTION: Wait, wait. Was there any State Department role or involvement in the transfer and return of operations of the Lockerbie suspect?\n\nMR PRICE: Well have more to say on this later today. What I can say now is that you saw over the weekend that the Department of Justice announced that United States is taking custody of the alleged Pan Am Flight 103 bombmaker. We understand that Abu Agila Mohammad Masud Kheir Al-Marimi has been charged for his alleged role in the bombing of Pan Am 103, and hell be making an initial appearance in Washington, D.C. in this hour, so I dont want to get ahead of that.\n\nBut we have consistently made the point about the long arm of American justice. This was a terrorist attack that resulted in the deaths of 270 people nearly 34 years ago and taking victims from 21 nations along with 190 Americans. We will always remember the victims of this heinous act. We have never stopped pursuing justice in this case on behalf of the American people. If the Department of State has an opportunity to help our partner agencies, including the Department of Justice, fulfill justice in a case like this, we wont hesitate to do that. But I just dont want to get ahead of the process at this time.\n\nQUESTION: Well, Im not asking you to get ahead of any process. Im asking you if you had any role in the actual getting him here to the court?\n\nMR PRICE: I what I can\n\nQUESTION: Are you suggesting that we will get more information at this hearing about the State Departments role, if there was one?\n\nMR PRICE: I suspect you will be hearing more on this case generally after this after this appearance, but\n\nQUESTION: But what Im interested in is any State Department role in what has happened to date.\n\nMR PRICE: It is\n\nQUESTION: Not whats going to happen at a court hearing later this afternoon.\n\nMR PRICE: It is safe to say that this happened in consultation with appropriate Libyan authorities, and the United States is in regular contact and discussion with our Libyan counterparts, but I would need to leave it at that.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Thank you all very much.\n\n(The briefing was concluded at 3:20 p.m.)\n\n# # #",

It represented a humane resolution to a painful dilemma that came after tortuous talks with a Russian regime that treats people as geopolitical pawns every day. In that sense, the Biden administration demonstrated the gulf between its moral grounding and that of Russian President Vladimir Putin who is currently demonstrating his inhumanity on another front, with a fearsome assault on Ukrainian civilians.\n\nBut the tragic counterpoint to this diplomatic triumph Bidens failure to also secure the release of Paul Whelan, another American incarcerated in a Russian penal colony underscored the unforgiving moral conundrum he faced. And it prompted top Republicans to charge that he had prioritized a basketball superstar over an ex-marine who benefited from a vocal political pressure campaign on Biden.\n\nThe grave risks of the prisoner swap\n\nThere is no getting around the potential implications of the steps that Biden took, which followed earlier prisoner swaps with US adversaries conducted by his administration including for an American and former US marine detained in Russia, Trevor Reed and those of former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. There is now a considerable risk that other rogue nations or groups see Washington as open for business and may therefore see Americans abroad as increasingly valuable targets in a vicious cycle of more detentions.\n\nFurthermore, the return of Bout, who has been linked to Russian security services, handed Putin a propaganda coup at a time of rising domestic pressure. It enabled him to demonstrate to intelligence operatives engaged in nefarious activity abroad that they will not be forgotten by the Kremlin. Those intelligence services are critical to the Russian leaders continued hold on power as his war in Ukraine deteriorates even further. Still, Bidens strategy also hinted at intriguing diplomatic possibilities, three days after he refused to rule out future talks with Putin, if Ukraines agrees, aimed at ending the vicious war. He showed it was possible to deal with Russia, even amid an effective proxy war between the two old Cold War foes in Ukraine amid the worst relations between Moscow and Washington since the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nAnother notable cog in this deal was Saudi Arabia, which helped facilitate the exchange alongside the United Arab Emirates and also helped secure the release of US citizens captured fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. Whether the kingdom, which has relations with both Moscow and Washington and is seeking to increase its global leadership role, might emerge as a mediator over Ukraine remains to be seen. But its recent smoothing of US-Russia exchanges might put Bidens decision to travel to the country earlier this year and greet its ruthless Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with a fist bump, in a slightly different light.\n\nUltimately, its impossible for there not to be a sour aftertaste when dealing with an adversary as inhumane as Putin. But it is the job of a president to weigh these competing dynamics within the context of Americas national goals and duty to its citizens.\n\nIn cases like these, there is never a right answer.\n\nBiden under pressure to free another American\n\nThe most immediate question now facing Biden is how to extract Whelan, whose hopes were raised and then smashed, as he remained in prison and Griner went home, after both Americans were at the center of US-Russia diplomacy.\n\n\"This is a precarious situation that needs to be resolved quickly,\" a deeply disappointed Whelan told CNNs State Department producer Jennifer Hansler in an exclusive phone interview. \"I would hope that (Biden) and his administration would do everything they could to get me home, regardless of the price they might have to pay at this point.\"\n\nThe harsh truth for Whelan is that Russia refused every inducement the US could offer to include him in an exchange package, leaving Bidens capacity to free him in short order in doubt.\n\nRussian officials told the US side that a one-for-two swap was not acceptable but resisted wider options, US officials said.\n\nJohn Kirby, the National Security Councils coordinator for strategic communications, told CNN that the Kremlin regarded Whelan in a different light than Griner, since hes facing espionage charges even though the US says such allegations are a sham. This added dimension to Whelans incarceration will fuel speculation that Moscow may leverage him as it seeks a three-way deal with Germany to free a former colonel from its domestic spy agency who was convicted of murder last year. CNN reported in August that Russia had requested Vadim Krasikov be included in a deal for the two Americans.\n\nThis adds another layer of complication for Biden as he seeks to get Whelan free, since it involves another government and would require German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to potentially agree to supersede his countrys own legal system. Whether the new German leader has the political capacity to do so is unclear, as is the kind of Russian concession Berlin might require.\n\nA senior administration official said on Thursday evening that there is a recognition in the White House that the US needs to make available \"something more, something different\" from what they have offered to the Russians so far, CNN reported.\n\nWhile Biden is being castigated by some political opponents in Washington for doing a bad deal, administration officials insisted that he got the best one on offer.\n\n\"I want to be very clear this was not a situation where we had a choice of which American to bring home. It was a choice between bringing home one particular American, Brittney Griner, or bringing home none,\" a senior administration official told reporters on Thursday.\n\nEvelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, told CNN she thought Putin was never going to hand over Whelan and all along wanted to swap only Griner for Bout.\n\n\"Its happening now because Vladimir Putin wants this to happen now, he needs a win, he needs a victory in Russia because he is having trouble convincing the Russia people that its a good idea to be at war with Ukraine,\" Farkas said.\n\nShe added that there remained some hope for Whelan because the Griner exchange did show that \"the Russians will make a deal if they think its in their interests.\"\n\nWhelan isnt the only American imprisoned in Russia. The family of US teacher Marc Fogel, who is serving a 14 year sentence at a hard labor camp, has also called for the White House to negotiate his release. Fogel was arrested last year in Moscow after traveling into the country with cannabis that his lawyer said was used for medical purposes.\n\nA political controversy erupts over Griner release\n\nThe fierce political divides that now challenge every US foreign policy decision did not take long to bubble over after Griner was freed alongside a more vicious reaction on social media as some conservatives questioned her patriotism.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was relieved Griner was free but raised questions about the wisdom of such exchanges and whether they could endanger other Americans.\n\n\"I think the challenge this points to is these regimes know this. This is why (President Nicolas) Maduro traded five Citgo executives who were lured to Venezuela to get arrested for his nephews who are convicted drug traffickers,\" Rubio said.\n\n\"Thats why you trade a professional basketball player with CBD oil for the Merchant of Death. These are bad trades,\" he said.\n\nAnother Republican, Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida described the deal to free Griner in a Twitter post as \"shameful\" and accused the administration of \"giving priority to a celebrity over a veteran.\"\n\nIn a later interview with CNNs Jake Tapper, Waltz said: \"This is a tactical victory, I am glad she is coming home. But this is a strategic loss.\"\n\n\"The reason the Iranian regime, the Taliban, Putin himself, continue to take Americans hostage is we continue to make concessions. When do we start dictating the terms to these regimes?\"\n\nWhelans family reacted with great dignity in welcoming Griners release, despite their devastation that their brother did not come home. Elizabeth Whelan, Pauls sister, called for political unity over the fate of hostages abroad, saying that hostile foreign countries are trying to use such cases to stir dissent in the US.\n\nWhelan also urged people to understand the human angle of Bidens dilemma despite the grave geopolitical issues at stake.\n\n\"Its an amazing thing to be able to get Brittney back. Its a win for us,\" she said.\n\n\"We tend to always look at what is Russia getting out of this? We are getting a wrongfully detained American back home. Its something to celebrate.\"",

                "cc_text": "The world is facing a Zeitenwende: an epochal tectonic shift. Russias war of aggression against Ukraine has put an end to an era. New powers have emerged or reemerged, including an economically strong and politically assertive China. In this new multipolar world, different countries and models of government are competing for power and influence.\n\nAuf Deutsch lesen (Read in German)\n\nFor its part, Germany is doing everything it can to defend and foster an international order based on the principles of the UN Charter. Its democracy, security, and prosperity depend on binding power to common rules. That is why Germans are intent on becoming the guarantor of European security that our allies expect us to be, a bridge builder within the European Union and an advocate for multilateral solutions to global problems. This is the only way for Germany to successfully navigate the geopolitical rifts of our time.\n\nThe Zeitenwende goes beyond the war in Ukraine and beyond the issue of European security. The central question is this: How can we, as Europeans and as the European Union, remain independent actors in an increasingly multipolar world?\n\nGermany and Europe can help defend the rules-based international order without succumbing to the fatalistic view that the world is doomed to once again separate into competing blocs. My countrys history gives it a special responsibility to fight the forces of fascism, authoritarianism, and imperialism. At the same time, our experience of being split in half during an ideological and geopolitical contest gives us a particular appreciation of the risks of a new cold war.\n\nEND OF AN ERA\n\nFor most of the world, the three decades since the Iron Curtain fell have been a period of relative peace and prosperity. Technological advances have created an unprecedented level of connectivity and cooperation. Growing international trade, globe-spanning value and production chains, and unparalleled exchanges of people and knowledge across borders have brought over a billion people out of poverty. Most important, courageous citizens all over the world have swept away dictatorships and one-party rule. Their yearning for liberty, dignity, and democracy changed the course of history. Two devastating world wars and a great deal of sufferingmuch of it caused by my countrywere followed by more than four decades of tension and confrontation in the shadow of possible nuclear annihilation. But by the 1990s, it seemed that a more resilient world order had finally taken hold.\n\nGermans, in particular, could count their blessings. In November 1989, the Berlin Wall was brought down by the brave citizens of East Germany. Only 11 months later, the country was reunified, thanks to far-sighted politicians and support from partners in both the West and the East. Finally, \"what belongs together could grow together,\" as former German Chancellor Willy Brandt put it shortly after the wall came down.\n\nThose words applied not only to Germany but also to Europe as a whole. Former members of the Warsaw Pact chose to become allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and members of the EU. \"Europe whole and free,\" in the formulation of George H. W. Bush, the U.S. president at the time, no longer seemed like an unfounded hope. In this new era, it seemed possible that Russia would become a partner to the West rather than the adversary that the Soviet Union had been. As a result, most European countries shrank their armies and cut their defense budgets. For Germany, the rationale was simple: Why maintain a large defense force of some 500,000 soldiers when all our neighbors appeared to be friends or partners?\n\nThe world is not doomed to once again separate into competing blocs.\n\nThe focus of our security and defense policy quickly shifted toward other pressing threats. The Balkan wars and the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in 2001, including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, heightened the importance of regional and global crisis management. Solidarity within NATO remained intact, however: the 9/11 attacks led to the first decision to trigger Article 5, the mutual defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty, and for two decades, NATO forces fought terrorism shoulder to shoulder in Afghanistan.\n\nGermanys business communities drew their own conclusions from the new course of history. The fall of the Iron Curtain and an ever more integrated global economy opened new opportunities and markets, particularly in the countries of the former Eastern bloc but also in other countries with emerging economies, especially China. Russia, with its vast resources of energy and other raw materials, had proved to be a reliable supplier during the Cold War, and it seemed sensible, at least at first, to expand that promising partnership in peacetime.\n\nThe Russian leadership, however, experienced the dissolution of the former Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact and drew conclusions that differed sharply from those of leaders in Berlin and other European capitals. Instead of seeing the peaceful overthrow of communist rule as an opportunity for more freedom and democracy, Russian President Vladimir Putin has called it \"the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century.\" The economic and political turmoil in parts of the post-Soviet space in the 1990s only exacerbated the feeling of loss and anguish that many Russian citizens to this day associate with the end of the Soviet Union.\n\nIt was in that environment that authoritarianism and imperialistic ambitions began to reemerge. In 2007, Putin delivered an aggressive speech at the Munich Security Conference, deriding the rules-based international order as a mere tool of American dominance. The following year, Russia launched a war against Georgia. In 2014, Russia occupied and annexed Crimea and sent its forces into parts of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, in direct violation of international law and Moscows own treaty commitments. The years that followed saw the Kremlin undercut arms control treaties and expand its military capabilities, poison and murder Russian dissidents, crack down on civil society, and carry out a brutal military intervention in support of the Assad regime in Syria. Step by step, Putins Russia chose a path that took it further from Europe and further from a cooperative, peaceful order.\n\nEMPIRE STRIKES BACK\n\nDuring the eight years that followed the illegal annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of conflict in eastern Ukraine, Germany and its European and international partners in the G-7 focused on safeguarding the sovereignty and political independence of Ukraine, preventing further escalation by Russia and restoring and preserving peace in Europe. The approach chosen was a combination of political and economic pressure that coupled restrictive measures on Russia with dialogue. Together with France, Germany engaged in the so-called Normandy Format that led to the Minsk agreements and the corresponding Minsk process, which called for Russia and Ukraine to commit to a cease-fire and take a number of other steps. Despite setbacks and a lack of trust between Moscow and Kyiv, Germany and France kept the process running. But a revisionist Russia made it impossible for diplomacy to succeed.\n\nRussias brutal attack on Ukraine in February 2022 then ushered in a fundamentally new reality: imperialism had returned to Europe. Russia is using some of the most gruesome military methods of the twentieth century and causing unspeakable suffering in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have already lost their lives; many more have been wounded or traumatized. Millions of Ukrainian citizens have had to flee their homes, seeking refuge in Poland and other European countries; one million of them have come to Germany. Russian artillery, missiles, and bombs have reduced Ukrainian homes, schools, and hospitals to rubble. Mariupol, Irpin, Kherson, Izyum: these places will forever serve to remind the world of Russias crimesand the perpetrators must be brought to justice.\n\nBut the impact of Russias war goes beyond Ukraine. When Putin gave the order to attack, he shattered a European and international peace architecture that had taken decades to build. Under Putins leadership, Russia has defied even the most basic principles of international law as enshrined in the UN Charter: the renunciation of the use of force as a means of international policy and the pledge to respect the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of all countries. Acting as an imperial power, Russia now seeks to redraw borders by force and to divide the world, once again, into blocs and spheres of influence.\n\nA STRONGER EUROPE\n\nThe world must not let Putin get his way; Russias revanchist imperialism must be stopped. The crucial role for Germany at this moment is to step up as one of the main providers of security in Europe by investing in our military, strengthening the European defense industry, beefing up our military presence on NATOs eastern flank, and training and equipping Ukraines armed forces.\n\nGermanys new role will require a new strategic culture, and the national security strategy that my government will adopt a few months from now will reflect this fact. For the last three decades, decisions regarding Germanys security and the equipment of the countrys armed forces were taken against the backdrop of a Europe at peace. Now, the guiding question will be which threats we and our allies must confront in Europe, most immediately from Russia. These include potential assaults on allied territory, cyberwarfare, and even the remote chance of a nuclear attack, which Putin has not so subtly threatened.\n\nThe transatlantic partnership is and remains vital to confronting these challenges. U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration deserve praise for building and investing in strong partnerships and alliances across the globe. But a balanced and resilient transatlantic partnership also requires that Germany and Europe play active roles. One of the first decisions that my government made in the aftermath of Russias attack on Ukraine was to designate a special fund of approximately $100 billion to better equip our armed forces, the Bundeswehr. We even changed our constitution to set up this fund. This decision marks the starkest change in German security policy since the establishment of the Bundeswehr in 1955. Our soldiers will receive the political support, materials, and capabilities they need to defend our country and our allies. The goal is a Bundeswehr that we and our allies can rely on. To achieve it, Germany will invest two percent of our gross domestic product in our defense.\n\nGerman members of the NATO Response Force in Baumholder, Germany, November 2022 Wolfgang Rattay / Reuters\n\nThese changes reflect a new mindset in German society. Today, a large majority of Germans agree that their country needs an army able and ready to deter its adversaries and defend itself and its allies. Germans stand with Ukrainians as they defend their country against Russian aggression. From 2014 to 2020, Germany was Ukraines largest source of private investments and government assistance combined. And since Russias invasion began, Germany has boosted its financial and humanitarian support for Ukraine and has helped coordinate the international response while holding the presidency of the G-7.\n\nThe Zeitenwende also led my government to reconsider a decades-old, well-established principle of German policy on arms exports. Today, for the first time in Germanys recent history, we are delivering weapons into a war fought between two countries. In my exchanges with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, I have made one thing very clear: Germany will sustain its efforts to support Ukraine for as long as necessary. What Ukraine needs most today are artillery and air-defense systems, and that is precisely what Germany is delivering, in close coordination with our allies and partners. German support to Ukraine also includes antitank weapons, armored troop carriers, antiaircraft guns and missiles, and counterbattery radar systems. A new EU mission will offer training for up to 15,000 Ukrainian troops, including up to 5,000an entire brigadein Germany. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic, Greece, Slovakia, and Slovenia have delivered or have pledged to deliver around 100 Soviet-era main battle tanks to Ukraine; Germany, in turn, will then provide those countries with refurbished German tanks. This way, Ukraine is receiving tanks that Ukrainian forces know well and have experience using and that can be easily integrated into Ukraines existing logistics and maintenance schemes.\n\nNATOs actions must not lead to a direct confrontation with Russia, but the alliance must credibly deter further Russian aggression. To that end, Germany has significantly increased its presence on NATOs eastern flank, reinforcing the German-led NATO battle group in Lithuania and designating a brigade to ensure that countrys security. Germany is also contributing troops to NATOs battle group in Slovakia, and the German air force is helping monitor and secure airspace in Estonia and Poland. Meanwhile, the German navy has participated in NATOs deterrence and defense activities in the Baltic Sea. Germany will also contribute an armored division, as well as significant air and naval assets (all in states of high readiness) to NATOs New Force Model, which is designed to improve the alliances ability to respond quickly to any contingency. And Germany will continue to uphold its commitment to NATOs nuclear sharing arrangements, including by purchasing dual-capable F-35 fighter jets.\n\nOur message to Moscow is very clear: we are determined to defend every single inch of NATO territory against any possible aggression. We will honor NATOs solemn pledge that an attack on any one ally will be considered an attack on the entire alliance. We have also made it clear to Russia that its recent rhetoric concerning nuclear weapons is reckless and irresponsible. When I visited Beijing in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping and I concurred that threatening the use of nuclear weapons was unacceptable and that the use of such horrific weapons would cross a redline that humankind has rightly drawn. Putin should mark these words.\n\nOur message to Moscow is very clear: we are determined to defend every single inch of NATO territory.\n\nAmong the many miscalculations that Putin has made is his bet that the invasion of Ukraine would strain relations among his adversaries. In fact, the reverse has happened: the EU and the transatlantic alliance are stronger than ever before. Nowhere is this more evident than in the unprecedented economic sanctions that Russia is facing. It was clear from the outset of the war that these sanctions would have to be in place for a long time, as their effectiveness increases with each passing week. Putin needs to understand that not a single sanction will be lifted should Russia try to dictate the terms of a peace deal.\n\nAll the leaders of the G-7 countries have commended Zelenskys readiness for a just peace that respects the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and safeguards Ukraines ability to defend itself in the future. In coordination with our partners, Germany stands ready to reach arrangements to sustain Ukraines security as part of a potential postwar peace settlement. We will not, however, accept the illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory, poorly disguised by sham referendums. To end this war, Russia must withdraw its troops.\n\nGOOD FOR THE CLIMATE, BAD FOR RUSSIA\n\nRussias war has not only unified the EU, NATO, and the G-7 in opposition to his aggression; it has also catalyzed changes in economic and energy policy that will hurt Russia in the long runand give a boost to the vital transition to clean energy that was already underway. Right after taking office as German chancellor in December 2021, I asked my advisers whether we had a plan in place should Russia decide to stop its gas deliveries to Europe. The answer was no, even though we had become dangerously dependent on Russian gas deliveries.\n\nWe immediately started preparing for the worst-case scenario. In the days before Russias all-out invasion of Ukraine, Germany suspended the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set to significantly increase Russian gas supplies to Europe. In February 2022, plans were already on the table to import liquefied natural gas from the global market outside Europeand in the coming months, the first floating LNG terminals will go into service on the German coast.\n\nThe worst-case scenario soon materialized, as Putin decided to weaponize energy by cutting supplies to Germany and the rest of Europe. But Germany has now completely phased out the importation of Russian coal, and EU imports of Russian oil will soon end. We have learned our lesson: Europes security relies on diversifying its energy suppliers and routes and on investing in energy independence. In September, the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines drove home that message.\n\nTo bridge any potential energy shortages in Germany and Europe as a whole, my government is bringing coal-fired power plants back onto the grid temporarily and allowing German nuclear power plants to operate longer than originally planned. We have also mandated that privately owned gas storage facilities meet progressively higher minimum filling levels. Today, our facilities are completely full, whereas levels at this time last year were unusually low. This is a good basis for Germany and Europe to get through the winter without gas shortages.\n\nRussias war showed us that reaching these ambitious targets is also necessary to defend our security and independence, as well as the security and independence of Europe. Moving away from fossil energy sources will increase the demand for electricity and green hydrogen, and Germany is preparing for that outcome by massively speeding up the shift to renewable energies such as wind and solar power. Our goals are clear: by 2030, at least 80 percent of the electricity Germans use will be generated by renewables, and by 2045, Germany will achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, or \"climate neutrality.\"\n\nPUTINS WORST NIGHTMARE\n\nPutin wanted to divide Europe into zones of influence and to divide the world into blocs of great powers and vassal states. Instead, his war has served only to advance the EU. At the European Council in June 2022, the EU granted Ukraine and Moldova the status of \"candidate countries\" and reaffirmed that Georgias future lies with Europe. We also agreed that the EU accession of all six countries of the western Balkans must finally become a reality, a goal to which I am personally committed. That is why I have revived the so-called Berlin Process for the western Balkans, which intends to deepen cooperation in the region, bringing its countries and their citizens closer together and preparing them for EU integration.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that expanding the EU and integrating new members will be difficult; nothing would be worse than giving millions of people false hope. But the way is open, and the goal is clear: an EU that will consist of over 500 million free citizens, representing the largest internal market in the world, that will set global standards on trade, growth, climate change, and environmental protection and that will host leading research institutes and innovative businessesa family of stable democracies enjoying unparalleled social welfare and public infrastructure.\n\nAs the EU moves toward that goal, its adversaries will continue to try to drive wedges between its members. Putin has never accepted the EU as a political actor. After all, the EUa union of free, sovereign, democratic states based on the rule of lawis the antithesis of his imperialistic and autocratic kleptocracy.\n\nPutin and others will try to turn our own open, democratic systems against us, through disinformation campaigns and influence peddling. European citizens have a wide variety of views, and European political leaders discuss and sometimes argue about the right way forward, especially during geopolitical and economic challenges. But these characteristics of our open societies are features, not bugs; they are the essence of democratic decision-making. Our goal today, however, is to close ranks on crucial areas in which disunity would make Europe more vulnerable to foreign interference. Crucial to that mission is ever-closer cooperation between Germany and France, which share the same vision of a strong and sovereign EU.\n\nNicols Ortega\n\nMore broadly, the EU must overcome old conflicts and find new solutions. European migration and fiscal policy are cases in point. People will continue to come to Europe, and Europe needs immigrants, so the EU must devise an immigration strategy that is pragmatic and aligns with its values. This means reducing irregular migration and at the same time strengthening legal paths to Europe, in particular for the skilled workers that our labor markets need. On fiscal policy, the union has established a recovery and resilience fund that will also help address the current challenges posed by high energy prices. The union must also do away with selfish blocking tactics in its decision-making processes by eliminating the ability of individual countries to veto certain measures. As the EU expands and becomes a geopolitical actor, quick decision-making will be the key to success. For that reason, Germany has proposed gradually extending the practice of making decisions by majority voting to areas that currently fall under the unanimity rule, such as EU foreign policy and taxation.\n\nEurope must also continue to assume greater responsibility for its own security and needs a coordinated and integrated approach to building its defense capabilities. For example, the militaries of EU member states operate too many different weapons systems, which creates practical and economic inefficiencies. To address these problems, the EU must change its internal bureaucratic procedures, which will require courageous political decisions; EU member states, including Germany, will have to alter their national policies and regulations on exporting jointly manufactured military systems.\n\nOne field in which Europe urgently needs to make progress is defense in the air and space domains. That is why Germany will be strengthening its air defense over the coming years, as part of the NATO framework, by acquiring additional capabilities. I opened this initiative to our European neighbors, and the result is the European Sky Shield Initiative, which 14 other European states joined last October. Joint air defense in Europe will be more efficient and cost effective than if all of us go it alone, and it offers an outstanding example of what it means to strengthen the European pillar within NATO.\n\nNATO is the ultimate guarantor of Euro-Atlantic security, and its strength will only grow with the addition of two prosperous democracies, Finland and Sweden, as members. But NATO is also made stronger when its European members independently take steps toward greater compatibility between their defense structures, within the framework of the EU.\n\nTHE CHINA CHALLENGEAND BEYOND\n\nRussias war of aggression might have triggered the Zeitenwende, but the tectonic shifts run much deeper. History did not end, as some predicted, with the Cold War. Nor, however, is history repeating itself. Many assume we are on the brink of an era of bipolarity in the international order. They see the dawn of a new cold war approaching, one that will pit the United States against China.\n\nI do not subscribe to this view. Instead, I believe that what we are witnessing is the end of an exceptional phase of globalization, a historic shift accelerated by, but not entirely the result of, external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russias war in Ukraine. During that exceptional phase, North America and Europe experienced 30 years of stable growth, high employment rates, and low inflation, and the United States became the worlds decisive powera role it will retain in the twenty-first century.\n\nBut during the postCold War phase of globalization, China also became a global player, as it had been in earlier long periods of world history. Chinas rise does not warrant isolating Beijing or curbing cooperation. But neither does Chinas growing power justify claims for hegemony in Asia and beyond. No country is the backyard of any otherand that applies to Europe as much as it does to Asia and every other region. During my recent visit to Beijing, I expressed firm support for the rules-based international order, as enshrined in the UN Charter, as well as for open and fair trade. In concert with its European partners, Germany will continue to demand a level playing field for European and Chinese companies. China does too little in this regard and has taken a noticeable turn toward isolation and away from openness.\n\nIn Beijing, I also raised concerns over the growing insecurity in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait and questioned Chinas approach to human rights and individual freedoms. Respecting basic rights and freedoms can never be an \"internal matter\" for individual states because every UN member state vows to uphold them.\n\nWind turbines in front of a coal-fired power plant near Jackerath, Germany, March 2022 Wolfgang Rattay / Reuters\n\nMeanwhile, as China and the countries of North America and Europe adjust to the changing realities of globalizations new phase, many countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America that enabled exceptional growth in the past by producing goods and raw materials at low costs are now gradually becoming more prosperous and have their own demand for resources, goods, and services. These regions have every right to seize the opportunities that globalization offers and to demand a stronger role in global affairs in line with their growing economic and demographic weight. That poses no threat to citizens in Europe or North America. On the contrary, we should encourage these regions greater participation in and integration into the international order. This is the best way to keep multilateralism alive in a multipolar world.\n\nThat is why Germany and the EU are investing in new partnerships and broadening existing ones with many countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Many of them share a fundamental characteristic with us: they, too, are democracies. This commonality plays a crucial rolenot because we aim to pit democracies against authoritarian states, which would only contribute to a new global dichotomy, but because sharing democratic values and systems will help us define joint priorities and achieve common goals in the new multipolar reality of the twenty-first century. We might all have become capitalists (with the possible exception of North Korea and a tiny handful of other countries), to paraphrase an argument the economist Branko Milanovic made a few years ago. But it makes a huge difference whether capitalism is organized in a liberal, democratic way or along authoritarian lines.\n\nTake the global response to COVID-19. Early in the pandemic, some argued that authoritarian states would prove more adept at crisis management, since they can plan better for the long term and can make tough decisions more quickly. But the pandemic track records of authoritarian countries hardly support that view. Meanwhile, the most effective COVID-19 vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments were all developed in free democracies. What is more, unlike authoritarian states, democracies have the ability to self-correct as citizens express their views freely and choose their political leaders. The constant debating and questioning in our societies, parliaments, and free media may sometimes feel exhausting. But it is what makes our systems more resilient in the long run.\n\nChinas rise does not warrant isolating Beijing or curbing cooperation.\n\nFreedom, equality, the rule of law, and the dignity of every human being are values not exclusive to what has been traditionally understood as the West. Rather, they are shared by citizens and governments around the world, and the UN Charter reaffirms them as fundamental human rights in its preamble. But autocratic and authoritarian regimes often challenge or deny these rights and principles. To defend them, the countries of the EU, including Germany, must cooperate more closely with democracies outside the West, as traditionally defined. In the past, we have purported to treat the countries of Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America as equals. But too often, our words have not been backed by deeds. This must change. During Germanys presidency of the G-7, the group has coordinated its agenda closely with Indonesia, which holds the G-20 presidency. We have also involved in our deliberations Senegal, which holds the presidency of the African Union; Argentina, which holds the presidency of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States; our G-20 partner South Africa; and India, which will hold the G-20 presidency next year.\n\nEventually, in a multipolar world, dialogue and cooperation must extend beyond the democratic comfort zone. The United States new National Security Strategy rightly acknowledges the need to engage with \"countries that do not embrace democratic institutions but nevertheless depend upon and support a rules-based international system.\" The worlds democracies will need to work with these countries to defend and uphold a global order that binds power to rules and that confronts revisionist acts such as Russias war of aggression. This effort will take pragmatism and a degree of humility.\n\nThe journey toward the democratic freedom we enjoy today has been full of setbacks and errors. Yet certain rights and principles were established and accepted centuries ago. Habeas corpus, the protection from arbitrary detention, is one such fundamental rightand was first recognized not by a democratic government but by the absolutist monarchy of King Charles II of England. Equally important is the basic principle that no country can take by force what belongs to its neighbor. Respect for these fundamental rights and principles should be required of all states, regardless of their internal political systems.\n\nPeriods of relative peace and prosperity in human history, such as the one that most of the world experienced in the early postCold War era, need not be rare interludes or mere deviations from a historical norm in which brute force dictates the rules. And although we cannot turn back the clock, we can still turn back the tide of aggression and imperialism. Todays complex, multipolar world renders this task more challenging. To carry it out, Germany and its partners in the EU, the United States, the G-7, and NATO must protect our open societies, stand up for our democratic values, and strengthen our alliances and partnerships. But we must also avoid the temptation to once again divide the world into blocs. This means making every effort to build new partnerships, pragmatically and without ideological blinders. In todays densely interconnected world, the goal of advancing peace, prosperity, and human freedom calls for a different mindset and different tools. Developing that mindset and those tools is ultimately what the Zeitenwende is all about.",

                "summary": "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is working closely with the Ukrainian government to establish a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a proposal aimed at protecting the facility from the ongoing conflict (1). Despite Russian officials casting doubt on the idea, the IAEA has managed to extend its access to the plant for an additional 120 days to assess safety conditions, highlighting the role of diplomacy in managing war-related risks (2). However, proposals for a demilitarized zone have faced setbacks, with the Russian Foreign Ministry's response suggesting a lack of agreement on the establishment of such a protected area (3). The urgency for IAEA intervention is underscored by local reports of shelling near the plant and accusations of the site being used as a weapons depot, which compounds the risk and necessitates international efforts to secure the facility (4,5).",
                "more_detailed": "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), working closely with the Ukrainian government, is striving to establish a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been under Russian control since early in the conflict (1,8). Ukrainian officials, including Dmytro Kuleba, have been in constant communication with IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, who is actively seeking to broker a deal to safeguard the facility and its vicinity (1). Despite the challenges, the IAEA has managed to gain access to the plant for inspection and to assess the safety of the Ukrainian staff, who are reportedly being held by Russian forces (2). However, the proposal for a demilitarized zone has faced setbacks, with Russian officials casting doubt on the feasibility of such an initiative (3,4).\n\nThe IAEA's efforts to create a protected zone are critical, given the frequent shelling in the area, which has heightened the risk of a nuclear accident (9). The Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest nuclear power station, is not designed to withstand direct military attacks, and an attack could potentially release significant radiation (7). The situation has led to alarm from Western powers and the UN atomic energy agency, with talks to demilitarize the area stalling (5). Nonetheless, Grossi remains committed to reaching an agreement to protect the power plant, hopefully by the year's end, demonstrating the IAEA's dedication to mitigating the risks of a nuclear incident amid the ongoing conflict (6,9)."

The IAEA has been actively seeking an agreement with both Russia and Ukraine to ensure the plant's protection, with Director General Rafael Grossi aiming for a resolution by the end of the year (7).\n\nDiplomatic strategies to prioritize nuclear safety could involve providing assurances to Russia post-conflict, as suggested by French President Emmanuel Macron, although this approach has sparked controversy in Ukraine (5). Furthermore, discussions on creating a security zone have shown some \"positive dynamics,\" according to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov (4). In addition to Macron's proposal, the IAEA's potential role as a neutral presence at the nuclear plants could serve as a foundation for negotiations, with the agency's staff ensuring that the facilities are not used for military leverage (6). There also appears to be a willingness from Moscow to negotiate control over the plant, potentially using it as a bargaining chip for transit guarantees, which could lead to a diplomatic opening if substantiated (9,10)."

The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, is seeking to reach an agreement with both countries to protect the plant, with discussions on creating a security zone around the facility showing \"positive dynamics\" according to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov (3,5).

Russia and Ukraine have exchanged accusations regarding shelling around the site, with both sides blaming each other for risking a nuclear disaster (1,4,5,10). The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has stressed the precarious situation at the plant and has deployed teams on-site, with Director General Rafael Grossi seeking to establish a security zone around the plant and to protect it through an agreement that would involve the Russian side (3,4,5,6).\n\nEfforts to secure the plant and prevent nuclear terrorism are complicated by the differing positions of Russia and Ukraine. Russia has claimed to have annexed the region and considers the plant to be on \"Russian territory,\" rejecting proposals for a demilitarized zone (3,7,10). Ukraine, supported by international efforts led by the IAEA and a conference hosted by France, aims to maintain control over its nuclear facilities and prevent further escalation of risks (5,6,9). Reconciliation may require both parties to engage in dialogue, with pressures from international bodies like the IAEA and influential countries to encourage a return to the negotiating table and to prioritize nuclear safety over territorial control (2,4,6,9)."

Russian troops have occupied the plant since March, with Russia claiming the plant is on its territory and asserting that only they can ensure its safety, a claim that has been disputed by Ukraine and international bodies (2,4,6). This has led to a tense situation with the plant in a precarious state, as shelling has continued around the site. Ukraine has called for the demilitarization of the area, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has proposed creating a demilitarized zone around the plant. However, the Russian Foreign Ministry has rejected these proposals, undermining diplomatic efforts and raising fears of a potential nuclear disaster (3,7).\n\nThe IAEA has been actively involved in trying to establish a safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, given that it is Europe's largest and the risks of radioactivity release are high. The agency, along with Western powers, has raised alarms over the safety of the plant's six nuclear reactors. However, negotiations aimed at demilitarizing the area have stalled as Russia maintains control and denies any possibility of withdrawing its troops or transferring control to a third party. The West continues to support Ukraine and calls for pressure on Russia to return to negotiations, emphasizing the importance of avoiding escalation around civilian nuclear power. Yet, the Russian position has impeded progress, leaving the situation unresolved and the risk of a nuclear incident a significant concern (5,8,9,10)."

IAEA teams are set to deploy to various nuclear plants in Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, to monitor for any external attempts to influence them, such as shelling, which has been attributed to Russian aggression (1). IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has held meetings with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the demilitarization of the nuclear plant and the establishment of a safety zone around it, recognizing that the IAEA's involvement is the only viable way forward (1,3). Moreover, Grossi has stressed the importance of maintaining the plant's electricity supply for cooling and emergency systems, despite periodic attacks on the electrical grid (5).\n\nTo further mitigate the risks, both Ukrainian and Russian officials have called for measures to ensure the plant's security. Shmygal reiterated Ukraine's call for the plant's demilitarization as a priority for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, while Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has accused Ukraine of shelling the plant and has declared that Russian forces are taking all necessary measures to ensure its safety (1,2,7). In the broader context of the conflict, there have been calls for continued diplomatic engagement, with French President Emmanuel Macron emphasizing the need to pressure Russia to return to negotiations and to prevent escalation around civilian nuclear power (10). Additionally, efforts to manage nuclear safety risks through international cooperation, such as prisoner exchanges and grain passage deals, have been suggested as ways to lessen the conflict's impact while maintaining focus on the critical issue of nuclear safety at Zaporizhzhia (8)."

                "cc_text": "Alleged Ukrainian attacks on theZaporizhzhianuclear power plant (ZNPP) constitute \"nuclear terrorism,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed on Tuesday. \"In the last two weeks alone, 33 large-caliber projectiles have been fired at the [nuclear power] station by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,\" Shoigu said, according to a readout of a meeting with the leadership of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Russian air defense forces are intercepting most Ukrainian weapons, Shoigu added, but some have still managed to hit objects that affect the safety of the nuclear power plant. \"We classify these attacks by Ukrainian troops as nuclear terrorism,\" he said. Shoigu said Russia's army will continue to protect critical facilities in the captured territories. Some context: Since falling under Russian control, frequent shelling in and around the plant has raised fears about a nuclear accident. Both sides have accused the other of nuclear terrorism, with Ukraine alleging that the Kremlin is using the nuclear plant as a cover to protect troops and launch attacks. Last week, Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said he hoped to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica published on Friday, Grossi said his commitment was to reach a solution \"as soon as possible,\" hopefully by the end of the year, he added. But Russian Foreign Ministry spokespersonMaria Zakharova said that there can be \"no talk of any withdrawal of ZNPP from Russia or transfer control over it to a third party.\" \"The station is located on Russian territory and is fully controlled by Russia,\" said Zakharova on Monday. \"We presume that only we are able to ensure the physical and nuclear safety of ZNPP.\"",

                "cc_text": "A top Ukrainian official said his government is working with the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency to create a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, after Russian officials appeared to cast doubt on the idea. After a meeting with his Slovak counterpart, Kuleba said Ukraine remained in close contact with IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, who has been trying to broker a deal that would protect the plant and its surroundings from the conflict. Kuleba said it was extremely difficult to assure the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power plants \"without stopping Russian missile attacks on the territory of Ukraine.\" And earlier Thursday, Ukraine's state-owned nuclear company Energoatom said Russian forces had deployed new weapons at the plant. It claimed Russia brought several \"Grad\" rocket launchers to the plant and situated them close to one of the reactors and the storage for spent nuclear fuel. CNN is unable to confirm the allegation. What Russia said: Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova appeared to cast doubt on the prospects for an agreement earlier this week. She was asked: \"The head of the IAEA R. Grossi said that experts are close to an acceptable agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the creation of a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia NPP (ZNPP). How would you comment on this statement? Is it possible to transfer control over ZNPP to a third party? Is the visit of the head of the IAEA R. Grossi to Russia expected?\" \"There can be no talk of any withdrawal of the Zaporizhzhia NPP from Russian control or transfer of control over it to some 'third party,'\" Zakharova responded.\"The station is located on Russian territory and is fully controlled by Russia. We presume that only we are able to ensure the physical and nuclear safety of ZNPP.\" Some background: Zaporizhzhia is one of the four Ukrainian regions annexed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in defiance of international law. Putin also signed a decree federalizing the territory's nuclear plant, which has been occupied by Russian troops for months. Ukraine has said plant employees were forced to obtain Russian passports and sign employment contracts with Russia's state nuclear energy agency. CNN has been unable to verify those allegations.",

Shoigu said Russian forces were taking \"all measures\" to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europes largest, in the face of what he called \"nuclear terrorism\" from Kyiv, Reuters reported. Ukraine denies shelling the facility, which has been under the control of Russian forces since the first days of the war, and has accused Russia of firing on it. \"Our units are taking all measures to ensure the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,\" Shoigu told his military chiefs in a conference call, an abridged transcript of which was published by the defence ministry. \"In turn, the Kyiv regime seeks to create the appearance of a threat of a nuclear catastrophe by continuing to deliberately shell the site,\" he added. Shoigu said Ukraine had fired 33 large-caliber shells at the plant in the last two weeks. Most had been intercepted by Russian air defences, he said, though \"some still hit objects that affect the safe operation of the nuclear power plant\". \"We classify these attacks by Ukrainian troops as nuclear terrorism,\" he added. Reuters was unable to independently verify the claims. Both Moscow and Kyiv blame each other for attacks on the facility. Kyiv has also accused Moscow of using the plant as a de facto weapons depot.\n\nUpdated at 05.31 EST\n\n6 Dec 2022 13.16 EST The European Commission is reportedly considering a ban on new investments in Russias mining sector as part of a fresh package of sanctions against Moscow, aimed at further eroding the Kremlins ability to fund its war against Ukraine. Sources have told the Financial Times that the mining investment ban is part of a ninth EU sanctions package, which officials aim to discuss with member states and have agreed by the end of next week. If approved, the ban, which the paper writes will exempt some specific products, would mark the first time Brussels has directly targeted Russias metals sector. The FT said the new sanctions package could also include export controls on civilian technologies that Brussels believes Russia is using to support its arms factories, a ban on transactions with three more Russian banks, and targeted sanctions against another 180 individuals.\n\n6 Dec 2022 12.53 EST Ukrainian hospitals to temporarily suspend planned surgeries due to blackouts Ukraines health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts as a result of Russian missile strikes targeting the countrys critical infrastructure. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Health Ministry recommends suspending elective surgeries, hospitalizations due to blackouts.\n\nThe move will reduce the load on Ukrainian hospitals and allow them to provide emergency care during possible electricity cut-offs, the Health Ministry said.

TV Rain, or Dozhd in Russian, moved to broadcasting from Latvia in July, when it was forced to shut its Moscow studio after accusations by Russias communications watchdog that it was spreading \"deliberately false information about the actions of Russian military personnel\" in Ukraine. The station was earlier this month fined 10,000 by the Latvian regulator for displaying a map of Russia which included the occupied Crimea peninsula. It was also forced to apologise to viewers and fired a presenter, Alexei Korostelyov, on Friday for comments he made on air, after he said he hoped that the stations efforts would help provide Russian soldiers with basic equipment and amenities. The network, which was founded in 2010 as the main opposition channel in Russia, has also been accused of failing to ensure Latvian language translation, local media reported. Abolins told reporters today that Latvias counterintelligence and internal security service had informed his office that the station represented a threat to the countrys security. TV Rain dismissed the accusations as \"unfair and absurd\" and said its programmes could still be seen on YouTube, which is where most of its audience watches its content. Its founder, Natalya Sindeeva, posted a video this afternoon describing Korostelyovs firing as \"the worst thing we could have done in that situation\". But in this emotional video, @sindeeva, TV Rain's founder, says firing the anchor, Alexei Korostelyov, was \"the worst thing we could have done in that situation.\" She begs him and three other staffers who quit in protest at his firing to come back. pic.twitter.com/qvN5C1yjZm max seddon (@maxseddon) December 6, 2022 The move comes as Latvia faces a growing rift between the countrys Latvian majority and its Russian-speaking minority. A quarter of the population of two million in Latvia are Russian speakers. The charity Reporters without Borders called the move a \"serious blow to freedom of information\". Several other Russian newsrooms have also found refuge in the Latvian capital, including Novaya Gazeta Europe and Deutsche Welles Moscow branch. The city has also hosted independent news website Meduza since 2014. The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the move showed foreign states were no freer than Russia. He told reporters today: Some always think that elsewhere is better than home. And some always think that freedom is elsewhere and there is no freedom at home. This is one of the clearest examples that demonstrate the fallacy of such illusions.\n\nUpdated at 12.33 EST\n\n6 Dec 2022 11.31 EST Moldovas prime minister, Natalia Gavrilia, has pledged to boost cooperation between her country and Ukraine during a visit to the towns of Bucha and Irpin.

Suedi Murekezi, 35, was detained on 10 June by Russian occupying forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he told the Guardian on Monday that he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi said he had been unable to leave Donetsk because he did not have any identity papers. Suedi Murekezi was arrested a few months into the Russian occupation of Kherson when he tried to change the oil in his car. Photograph: Youtube In a phone interview from the city of Donetsk, the capital of the Russian-annexed Donetsk region, Murekezi said: I am very happy to be free. But I dont know what to do next. The Russians never gave me back my passport, and I feel trapped here. Murekezi spent most of his time in two different jails with a group of international foreign fighters, including the British nationals Aiden Aslin, John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy, who returned to the UK after a prisoner swap in September. But unlike the foreign fighters, Murekezi and his close friends and relatives said he did not participate in any fighting in Ukraine, to where he moved about four years ago, eventually settling in Kherson. \"It became clear early on to the Russian authorities that I had nothing to do with the fighting, but they just kept me in jail anyway,\" he said.

Contributor/Getty Images/FILE\n\nThe Russian leader said that the United States nuclear weapons were located in large numbers on European soil, while Russia had not transferred its nuclear weapons to other territories and is not planning to do so, but \"will protect its allies with all the means at its disposal, if necessary.\"\n\n\"We have not gone crazy. We are aware of what nuclear weapons are. We have these means, they are in a more advanced and modern form than those of any other nuclear country, this is obvious,\" he said. \"But we are not going to brandish these weapons like a razor, running around the world.\"\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Intercepted phone call reveals dwindling conditions for Russian forces 02:46 - Source: CNN\n\nSignificant result\n\nPutin also said there is no need for additional mobilization of Russian troops at this point, saying suggestions for more deployments \"simply do not make sense.\"\n\nOut of the 300,000 men called up for Russias partial mobilization, half are currently in Ukraine and of those, only 77,000 are in combat units while the rest are in defense forces or training, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in response to a question, he described Moscows territorial gains as a \"significant result for Russia.\"\n\nIn September, Putin announced the annexation of four Ukrainian regions Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in a process that violated international law.\n\nHowever, Russia currently controls only 60% of the southern Kherson region. It was forced to withdraw from the regional capital of Kherson city last month in a humiliating setback, though it still controls the coastline along the Sea of Azov.\n\n\"Lets be honest, the Sea of Azov has become an internal sea of the Russian Federation. All of this is a big deal,\" Putin said.\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, meanwhile, the United Nations nuclear watchdog has repeatedly warned of the risk of a nuclear accident at Ukraines largest nuclear plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant been rocked by explosions in recent months amid fighting nearby, with Kyiv and Moscow blaming each other for the attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson appeared to rule out proposals by the International Atomic Energy Agency to create a demilitarized zone around the plant, claiming it was on \"Russian territory and is fully controlled by Russia.\"\n\nWave of attacks\n\nPutins comments come as the war enters winter, with Russia continuing to shell eastern and southern parts of Ukraine and facing attacks on its own soil.\n\nEarlier this week, Russia unleashed a wave of drone and missile attacks across Ukraine, targeting the countrys energy infrastructure. Ukraine has been facing a wide assault on critical infrastructure and power sources since early October.\n\nThe recent strikes caused extensive power outages in several regions, including Kyiv and Odesa, leaving many households without electricity. Ukrainian repair teams have worked frantically to restore power across the country, but their efforts are being slowed by sub-zero temperatures and poor weather.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has accused Kyiv of using drones to strike military airfields far inside its territory on Monday and Tuesday an extraordinary breach of Moscows assumptions that it can protect its deep interior.\n\nUkraine has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the blasts, in keeping with Kyivs policy of official silence around attacks inside Russia or in Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nHowever, in an apparent reference to the strikes, an aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted cryptically that \"if something is launched into other countries airspace, sooner or later unknown flying objects will return to departure point.\"",

Karyi and his girlfriend watched the plumes of smoke from the doorstep of the cafe as Russia wiped out the energy to Kyivs residential left bank.\n\n\"It was a bit apocalyptic, but were from Kherson, so weve been through much worse,\" he said. The couple has been in business for two months after passing through 62 checkpoints while fleeing occupied Kherson, where they owned two cafes. In their new premises in Kyiv, Karyi passes out cups of filtered coffee and tea he makes with a camping stove. \"It slows things down. Ukrainians like espressos and cappuccinos, but this is all we can do now,\" he said.\n\nUkraines power supply is currently being held together with Band-Aids. Targeted Russian missile strikes have destroyed much of the countrys energy infrastructure, which plunged 6 million people into blackouts that lasted for days last month. Close to 50 percent of the countrys energy facilities have already been affected by Russian attacks, and the remaining 50 percent remain under constant threat of bombardment. Air raid sirens screamed across Kyiv this week to warn of incoming missile attacks. Some cities in Ukraine have managed to maintain a so-called normal power outage schedule of 4-hour blocks of power three times per day. But in other places, such as the eastern city of Kharkiv, blackouts can last for up to 12 hours per day.\n\nThe situation is not without irony. Earlier this year, Ukraines diverse energy supply was seen as a key to its resilience. Ukraines electricity sector was seen as a potential bulwark against Russian threats to squeeze Europe during the winter by restricting gas exports to the continent. In June, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine would start exporting electricity to the European Union via Romania. At the time, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said she was \"thrilled with Ukraines accomplishment, achieved while protecting their homeland, which will pave the way to what I know they can become: a clean energy powerhouse and energy exporter to the European Union.\"\n\nHowever, as Russian missiles continue to barrel through Ukraines energy infrastructure, Ukraine has become reliant on the EU for support to keep its hospitals, schools, and administration buildings afloat. The Energy Communityan organization that brings together the European Union and its neighbors to create an integrated, pan-European energy markethas stepped in to help Ukraine.\n\nThe groupin tandem with the European Commission and Ukraines Ministry of Energyset up a legal framework to counteract the impact of Russias invasion with a newly created Ukraine Energy Support Fund. Energy infrastructure that cant be received through donations can now be bought through the fund.\n\nBut financing is only one factor in Ukraines energy crisis. The large energy transformers destroyed in Russias attacks, which are crucial for maintaining Ukraines power supply, take at least six months to manufacture.\n\n\"The biggest needs at the moment are linked to the repair of high-voltage power transformers, which can be rarely found in Europe. The few that are available in Europe fall short of covering Ukraines needs,\" said Energy Community director Artur Lorkowski. \"So they will have to be manufactured, which will take a minimum of six months to 18 months, depending on their size and installed power. The transport of these transformers is also a large and complex logistical operation, consuming additional time and money.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Pavel Pavlishin, former chief of the Rivne Nuclear Power Plant, which provides 12 percent of Ukraines energy and 26 percent of the countrys nuclear energy, said further Russian strikes will be devastating for whats left of the countrys energy infrastructureincluding nuclear plants that pose a danger to the entire region.\n\n\"Its a complicated picture. Rivne, for example, provides power to both the east and the west, the major centers of Kyiv and Lviv,\" Pavlishin said. \"Worst case scenario for Rivne is if the plant does not receive the required energy, then we cant continue cooling the plant. We have gas-powered generators to pump water if this happens, but this is only for 10 days. After this period, the plant is in serious danger.\"\n\nMost people in Ukraines energy sector do not believe Russia would try to attack or seize any nuclear plants without ensuring it has access to energy to continue cooling. A government insider speaking on the condition of anonymity said: \"Russia isnt that stupid. They set up this infrastructure and know how it works. When they took Zaporizhzhia [nuclear power plant], they connected it to the Russia power grid. Annex the plants, yes, and starve Europe of a potential power supply, but theyre not stupid.\"\n\nAs winter temperatures steadily creep into the minus figures, Ukrainians struggle to survive. Anhelina, a 24-year-old from the Kyiv region, said she decided to move back into her parents home outside of Kyiv because living in her high-rise apartment building was no longer an option.\n\n\"Its definitely more difficult to live in a tall apartment complex than in my parents house. They have a fireplace. They have gas that still works. In many places in Ukraine, gas no longer works. I feel really privileged that I have the option to do this sort of off the grid living,\" she said. \"For people on the 20th floor like I was, it was really tough. The water is barely there. You can fill a bucket to wash, but the higher you get in a building, the less water pressure you get. People queue at the water shops and then try to bring the water up the elevators when we have power, but then you risk getting stuck in the elevator for four to eight hours when the power cuts.\"\n\nAs Anhelina struggles to continue her day-to-day life, gloomy predictions by Kyivs mayor, Vitali Klitschko, present a bleak future. The mayor recently warned citizens to ensure they had enough water, clothing, and foodstuffs to survive winter conditions. He encouraged those who can leave the city to go.\n\nFor people like Karyi, however, returning home isnt an option. The brief respite from darknessKherson residents had no power for several monthscame to an abrupt end due to Russian shelling. \"In Kherson, Russians tried to get us to take Russian documents to open our cafes. I was not going to do that, so we closed and hid our equipment so they wouldnt steal it,\" she said. \"Here, every strike means less electricity, more darkness. But at least its life without Russians. For that, Im happy.\"",

[] It is up to the Ukrainian people to decide for themselves under what conditions, how, when, not to us.\", the French president insisted.\n\nBiden, for his part, said he would only contact his Russian counterpart if he showed a willingness to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Im prepared if hes willing to talk to find out what hes willing to do,\" Biden said at a White House news conference following talks with Macron. \"But Ill only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. Im not going to do it on my own,\" he added.\n\nMacrons statement about security guarantees toward Russia confirms a EURACTIV report last month focusing on the balances within NATO.\n\nSource: US 'fortunately' keeps NATO moderate toward Russia The United States has \"fortunately\" managed to establish a moderate approach toward Russia within NATO despite calls for the opposite, a NATO source told EURACTIV. Some NATO members raised their reservations about the \"typical\" exchanges between Admiral Rob Bauer, NATOs chair\n\nNotably, a NATO source insisted that there is a group of eastern Europeans, Scandinavians, the UK, and former Yugoslavian countries backing a zero-sum approach on Russia, while traditional NATO members, such as the US, France, Turkey, Italy, and Greece are said to be more moderate in this regard.\n\nThe NATO source emphasised that \"fortunately\", Washington has taken the lead within NATO, and therefore a \"more moderate\" approach has prevailed, while for France, the source said it has come closer to the US position.\n\nThe report also suggested that some NATO members raised their reservations about the \"typical\" exchanges between Admiral Rob Bauer, NATOs chair of the Military Committee, and his Russian counterpart General Valery Gerasimov over mutual security, who reportedly agreed to \"be careful\", especially with ships not navigating in close proximity of each other in the Black Sea to avoid \"accidents\".\n\nRussias defence ministry reacted to EURACTIVs article, saying, \"Western media speculations about an alleged recent conversation between the Chief of the General Staff of Russias Armed Forces, General of the Army Valery Gerasimov, and the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, Rob Bauer, are fakes\".\n\n\"There was no such contact, let alone systematic, with the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee or other representatives of the North Atlantic Alliance within a non-existent Russian-American crisis commission for conflict resolution,\" the Defense Ministry said.\n\nIt added that the speculations about the conclusion of a certain agreement with Bauer regarding the safe movement of ships in the Black Sea were \"fictitious from beginning to end\".\n\n(Charles Szumski | EURACTIV.com Edited by Sarantis Michalopoulos)\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

                "cc_text": "The drone attack came a day after Ukraine appeared to launch attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. For Kyiv the strike represented an unprecedented operation to disrupt the Kremlin strategy of trying to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in a country on the verge of winter.\n\nA drone attack set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian regions governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border.\n\nDmytro Zhyvytsky, the governor of Sumy region on the Russian border, said several people were wounded when Russian forces fired 226 shells on seven communities during the day.\n\nShelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk Peoples Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republics Peoples Council, Maria Pirogova.\n\nA road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass.\n\nOleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional governor, said on Telegram that Russia launched drone and missile strikes on two villages overnight, injuring a 15-year-old girl and two other people. The Guardian has not been able to verify the reports independently.\n\nNatos secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to \"freeze\" the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are \"not there now\".\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said Russia will \"defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal\" and warned that the threat of nuclear war is \"on the rise\". In an address to his human rights council, Russias leader said his armys \"special military operation\" in Ukraine could be a \"long process\" , but he saw no need to mobilise additional soldiers at this point.\n\nUkraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 \"suspicious packages\" had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received \"bloody\" packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a \"campaign of terror and intimidation\".\n\nUkraines culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the countrys western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be \"pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion\".\n\nThe Kremlin said Vladimir Putin met senior officials on Tuesday to discuss \"domestic security\", and Russia was taking \"necessary\" measures to fend off more Ukrainian attacks. One of the attacks struck the key Engels airfield in the Saratov region, where Russia keeps some of its strategic nuclear bombers.\n\nThe Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was \"provocation towards our country\". The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Bidens request earlier this year.\n\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said it had not \"enabled\" Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. Kyiv did not directly claim responsibility but neither did it criticise the action, which killed three people and damaged long-range bombers and a fuel depot, according to reports from Russia.\n\nThe Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by Blinken about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks \"at the moment\". He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its \"special military operation\".\n\nBritain has ordered \"several thousand\" NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played \"a decisive role\" in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make.\n\nIran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Mykhailo Podolyak also told the Guardian that Russian forces had run short of their first batch of Iranian drones and only had enough of their own cruise missiles in their stockpile for \"two or three\" more mass strikes against Ukraine.\n\nBelarus plans to move military equipment and security forces on Wednesday and Thursday in what it says are checks on its response to possible acts of terrorism, the state Belta news agency reported. \"During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,\" the news agency cited the countrys security council as saying.\n\nPoland is preparing to deploy the German Patriot air defence system on its territory, after Berlin refused to place the system in Ukraine, Polands defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said on Twitter. Germany last month offered Poland the Patriot system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland.\n\nEurope is likely to scrape through this winter without cutting off gas customers despite reduced Russian supplies, but even adjusting to colder homes and paying more may not be enough in coming years, analysts have told AFP. Russias progressive reduction of gas supplies to Europe via pipeline triggered a bidding war for liquefied natural gas (LNG), sending prices sharply higher.\n\nAt least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UNs human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited troops close to frontlines in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Addressing service personnel later in the presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said he had spent the day with troops in Donbas, theatre of the heaviest battles, and in Kharkiv region, where Ukrainians have retaken swaths of territory from Russian forces.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from \"Kyiv-controlled territory\". Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, Andrii Yermak, Ukraines presidential chief of staff, said.\n\nUkraines health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts.\n\nRussian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking \"all measures\" to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europes largest, in the face of what he called \"nuclear terrorism\" from Kyiv.\n\nRussias defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan.\n\nA US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers.",

                "cc_text": "Text Also Approved on International Year of Dialogue as Guarantee of Peace, 2023\n\nThree decades since it created the United Nations humanitarian system, the General Assembly today adopted four resolutions to bolster a beleaguered relief apparatus struggling to help nearly 400 million people facing severe crises around the planet, as well as a text on the culture of peace.\n\nIn opening remarks, Csaba Krsi (Hungary), President of the General Assembly, said a meeting on strengthening the coordination of emergency and humanitarian assistance of the United Nations could not come at a more fitting moment, as the world today is in a permanent state of humanitarian crisis. \"We are breaking all the wrong records,\" he said.\n\nReferring to the Global Humanitarian Overview 2023 issued last week by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, he said the world is facing the highest number of violent conflicts since 1945 and 399 million people, the highest number ever, need humanitarian assistance. \"Statistics are the human beings with the tears wiped off,\" he said, adding that this powerful image shows families, including children, the elderly and women, behind the statistics. \"They are all of us.\"\n\nUnderscoring 2022 as the thirty-first anniversary of Assembly resolution 46/182 (1991), he urged Member States to act on this sessions drafts to ensure a culture of transformational change. The Central Emergency Response Fund is one of the fastest ways to scale up and provide sustained relief operations, he added, when no other funding is available.\n\nThe Assembly then adopted the four humanitarian resolutions without a vote.\n\nIn adopting the 19-page resolution \"Strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations\", the Assembly reaffirms the principles of its landmark resolution 46/182 of December 1991, encouraging the international community to support Member States efforts to prepare for disasters. The text also encourages the development of multi-hazard warning systems and recognition of the Central Emergency Response Funds achievements.\n\nAligning himself with the European Union, the representative of Sweden introduced the draft, which he said equips the humanitarian community with the necessary framework to deliver assistance. The text introduces important language on climate change, cash assistance, safety and security of humanitarian personnel, need to narrow the humanitarian funding gap and strengthen partnerships with international financial institutions. \"We, as Member States of the United Nations, need to translate the words of the resolution into concrete action to save lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity across the globe.\"\n\nAccording to the resolution \"International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development\", the Assembly recognizes the relationship between emergency response, rehabilitation and development, as well as the need to ensure a smooth transition between the three stages.\n\nThe delegate of Pakistan, speaking on behalf of the \"Group of 77\" developing countries and China, introduced that draft, stressing the importance of assisting countries and people affected by natural disasters. Underlining the importance of early action to minimize the impact of natural disasters, the draft recognizes the special financial needs of countries facing compound risks caused by humanitarian emergencies, natural disasters and climate change, he said.\n\nBy the terms of the resolution \"Assistance to the Palestinian people\", the Assembly underlines the importance of emergency and humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip and the need to advance its reconstruction. The text calls on the international community to provide urgently needed assistance and services to ease the difficult humanitarian situation faced by Palestinian women, children and their families and help reconstruct and develop relevant Palestinian institutions.\n\nIntroducing the resolution, the representative of the Czech Republic, speaking for the European Union, expressed concern over the difficult humanitarian situation affecting Palestinians throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly the Gaza Strip. He called for full, unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza, noting that the European Union will keep contributing to Gazas development through investments in reforms, support to economic sectors and work in the water and energy sectors. The bloc expects that Israel will facilitate such efforts, he said.\n\nThe Permanent Observer for the State of Palestine said there is no effective humanitarian response without a political response, underscoring the importance of delivering international action and promoting peaceful settlement to end the humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nBy the terms of the fourth resolution, \"Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel\", the Assembly strongly condemned all acts of violence, attacks and threats against humanitarian, as well as United Nations and associated personnel. The text also calls upon States to explore and scale up measures for more systematic monitoring, reporting and investigation of attacks against humanitarian and medical personnel.\n\nThe Czech Republics delegate, who also introduced this draft, on behalf of the European Union, said instability, armed conflict and climate change have created the greatest need for humanitarian assistance in decades. As humanitarian personnel face high risks to meet these needs, the international community has the moral obligation to mitigate this risk.. He noted two worrying trends that emerged in 2022: disinformation campaigns that undermine trust in the United Nations and humanitarian organizations and put their personnel at risk; and the negative impact on mental health and psychosocial well-being faced by nationally and locally recruited personnel.\n\nDelegates also emphasized the need for greater coordination, stronger frameworks and financing to meet the escalating humanitarian needs of the planets people.\n\n\"The system is under water,\" said Switzerlands delegate, noting that expanding humanitarian needs are overwhelming the system and that the current trajectory is unsustainable. The Assembly can help the United Nations system provide a more coordinated response with resolutions laying down the regulatory framework. A more proactive approach is needed to reduce the impact of certain shocks, such as climate change. \"We are speaking of attitudes here,\" she said. \"It is urgent to change the entire mindset of humanitarian work.\"\n\nThe representative of Brunei Darussalam, speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said that improving disaster management, risk and response capabilities is essential to build resilient communities and reach the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world, ASEAN is expanding its practices on disaster risk reduction and management and emergency response. Speaking also on behalf of Sweden, Indias representative expressed commitment to preserving the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence in responding to all humanitarian situations. She called the $51.5 billion needed to help 230 million of the worlds most vulnerable people, as cited in the Global Humanitarian Review 2023, a formidable challenge for the entire international community, but highlighted encouraging improvements in data collection and flexible instruments like the Central Emergency Response Fund and Country-Based Pool Funds.\n\nThe observer for the Sovereign Order of Malta said the United Nations is the last best hope to energize will and power to break through differences and put the needs of the sick, poor and marginalized at the centre. \"If all of us expand our collective collaboration with UN aid agencies and related bodies, we can be on the right side of history and continue to earn the respect of those who are, tragically, on the wrong side of the economic divide,\" he said.\n\nThe Assembly then turned to its agenda item on \"Culture of Peace\", adopting without a vote the resolution \"International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace, 2023\". Introducing the resolution, the representative of Turkmenistan said it was a product of comprehensive consultations, reflecting the main principles of the United Nations Charter to settle disputes by peaceful means and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\n\nAlso speaking today were representatives of Maldives, Qatar, Iran, Belarus, Poland, Philippines, Egypt, China, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Australia, United States, Russian Federation, Norway, Thailand, Canada, Romania, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Trkiye, Morocco, Chile, Kuwait, Sudan, France, Ukraine and Bangladesh, as well as the European Union.\n\nThe representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) also delivered a statement.\n\nThe Assembly will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 December, to consider the reports of the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) and at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 December, to consider the reports of the Sixth Committee (Legal) and then take up the issue of cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations.\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nCSABA KRSI (Hungary), President of the General Assembly, said a meeting on strengthening the coordination of emergency and humanitarian assistance of the United Nations could not come at a more fitting moment, as the world today is in a permanent state of humanitarian crises. \"We are breaking all the wrong records,\" he said. The 2023 global humanitarian overview outlines this situation in stark terms, noting the highest number of violent conflicts since 1945 and 399 million people, the highest number ever, in need of humanitarian assistance. Pointing to worlds highest numbers of people at risk of hunger and forcibly displaced, he added that increases in gender-based violence and sexual harassment are especially alarming. \"Statistics are the human beings with the tears wiped off,\" he said, adding that this powerful image shows the families, including children, the elderly and women, behind the statistics. \"They are all of us.\"\n\nThe Assembly and Member States simply must do better, he said, as many people will be unable to survive the days ahead. \"Every Member State must be distressed,\" he added, referring to killings, kidnappings and arbitrary detainments. On this date, the thirtyfirst anniversary of the resolution 46/182 (1991), which created the Organizations humanitarian system, he urged the Assembly to act on this years drafts to strengthen its response. The draft resolutions are necessary to ensure a culture of transformational change. The Central Emergency Response Fund is one of the fastest ways to scale up and provide sustained relief operations, when no other funding is available, he said, adding that investment in the Fund embodies this spirit of transformation. All groups, including civil society and the private sector, must work together and develop innovative practices to improve coordination and recovery efforts.\n\nIntroduction of Draft Resolutions\n\nMAGNUS LENNARTSSON ( Sweden ), aligning himself with the European Union, introduced the draft resolution titled \"Strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations\" (document A/77/L.30). Noting that his country has facilitated negotiations of the text since landmark General Assembly resolution 46/182 which created the foundations of todays United Nations humanitarian system was adopted in 1991, he said the current draft equips the humanitarian community with the framework it needs to provide such assistance. The text introduces important language on climate change, cash assistance, safety and security of humanitarian personnel, the need to narrow the humanitarian funding gap and strengthen partnerships with international financial institutions, and accountability to affected populations. Encouraging consensus adoption, he said that \"we, as Member States of the United Nations, must hold ourselves accountable by translating the words of the resolution into concrete action to save lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity across the globe.\"\n\nMOHAMMAD AAMIR KHAN ( Pakistan ), speaking on behalf of the \"Group of 77\" developing countries and China, introduced the draft resolution on \"International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development\" (document A/77/L.32) and stressed the importance of providing assistance to countries and people affected by natural disasters. The draft recognizes a relationship between emergency response, rehabilitation and development as well as the need to ensure a smooth transition between the three stages, he observed. Further, it emphasizes that emergency assistance must ensure long-term support to affected countries. This year, the text contains new paragraphs that aim to further strengthen humanitarian assistance, prevention, preparedness, response and recovery efforts to help minimize the loss of lives and damage caused by natural disasters. The draft encourages efforts to identify best practices to ensure humanitarian response and mitigate the humanitarian impact of natural disasters, he stressed, pointing to increased efforts to prevent famine, food insecurity and malnutrition related to natural disasters. It also incorporates mental health support services into disaster response and recovery. Underlining the importance of early action, with a view to minimizing the impact of natural disasters, the draft recognizes the special financial needs of countries facing compound risks caused by humanitarian emergencies, natural disasters and climate change, he stressed.\n\nJAKUB KULHNEK ( Czech Republic ), speaking for the European Union, next introduced the draft resolution titled \"Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel\" (document A/77/L.35). Pointing out that humanitarian needs continued to grow in 2022, he said that instability, armed conflict and climate change have created the greatest need for humanitarian assistance in decades. United Nations and humanitarian personnel are facing high risks to meet these needs, and the international community has the moral obligation to mitigate this risk as much as possible.\n\nHe went on to note that two worrying trends have emerged in 2022, the first being disinformation campaigns that undermine trust in the United Nations and humanitarian organizations and put their personnel at risk. The second is the negative impact on mental health and psychosocial well-being faced by nationally and locally recruited personnel. The resolution notes these concerns, he said, welcoming it as a consensual document reflecting a common commitment to humanitarian action. He stressed that those risking their lives to help others deserve the General Assemblys support.\n\nHe then introduced the draft resolution titled \"Assistance to the Palestinian people\" (document A/77/L.34), expressing concern over the difficult humanitarian situation affecting Palestinians throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly the Gaza Strip. The European Union deplores the continuing risk of demolition and seizure of Palestinian structures in the occupied West Bank, he said, calling on Israel to allow for a tangible improvement in the freedom of movement and living conditions for those living there. The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains a grave concern and, while welcoming the easing of some restrictions, he called for full, unimpeded humanitarian access.\n\nThe European Union will continue to contribute to Gazas development through investments in reforms, support to economic sectors and work in the water and energy sectors and the bloc expects that Israel will facilitate such efforts, he said. Underscoring that a fundamental change of the situation in Gaza is necessary to ensure lasting results, he called on all parties to take urgent steps towards this end pursuant to Security Council resolution 2334 (2016). He added that this includes an end to the closure policy, the full opening of crossing points and the provision of full humanitarian access, while addressing Israels legitimate security concerns.\n\nHe next turned to the agenda item \"Strengthening of international cooperation and coordination of efforts to study, mitigate and minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster\". He recalled that, 36 years ago, the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant caused by the Soviet Unions reckless policies regarding nuclear safety spelled widespread consequences for Ukraine and other countries in the region. Europe was among the first to respond to that disaster and assist Ukraine, expending more than 1 billion (about $1 billion) in grants and loans to ensure safe containment of the No.4 reactor, effective radioactive-waste management and assistance to affected regions. The European Union will continue to focus its nuclear-safety-related assistance on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, where estimated damage caused by Russian troops 83,939,963.76 including to a lab originally provided by the bloc amounts to 80 million (about $83,923,487.9).\n\nRecalling that the tragedy at Chernobyl triggered a strong response from the international community, he underscored a need for the same today to support Ukraine. He urged the consideration of new, legally binding international rules to prohibit armed attacks against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes, noting that nuclear safety in Ukraine is again in jeopardy due to the Russian Federations unprovoked, unjustified war of aggression. He urged Moscow to immediately withdraw from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and return control thereof to the legitimate Ukrainian authorities in full respect of Ukraines sovereignty, independent and territorial integrity.\n\nStatements\n\nNOOR QAMAR SULAIMAN ( Brunei Darussalam ), speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), commended efforts of the Office of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) as well as all humanitarian workers. Her region is one of the most disaster-prone in the world, she said, noting that ASEAN is further strengthening its practices on disaster risk reduction and management and emergency response, including through the operationalization of ASEAN Vision 2025 on Disaster Management, which aims to mobilize greater resources and establish stronger coordination. Further, the first ASEAN Disaster Resilience Platform was convened in June 2022, she said, stressing the need for a holistic, cross-pillar and cross-sectoral approach.\n\nHighlighting the blocs cooperation with partners and other stakeholders, she welcomed the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between ASEAN and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) on the Strengthening of Community Resilience in Southeast Asia in May 2022. Noting the upcoming high-level meeting, in May 2023, of the Assembly on the midterm review of the implementation of the Sendai Framework, she emphasized that improving disaster management and risk and response capabilities is essential in building resilient societies and communities as well as to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nMs. SCHEUER ( Switzerland ) said global humanitarian needs are increasing every year, overwhelming the humanitarian system. \"The system is under water,\" she said, adding that the current trajectory is unsustainable. The only solution is to address root causes of crisis, including conflicts, forced displacement and epidemics. The Assembly can help the United Nations system provide a more coordinated response, she stressed, noting that these resolutions provide the regulatory framework. More support and financing should be given to local actors, who are the first responders. International humanitarian law must be upheld to ensure access for responders and a more proactive approach is needed to reduce the impact of certain shocks, such as climate change. \"We are speaking of attitudes here,\" she said. \"It is urgent to change the entire mindset of humanitarian work.\"\n\nHUSSAIN A. MOHAMED HUSSAIN ( Maldives ), noting that 90 per cent of refugees come from countries that are among the most vulnerable and the least ready to adapt to climate change, pointed out that by 2050, approximately 1 billion people are projected to be at risk from coastal-specific climate hazards. His country, where most of the land area is less than one metre above sea level, is already suffering the impact of coastal erosion, frequent monsoon flooding and intense sea surges. Pointing to the record-breaking rains in Pakistan as well as the catastrophic loss caused by hurricanes Fiona and Ian in North and Central America, he added that across the Horn of Africa, humanitarian emergencies caused by acute drought have affected an approximate 36.1 million people. Applauding the establishment of a loss and damage fund for vulnerable countries at the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in Sharm elSheikh, he also emphasized the need for finalizing and implementing a multidimensional vulnerability index.\n\nABDULAZIZ F. A. AL THANI ( Qatar ), spotlighting Qatars leading role in humanitarian aid and assistance, said his country recently donated $12 billion to the Horn of Africa and announced $20 million to support African countries in accessing food exports from Ukraine. In providing multi-year, non-earmarked aid for the United Nations agencies, Qatar has worked closely with strategic partners, including OCHA and committed to supporting the Central Emergency Response Fund with $2 million for 2022-2023. It has also provided humanitarian aid and assistance to the Palestinian people, including the signing of a multi-year agreement with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in 2018. Going forward, Qatar will continue to provide development aid and assistance, support United Nations agencies and cooperate on humanitarian affairs, he pledged.\n\nZAHRA ERSHADI ( Iran ) voiced concern over the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine and Yemen, including the massive influx of displaced Afghans to neighbouring countries. She stressed that humanitarian crises must not lead to foreign intervention, including under the pretext of the responsibility to protect. While West Asia is prone to a variety of disasters, such as earthquakes, droughts and floods, Iran has suffered tremendously from the additional weight of unlawful and illegal unilateral sanctions. On the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, she stressed that, as winter approaches and the situation of the Afghan people especially women, girls and children continues to deteriorate, the timely provision of humanitarian assistance and release of Afghanistans frozen assets should in no way be politicized. To tackle environmental challenges in West Asia, Iran with agencies related to the United Nations will convene an International Conference on Combating Sand and Dust Storms in 2023, she said.\n\nMr. AMBRAZEVICH ( Belarus ) said that his country is doing everything possible to assist nations facing humanitarian crises. Over the past 20 years, Belarus has participated in 76 humanitarian missions to 32 countries and, in November, prepared shipments to be sent to Syria and Pakistan. Turning to the Chernobyl disaster, he said that its consequences for Belarus were comparable with the destruction caused by the Second World War. International solidarity to respond to this disaster represented a \"shining example\" of diplomacy and dedicated, depoliticized international cooperation, he noted, stating that the people of Belarus will never forget this aid. Now, Belarus has evolved from a recipient country to a full-pledged humanitarian partner and is willing to share its expertise in addressing large-scale, anthropogenic disasters. He added a call for international cooperation regarding Chernobyl to continue in the spirit of coordination and partnership, urging that the issue not serve as a platform for manipulation or exacerbation of confrontation.\n\nKAROLINA KRUPA, Director of the Development Cooperation Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland , said that, since 24 February, one of the biggest humanitarian crises since Second World War has been unfolding in the territory of its immediate neighbour, Ukraine. Just hours later, the Polish Government began assisting Ukrainian civilians who were forced to move from peace to war overnight. Some 77 per cent of Poles have been involved in various kinds of assistance for Ukraine and its people, who found refuge in Polish territory. She stressed that the international communitys overall humanitarian response must be coordinated and coherent, and concrete actions and innovations prioritized, with respect for international humanitarian law. For Poland, respect for international humanitarian law, international law, human principles and accountability are core rules that make the humanitarian system reliable for civilians who find themselves in conflict zones.\n\nBJRN OLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, reiterated the commitment of its member States in protecting humanitarian space and deterring violations of international humanitarian law. Continued violations lead to massive assistance and protection needs for civilians and prevent vital assistance from reaching those in need. As principled humanitarian actors and medical workers must never be targets, perpetrators must be held accountable, he said. In expressing his concern over the rise of information manipulation which can undermine trust in humanitarian organizations and place their personnel at serious risk, he called on States and parties to conflict to prevent disinformation. To ensure that humanitarian space remains open for all necessary aid to reach those in need, States must undertake mitigating measures to prevent any potentially negative impact of sanctions and counter-terrorism measures on humanitarian activities. Accountability measures, he continued, must take a survivor-centred approach and avoid retraumatizing those who have already suffered harm.\n\nTurning his attention to the unprecedented global food crisis which has been exacerbated by climate change and conflict, he called for urgent action to keep famine at bay. With no time to lose, the European Union has increased its humanitarian food assistance by 64 per cent since 2020 and has allocated 8 billion to the Team Europe Response to Global Food Insecurity until 2024. Others must step up too, he urged as he outlined the need for atscale multi-sectoral solutions, holistic responses which address root causes and the front-loading of funding to enable early response and investments in sustainable solutions that build community resilience. The donor base for humanitarian action must be expanded, he added. \"Helping the most vulnerable people around the world is a shared responsibility and we need to see a much broader group of countries contributing to humanitarian funding,\" he stressed.\n\nANTONIO M. A. LAGDAMEO ( Philippines ) spotlighted his countrys experiences with disasters to underscore the importance of humanitarian resolutions. Anticipatory action can reduce the impact of crises, he noted as he highlighted his countrys development plan to manage multi-dimensional risks from natural disasters and pandemics. As information and communications technology (ICT) also has a critical role in risk assessment, disaster risk reduction and the provision of humanitarian assistance, States must bridge the divide including through technology transfers. The Philippines, he noted, will continue to strengthen its multi-hazard, impact-based forecasting and early warning action systems to develop rights-based and gender-responsive social protection programmes. Turning his attention to the plight of migrants, he called on all States to fully respect international human rights law and international humanitarian law, ensure the lawful provision of assistance and account for such populations in crisis preparedness, emergency response and post-crisis action.\n\nAHMED MOHAMED E A ELSHANDAWILY ( Egypt ) raised concern over the unprecedented increase in humanitarian assistance over the course of the last year, in addition to the adverse impact of climate change. Warning against the continuous impact of the COVID19 pandemic, he stressed the need to take expedited measures to tackle food insecurity, enhance international cooperation and avoid a spike in humanitarian aid. The international community must take effective measures to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of people who are still facing crises, he said, stressing the importance of protecting civilians. In this context, he called for political solutions and investments in capacity-building to create an environment conducive to sustainable development. The principles of humanitarian work including impartiality, independence and non-interference in internal affairs must be respected, he asserted, supporting all efforts to end conflicts and alleviate human suffering.\n\nMOHAMMED ABDULAZIZ H. ALATEEK ( Saudi Arabia ) said the coordination of humanitarian assistance is one of the General Assemblys most important agenda items, at a time when the world is still recovering from the economic and health impacts of the pandemic. It is incumbent on the international community to respond to the unprecedented number of crises. The 2023 global humanitarian plan launched last week shows that 399 million people in 69 States need assistance and that the cost will reach $51.5 billion, up 25 per cent over 2022. As one of the largest international humanitarian donors, Saudi Arabia considers such aid one of its most important priorities. The third Riyadh International Humanitarian Forum will be held in Saudi Arabia in February 2023, providing an important platform to coordinate international humanitarian responses. Strategic planning, based on scientific principles, is also needed, as is protected and safe access for humanitarian workers. He said the Saudi Government has responded to humanitarian emergencies around the world, including donations of $10 million to Pakistan; more than $18 billion to Yemen; and $5.2 billion to the Palestinian cause.\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ) called on the international community to strengthen solidarity and cooperation, which should adhere to humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law, respect the sovereignty of recipient countries, avoid interference in internal affairs and prevent the politicization and instrumentalization of humanitarian issues. The protection of vulnerable groups should be strengthened and unilateral coercive measures lifted at an early date to avoid exacerbating already dire situations, he added. He called on donors to increase their assistance, close the funding gap, respond to all humanitarian crises without discrimination and provide a particular helping hand to African countries. The international community, he continued, must combine short-term assistance with long-term development, increase development assistance and ensure a smooth transition from relief to development. It must also increase assistance to developing countries to enhance their capacities in disaster prevention and reduction. Developed countries must accelerate their support through funds, technologies and means, earnestly fulfilling their historical responsibility and international obligations to address climate change, he urged.\n\nMATTHEW CHAN ( Singapore ), associating himself with ASEAN, emphasized the need for the United Nations system to adapt quickly to new and emerging challenges on disaster risk and management. Although the ASEAN region has experienced an increased frequency of natural disasters with catastrophic consequences, he stressed, \"it is not too late to take decisive action\". There must be greater investment in resilience-building and early warning since prevention is significantly cheaper. As a small island developing State which faces the existential threat of sea level rise, Singapore has developed a costal-inland flood model to assess food risks and established a dedicated fund to finance the construction of drainage infrastructure and coastal protection measures. Partnerships with non-State actors to build resilience must be strengthened and technology to better predict disasters must be harnessed, he stressed. All Member States must work with and through the United Nations to build the resilience of the most vulnerable, he urged.\n\nMOHD ABDULRAHMAN MOHAMED JALIL SULTAN ALOLAMA ( United Arab Emirates ) stressed that humanitarian aid should be provided based on principles free of any religious, racial or political considerations. Describing prevention as the most cost-effective investment to protect humanity and improve adaptations to climate change by mitigating its effects, he urged the United Nations bodies to step up their actions and strengthen links with local communities in emergency responses, ensuring the participation of women. This strategy will facilitate access of entire populations to aid, especially the most vulnerable, he noted, commending the work of first responders to humanitarian crises. Reaffirming the common responsibility to take necessary measures to prevent local conflicts, he said the United Arab Emirates will continue to work closely with Member States, United Nations agencies and other stakeholders to provide a collective response to growing humanitarian needs worldwide.\n\nFIONA WEBSTER ( Australia ) said that, in 2023, the world will continue to face compounding challenges, including rising food insecurity, protracted conflicts, record levels of displacement and the impacts of climate change. This will require continued and increased humanitarian assistance, she said, while stressing that such assistance alone is not the solution. The international community must facilitate political solutions and hold warring parties to account for violations of international humanitarian law. Further, it must invest in a multi-hazard, cross-sectoral approach to disaster risk reduction, preparedness and resilience-building, while ensuring that gender equality, disability inclusion and localization are at the centre of such efforts. She added that, as the Asia-Pacific region is the most disaster-prone region in the world, her country was proud to host the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Brisbane in September.\n\nSAMUEL VIGERSKY ( United States ) said the world is facing an unprecedented crisis of food insecurity, as countries reel from hunger and malnutrition caused by the COVID19 pandemic, climate change and the Russian Federations illegal war against Ukraine. Families are facing impossible choices, as they are forced to decide which child to feed, wondering whether they will survive. The United States is stepping up on all fronts to meet urgent global challenges as the largest single humanitarian donor. It has provided $17 billion in humanitarian assistance in fiscal year 2022 and, since the Russian Federation launched its premeditated, unprovoked invasion in February, it has provided more than $1.5 billion in assistance to support displaced persons in Ukraine and the region. Further, it has committed nearly $11 billion since the invasion began to address the global food-security crisis. He went on to note that his country is also providing more than $2 billion in assistance for drought response in the Horn of Africa for fiscal year 2022, as well as being the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Detailing the pernicious effects of conflict on humanitarian actors, he underscored the need to promote accountability consistent with international humanitarian law across all conflicts.\n\nDMITRY S. CHUMAKOV ( Russian Federation ) said the Assembly was able to obtain consensus on three humanitarian resolutions this year, despite differing approaches, expressing hope this process will continue. Global humanitarian needs are alarming, with 399 million people needing help and a record amount of aid $55.1 billion required, he said, stressing that donor participation is more important than ever. The Russian Federation normally contributes through bilateral channels and entities in the United Nations system. Yet this year, the country has been subjected to a record number of sanctions by the United States and the European Union that have limited its ability to provide assistance. In 2021, before sanctions were imposed, the Russian Federation provided official development assistance (ODA) of $1.2 billion. He called on the Secretariat to seek solutions to this problem and for involved parties to understand how their responses are undermining humanitarian work. He disagreed with statements that the Russian Federation has triggered the global food and security crisis. As a producer of fertilizer and food, his country is motivated to expand its exports and create stable food markets,\n\nODD INGE KVALHEIM ( Norway ), voicing concern over the increasing level of global food insecurity, stressed the need for strengthened humanitarian assistance and protection. The protection of civilians including children has been a defining aspect of Norways tenure as an elected Security Council member, he noted before calling on all States to endorse and implement the Safe Schools Declaration. Turning to the need to work smarter and better, he said innovative solutions will be key to closing the growing gap between humanitarian needs and resources, improve responses and ultimately ensure better protection for people affected by conflict. In light of the need to reinforce local humanitarian action and ensure better accountability, Norway will continue to push for reforms which place the needs of people at the centre. He then called for closer collaboration between humanitarian efforts, long-term development assistance and peacebuilding; a stronger connection with climate change adaptation and prevention, including through finance for climate-robust food production; and increased anticipatory action.\n\nASYA THANCHITT ( Thailand ), aligning herself with ASEAN, stressed the need to further strengthen efforts to prevent, prepare for and address challenges at the local, national and regional levels. Humanitarian assistance must reach those in critical need in accordance with humanitarian principles and full respect for international humanitarian law, she stressed. As the COVID19 pandemic has demonstrated that health services are vital components in humanitarian relief efforts, Member States must work to advance universal health coverage and ensure essential health services and public health functions in emergencies. Coordination between health and disaster risk management sectors must increase, and medical personnel must have necessary protection and support, she added. She then emphasized the need to build the capacity of countries and relevant actors to prepare for and respond to natural hazards by strengthening the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.\n\nSHIRLEY ONG ( Canada ), noting that the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance climbed during 2022 to reach a staggering 324 million, voiced concern over the proliferation of armed conflicts worldwide. Moscows deplorable attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure have precipitated unprecedented rates of forced displacement in Europe, contributing to global food insecurity and a malnutrition crisis. Globally, forced displacement surpassed 100 million people, she said, adding that more than 300 million people need clean water, emergency medicine, shelter and food. Hundreds of millions are experiencing hunger, in some cases at catastrophic levels, she cautioned, pointing to the situations in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Haiti, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. Highlighting her countrys humanitarian priorities, she stressed the need to mobilize all possible resources, including those already in place. Further, she called for reinforcing the critical role of local and national actors, including women-led and refugee-led organizations, who are on the front lines of humanitarian responses. Drawing attention to the many underfunded humanitarian crises around the world including in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel she stressed that \"suffering is suffering, no matter where it is\". To protect the most vulnerable during armed conflict, Canada endorsed the Political Declaration on protecting civilians from the effects of armed conflict in populated areas, signed on 18 November in Dublin.\n\nANDREEA MOCANU ( Romania ), aligning herself with the European Union, said that 2022 was profoundly marked by the humanitarian crisis caused by the Russian Federations brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. To respond to the staggering number of people in need, Romania swiftly dispatched humanitarian assistance to provide relief to the most vulnerable among those affected by the war, and, most recently, it has consolidated its support for Ukraine during the winter months. A voluntary contribution of 300,000 is being disbursed, and Romania will also host a modular temporary shelter that will be fully equipped and ensure accommodation for up to 16,000 refugees. Also pointing out that the Russian Federations unlawful war triggered a record crisis in the neighbouring country of Moldova, she said that her country has contributed around 10.5 million in response. Detailing additional humanitarian assistance provided by her country, she added that Romania has joined international efforts to address food insecurity generated by Moscows aggression, as more than 8.5 million tons of Ukrainian agricultural products have transited Romania to reach countries in need.\n\nCAROLYN SCHWALGER ( New Zealand ), stressing the need to ensure the safety of humanitarian actors, noted the soaring demand for their assistance, driven by the compounding effects of the COVID19 pandemic and climate change as well as the lack of political will to prevent and end armed conflict. \"The warnings are clear: unless we can forge political solutions, next year food supplies could be tighter,\" she emphasized, commending the Black Sea Grain Initiative as an example of what can be achieved through talking rather than fighting. Turning to her countrys advocacy for women and girls in all their diversity, she stressed that their sexual and reproductive rights must be upheld in all contexts. Without this, gender equality and womens empowerment simply cannot be achieved. She then underscored the effects of climate change in driving and magnifying humanitarian needs, emphasizing the value of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, anticipatory action and emergency preparedness.\n\nJAMES KARIUKI ( United Kingdom ), calling for a shared vision and collaborative political will, said his country will use limited resources effectively by ensuring that humanitarian responses are accountable, data-driven and cost-effective. Digital cash transfers, he noted, are an effective and dignified way to deliver assistance, which his Government will champion and scale up. The United Kingdom, he continued, will uphold international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law by utilizing its position as a Council member to enable unhindered access to those in need, ensure accountability for those who violate humanitarian principles and the United Nations Charter in Ukraine, and bolster support to local, women-led organizations. To prevent todays problems from turning into tomorrows crises, his country will also leverage its networks to deepen early warning expertise, promote innovation and strengthen systems to prevent and anticipate shocks. Using its position on the boards of international financial institutions to unlock financing for these efforts, the United Kingdom will also continue to push for increased access to climate finance in climate-vulnerable countries.\n\nCEREN HANDE ZGR ( Trkiye ), calling for sufficient, predictable and sustained humanitarian assistance, noted that her country is doing its part as the second largest donor. As humanitarian aid must reach those in need through the most direct routes, efforts to ensure access to critical services and assistance must be guided solely by humanitarian considerations and not be politicized. She then reiterated her countrys support for renewal of the mandate for the United Nations cross-border humanitarian assistance mechanism for Syria, pledged its continued support to the Black Sea Grain Initiative and emphasized the need for humanitarian assistance to account for and act upon emerging risks and trends. The dignity, humane treatment, well-being and rights of migrants and refugees must be upheld as a moral and legal obligation for States, she continued. As the largest refugee hosting country, Trkiye also calls for greater solidarity as well as predictable and equitable responsibility sharing, she said, before expressing her support for UNRWA.\n\nOMAR HILALE ( Morocco ), stressing that the international community is facing a myriad of challenges that have exacerbated humanitarian needs, said humanitarian actors are struggling daily to respond not only to crises that are related to armed conflicts, but extreme climate events, including droughts, earthquakes and tsunamis. The impact of climate change, ranging from food insecurity to forced displacement, as well as the COVID19 pandemic and its direct and indirect impacts, is affecting the most vulnerable, particularly women and children. Early warning systems must cover multiple risks, he said, calling for flexible financing combined with climate forecasting. He underscored that alarming food insecurity and the risk of famine require a global coordinated response through humanitarian action that is in synergy with efforts for development and peacebuilding. To alleviate the suffering of the most vulnerable populations, he called for a diversified system of humanitarian partnerships, including Member States and the United Nations as well as international and regional humanitarian organizations. He also urged for greater mobilization by the international community to guarantee the security of medical and humanitarian staff.\n\nCARMEN NISHIHARA ( Chile ) expressed concern over escalating violence, especially that present in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian armed groups in the Gaza Strip. Noting that the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people increase every year, reflecting the gravity of economic and health crises faced by those in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, she underscored the need to provide assistance on the ground and increase resources available to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). She went on to stress that the disproportionate use of force has resulted in the loss of thousands of lives, and the indiscriminate use of violence against civilians is unacceptable. She called on both parties to abide by their obligations to protect civilians, also underlining the need to seek a lasting, just and sustainable solution. Chile will continue working to achieve two independent States with secure, internationally recognized borders, she said, reiterating her countrys support for Palestinians right to an independent country.\n\nRAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI ( India ), speaking also on behalf of Sweden, said the primary responsibility for providing protection and assistance in a humanitarian crisis lies with the concerned country and its national Government. Yet, when provided, international humanitarian assistance must be given impartially, according to guiding principles of relevant Assembly resolutions. India and Sweden remain committed to preserving the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence in responding to all humanitarian situations. Respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter, including sovereignty, political independence and the territorial integrity of Member States, should remain the basis for all humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe latest Global Humanitarian Overview report, released just a few days ago, gives details of humanitarian challenges facing the world, calling for $51.5 billion to bring life-saving support to 230 million of the worlds most vulnerable people. \"This is a formidable challenge for the entire international community, and one we cannot afford to downplay,\" he said. One encouraging indicator is that data collection has improved and flexible instruments like the Central Emergency Response Fund and Country-Based Pool Funds allow for the quick re-direction of resources to address the most acute needs. The private sector is increasingly stepping in as a strong and creative partner to traditional humanitarian actors. Moving forward, he urged the international community to look beyond immediate relief and rehabilitation and promote disaster resilience infrastructure through the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. The Coalitions membership has expanded to include 30 countries and seven multilateral organizations, he noted.\n\nMr. AL AJMI ( Kuwait ) underlined the importance of giving priority to humanitarian action, noting that precepts of the Muslim religion lead to extending a friendly hand to those who most need it. He reiterated the need for strengthening and coordinating human assistance and relief provided by the United Nations in the event of disasters and crisis. Turning to the report of the Secretary-General, he lamented the number of people who have fled their homes, including in the context of the COVID19 pandemic. Recalling violations of international humanitarian law in different parts of the world, he underscored that ongoing military occupation impacts the humanitarian, social and political life of the Palestinian people. In this regard, he also highlighted the \"war machine\" against unarmed civilians and continued blockade of the Gaza strip.\n\nABUZIED SHAMSELDIN AHMED MOHAMED ( Sudan ), emphasizing the need for increased funding to save lives, rehabilitate infrastructure and enable resilience, called for enhanced partnerships with regional and international organizations, donors, States and local communities. Increased coordination with local communities, he added, must offer the appropriate level of services, while balancing priorities in a manner addressing the humanitarian needs of all. Underscoring the importance of humanitarian work in peacebuilding, he said experience has demonstrated that humanitarian aid must expand to include projects which generate livelihoods, guarantee the stability of families and residents and avoid any displacement or friction. For humanitarian aid to arrive in a timely manner, States must respect humanitarian principles and operations and guarantee the protection and rehabilitation of humanitarian workers. He then spotlighted his Governments response to several crises and disasters in his country, adding that international support for those affected must not be tied to the political situation.\n\nYANN HWANG ( France ), associating himself with the European Union, warned that in 2023 over 339 million people will need humanitarian assistance. Stressing the importance of international humanitarian law and the preservation of humanitarian space, he cautioned that humanitarian workers, including local workers, are increasingly falling victim to attacks. The international community has a moral duty towards those who put their life in danger, he emphasized, adding that the perpetrators and accomplices of attacks against humanitarian workers must be prosecuted and punished. Warning against the consequences of climate change, he drew attention to the situation in Pakistan and the Horn of Africa. Condemning Moscows aggression in Ukraine, he said the Russian Federation is deliberately targeting civilians, using winter as a weapon of war. He highlighted initiatives such as corridors of solidarity, the farm initiative to support countries most affected by the global food crisis as well as the initiative to facilitate access to fertilizers for vulnerable countries, especially African countries. Further, he voiced support for an increased presence of women in management positions in humanitarian organizations.\n\nNATALIIA MUDRENKO ( Ukraine ), aligning herself with the European Union, said that the Russian Federations war on her country uprooted some 14.5 million Ukrainians, or one-third of the population. Since 24 February, Moscow has attacked Ukraine with more than 16,000 missiles, rockets, bombs and drones, 97 per cent of which targeted civilian infrastructure and residential areas. Millions of Ukrainians are now in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, she stressed, as \"winter is here, and this winter will be the hardest to live through\". Thanking all those who have provided help, she urged the international community to continue supplying aid and protection services to her country. She went on to point out that, despite the horrors of war, Ukraine is one of the guarantors of global food security. As of 2 December, over 12.4 million tons of grain and other foodstuffs have been exported via the Black Sea Grain Initiative, and Ukraine has also launched the \"Grain from Ukraine\" initiative, which will send 60 ships to countries including Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Kenya and Yemen to help those in need. Also detailing the consequences of the Russian Federations attack on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, she stressed that, without immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, grave risks to the nuclear safety of Ukraine and beyond will remain.\n\nMOSAMMAT SHAHANARA MONICA ( Bangladesh ), expressing her concern over negative impacts of growing global needs on humanitarian assistance for Rohingyas, urged partners to scale up their efforts for responsibility sharing and pay increased attention to the deteriorating situation in Myanmar. As a highly climate-vulnerable and disaster-prone country, Bangladesh recognizes the expanding need for the collection and sharing of data and evidence on displacement, she said. International emergency response mechanisms should be tailored to national priorities and the situation on the ground; backed by sustainable, flexible and multi-year financing support; and coordinated with national governments and other relevant actors. The international community, she continued, must undertake development activities with a focus on building resilience and reducing dependency. She then emphasized the importance of strengthening gender-responsive policy development for disaster risk reduction and mitigation, stressing the need to ensure accountability and justice for any reported violence against humanitarian personnel and civilian infrastructure.\n\nMAJED S. F. BAMYA, Permanent Observer for the State of Palestine , said there is no effective humanitarian response without a political response, underscoring the importance of delivering international action and promoting peaceful settlement to bring the humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to an end. He underscored that early international engagement for prevention and resolution of emergency situations will always be far less costly than a delayed, partial and insufficient response. Turning to the economic cost of the occupation of Palestine, estimated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) at $58 billion in lost potential gross domestic product (GDP) in the West Bank alone due to Israeli restrictions between 2000 and 2020, he said that price is higher than humanitarian assistance provided to the Palestinian people since 1948. \"Palestine can, virtually overnight, become aid independent, once its political independence is guaranteed\", he added.\n\nPETER DAVIDSON MCGUIRE, observer for the Sovereign Order of Malta , called for the international community to follow through with the funding promises made to at-risk nations. The Sovereign Order of Malta, he noted, is implementing measures to ensure that communities are prepared when disasters strike and has focused particularly on people who are least able to flee from war and conflict. He then spotlighted the Sovereign Order of Maltas support for Pakistan after the epochal level of flooding, the affected areas of the Chernobyl disaster and Palestine. The United Nations, he said, is the last best hope not only in coordinating humanitarian and disaster relief but also in energizing the will and power to break through differences and put the needs of the sick, poor and marginalized at the centre. \"If all of us expand our collective collaboration with the United Nations aid agencies and related bodies, we can be on the right side of history and continue to earn the respect of those who are, tragically, on the wrong side of the economic divide,\" he emphasized.\n\nLIANA GHUKASYAN, Permanent Observer for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), said that over the past decade, 83 per cent of all disasters were caused by climate-related events. She cautioned that 200 million people every year could need international humanitarian aid by 2050 due to a cruel combination of climate-related disasters and their socioeconomic impact. In this context, she urged all Member States to scale up locally led climate adaptation. As humanitarian impacts of climate change keep growing, so too should financing for local action on climate adaptation, ensuring it reaches the worlds most impoverished communities. No country is immune to the climate crisis and all Governments need to invest in climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction. However, some countries and communities are more vulnerable than others: they have greater exposure to extreme climate; higher susceptibility to disasters; and lower capacity to adapt. Thus, she called on Member States and United Nations agencies to prioritise the most vulnerable and commit to accountable funding allocation of climate finance for adaptation.\n\nShe also called on the international community to increase the amount of climate finance for local actors. Currently, only 10 per cent of adaptation funding is granted to the local level, with less than 2 per cent of total climate funding. The top 30 countries that receive the most adaptation funding are not among the top 30 most vulnerable countries. Additionally, multilateral humanitarian finance remains particularly difficult for local organizations and groups to access. International investment still flows mostly to international organizations, rather than local actors who are on the frontline of the fight against climate change, she emphasized. Raising concern over barriers to climate finance, she said a key part of the solution will be ensuring that climate, development, disaster risk reduction and humanitarian funds work together in a common purpose.\n\nLAETITIA MARIE ISABELLE COURTOIS, observer of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), called on all parties to facilitate the work of medical and humanitarian personnel, respect their safety and security, and preserve humanitarian space. Regarding the urbanization of warfare, she pointed to a milestone political declaration \"Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas\" adopted in Dublin last month by over 80 States. The Declaration aims to improve protection of civilians from explosive weapons in populated areas, one of the major causes of civilian harm in today's armed conflicts. This collective achievement has the potential to change the fate of hundreds of thousands of persons, she said, noting that for the first time in an instrument of this kind, States acknowledge the gravity of the problem and commit to taking concrete actions to address it. It sends a powerful signal that belligerents cannot continue fighting in populated areas the way they have until now, she stressed, urging for broader support for the Declaration. She also called on Member States to operationalize Security Council Resolution 2573 on the protection of essential services and comply fully with international humanitarian law.\n\nShe went on to underscore that, in recent years, several cyber operations have affected States' critical civilian infrastructure, such as nuclear plants, electricity grids and water systems, as well as humanitarian organizations. In this respect, the ICRC urges States to consider the risk of adverse humanitarian consequences when making any decision relating to cyber operations during armed conflicts. Further, she called on States to apply existing rules of international humanitarian law in good faith to ensure sufficient protection for civilians, civilian infrastructure and civilian data. States should also take measures to ensure that humanitarian organizations are protected online and offline and that civilians are protected against harmful information such as hate speech.\n\nActions on Draft Resolutions\n\nThe Assembly first adopted without a vote the resolution \"Strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations\" (document A/77/L.30).\n\nNext, it adopted without a vote the resolution \"International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development\" (document A/77/L.32).\n\nThe Assembly then adopted without a vote the resolution \"Assistance to the Palestinian people\" (document A/77/L.34).\n\nIt went on to adopt without a vote the resolution \"Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel\" (document A/77/L.35).\n\nStatements in Explanation of Position after Vote\n\nThe representative of Saudi Arabia , speaking for a group of countries in explanation of position after the vote, said his delegation joined consensus on resolution \"L.30\" because it believes in the importance of the topic. Turning to the topics on reproductive and sexual health and disease and health services, as mentioned in operative paragraphs 62 and 63, he noted that such issues should be considered in line with national legislation, including religious and social values of society.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation , while noting that her country traditionally joins consensus on resolutions concerning humanitarian personnel, said the International Court of Justice is deteriorating. Over its 20 years of existence, there have been scandalous falsifications and an unprecedented use of incorrect, politicized approaches. She therefore disassociated her delegation from the operative and preambular paragraphs of \"L.35\" relating to the Court.\n\nThe representative of Algeria , welcoming adoption of the resolutions, called on the international community to demonstrate further solidarity by providing humanitarian aid to people in vulnerable situations. Turning to the references on sexual and reproductive health care, he stressed that this concept and principle only refers to health care services in line with national legislation as well as cultural and religious values of societies. At the international level, they must be in line with agreed upon principles of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development as well as those adopted by the Assembly. On the global compact for migration, he underscored its legally nonbinding nature. Countries, he reaffirmed, have the sovereign right to adopt legislation as they see fit to manage their migration portfolios.\n\nThe representative of Trkiye , explaining her delegations position on operative paragraph 17 of \"L.32\", said there is no direct, causal link empirically evident between climate change and displacement, adding that assumptions linking the two phenomena hinders focus on the root causes of the latter. Recalling that various General Assembly resolutions concerning internally displaced persons, migration and disaster risk reduction refer to the adverse effects of climate change as \"one of the risk multipliers or push factors in certain instances, among other drivers\", said that this formulation reflects Trkiyes position on this issue.\n\nThe representative of the Philippines , reaffirming her commitment to the protection of humanitarian and United Nations personnel and the full-forced application of the law against persons who attack them, disassociated from all paragraphs mentioning the International Criminal Court, including preambular paragraph 32 and operative paragraph 8. The Philippines, she noted, withdrew from the Rome Statute on 17 March 2019 out of a principled stance against those who politicize human rights and disregard her countrys independent and well-functioning organs and agencies. As the Rome Statute is anchored on the principle of complementarity, the Court is not a substitute for national courts, she emphasized.\n\nThe representative of Hungary , speaking on preambular paragraph 13 of the resolution \"L.32\", recalled that his country did not endorse the Global Compact on Migration and does not participate in its implementation. In this regard, Hungary cannot accept any reference to the Compact in international documents and disassociates itself from preambular paragraph 13 of the resolution.A51\n\nThe observer of the Holy See recommended that all announcements on this process proceed through official communication channels in the future to ensure transparency and inclusivity so that all delegations are promptly informed and able to participate. In welcoming \"L.32\" for its language on identifying and applying lessons learned and best practices as well as its call on preventing famine and addressing food security and malnutrition, she expressed her reservations on two concepts in \"L.30\" and \"L.32\". The Holy See, she noted, does not consider abortion, access to abortion, or access to abortifacients as a dimension of the terms \"sexual and reproductive health\" and \"sexual and reproductive health-care services\". On \"gender\" and its derivatives, the Holy See understands the term to be grounded in biological sexual identity and difference.\n\nThe representative of Syria , speaking in exercise of the right of reply, condemned systematic looting perpetrated by the United States occupying forces. Opposing claims made by the United States delegation, she said her Government is sparing no effort to guarantee protection for humanitarian convoys. Voicing concern over the negative impact of the unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, she stressed that these illegal and unethical measures deepen the suffering of the Syrian people and lead to extreme shortage of medication as well as limited access to food, water, electricity and fuel. \"Only when the United States withdraws its forces from Syria, stops supporting separatist militias, lifts its unilateral coercive measures that contribute to the suffering of Syrians, only then can the United States talk about humanitarian assistance,\" she asserted.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation , speaking in exercise of her right of reply, refuted the open speculation and misinformation of Ukraine and its Western patrons concerning nuclear power plants. Providing an overview of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission to Chernobyl, she said the plant while under her countrys control was in a safe and secure condition where operators were not negatively affected nor stopped from working. Ukraine, on the other hand, created artificial obstacles for personnel and facilitated an emergency situation, she pointed out. Turning to the Zaporizhzhia power plant, she said Ukraines shelling constitutes the main threat to that plants security. The United States and its allies ignored the documents her country circulated in the Security Council and never doubt Ukraine. This is playing a game with the lives of people in that country and the entire European continent,\" she said, underscoring that the Russian Federation did everything necessary to safely carry out the IAEA mission. Western countries encouragement of Ukraines provocative actions on these two nuclear power plants creates the false idea that such actions will remain unpunished and will promote new and even more dangerous actions. These countries share the responsibility for these actions and consequences, she stressed.\n\nThe representative of Belarus underscored that international cooperation on Chernobyl must be continued exclusively in a spirit of partnership and that this issue should not become a platform for politicization, manipulation or aggravating confrontation. The consequences of the Chernobyl accident were a common affliction, and overcoming them is a common goal. For its part, Belarus remains committed to international cooperation in this area based on dialogue and partnership, and she recalled that her country provided around 20 million kilowatts of electricity to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in March and April to avoid a catastrophe in the region. She expressed hope that nuclear security will be an absolute priority for all stakeholders.\n\nCulture of Peace\n\nATA EYEBERDIYEV ( Turkmenistan ), introducing the draft resolution entitled \"International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace, 2023\" (document A/77/L.10), said the document reflects the main principles of the United Nations Charter to settle disputes by peaceful means and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. As the product of comprehensive consultations, the text reaffirms that inclusive dialogue plays an important role in strengthening cooperation and relations between Member States; emphasizes the role of women, youth, children and older persons; declares 2023 the International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace; and calls on the community of nations to resolve conflicts through inclusive dialogue and negotiation in order to ensure the strengthening of peace as a value that promotes sustainable development, security and human rights. Turkmenistans hosting of the international conference \"Dialogue is a Guarantee of Peace\" on 11 December is a timely and necessary step towards sustainable peace, he noted.\n\nAction on Draft Resolution\n\nThe Assembly adopted without a vote the resolution \"International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace, 2023\" (document A/77/L.10).\n\nBy its terms, the Assembly declared 2023 the International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace, underlining that this constitutes a means of mobilizing efforts of the international community to promote peace and trust among nations based on political dialogue, negotiations, mutual understanding and cooperation to build sustainable peace, solidarity and harmony. Calling on the international community to resolve conflicts through inclusive dialogue and negotiations to ensure the strengthening of peace and trust in relations between Member States in promoting sustainable development, peace and security and human rights, it invites Member States, United Nations entities, international and regional organizations and civil society to facilitate observance of the year and disseminate the advantages of peace and trust, including through educational and public awareness-raising activities.\n\nThe representative of the United States , speaking in explanation of position after the vote, said the resolution would have been stronger and more effective if it referred to tangible goals supported by data. She said her country supports the idea of \"friendship to all and malice towards none\", as referenced in preambular paragraph 14. However, the language in this paragraph does not explicitly clarify how the phrase will be used to strengthen international peace. Turning to paragraph 11 of the 1980/67 resolution of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, she pointed out that any decision on international years or dates should be announced a full year ahead of time, meaning that the first possible year to observe this international year will be 2024 and not 2023.\n\nThe representative of the United Kingdom said that, as the international community looks ahead to 2023 as the international year of dialogue as a guarantee of peace, it must recall what the Charter of the United Nations says about the principles of territorial integrity, sovereignty and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Stressing that \"actions must follow words\", she said the resolution cannot be implemented unless and until the Russian Federation stops its illegal war in Ukraine.",

                "cc_text": "Fate of ZNPP continues to be focus of rumour 5 December 2022 5 December 2022\n\nOn the safety of the Zaporizhzhia NPP (ZNPP) \"there is a concrete proposal and important progress has been made\", International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on 2 December in an interview with Italys La Repubblica. He added: \"The two sides now agree on some fundamental principles. The first is that of protection: it means accepting that you do not shoot on the facility and from the facility. The second is the recognition that the IAEA represents the only possible way forward: it was the heart of my meeting with President Putin in St Petersburg on 11 October.\"\n\nThe interviewer cited Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba as saying ZNPPs protection depends on the withdrawal of heavy weapons and Russian soldiers. Grossi replied: \"The withdrawal of armaments from the plant is what, understandably from their point of view, the Ukrainians ask. It would still be part of the general agreement.\" He noted further: \"Russia is not against an agreement and the principle of plant protection.\"\n\nAsked about the possibility of Russia abandoning the plant, he replied: \"Our aim is to avoid a nuclear accident, not to provoke a militarily favourable situation for one or the other.\" Grossi said he was committed to achieving a solution soon \"I hope by the end of the year. I know that President Putin is following the situation and I am not excluding a new meeting with him shortly, as well as with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\"\n\nHe confirmed that ZNPP \"has electricity that guarantees the management of cooling and emergency systems\", adding: \"But some nodes of the electricity grid that feed it are attacked periodically, with strokes of surgical precision.\" Asked who was responsible for the shelling he said: \"It is not my job to attribute responsibility. For me the important thing is to avoid a nuclear accident and reach an agreement, not to be a judge.\"\n\nAlthough Gross said nothing really new in this interview, it was reported widely in the Russian media, and in many cases misinterpreted as predicting a possible Russian withdrawal from the plant in the event of an IAEA sponsored agreement. This was exacerbated by a report on 3 December by Meduza a Latvian-based Russian press service which purports to be independent, but is generally recognised as having close links with Ukraine. Meduza report repeated earlier Ukrainian reports that Russia was planning to leave the plant, despite categorical denials from high-ranking Russian officials that this was not the case.\n\nMeduza said the Ukrainian General Staff had announced that some Russian military units were leaving the Zaporizhzhia region and were also preparing to evacuate members of local Russian-appointed occupying administrations. \"In conversation with sources close to the Kremlin and the Russian government, Meduza learned that Russia isnt exactly planning a complete withdrawal from the region. Sources speculate, however, that Moscow might be ready to leave the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,\" it said. \"The Kremlin now appears to be planning to transfer control over the NPP either to Kyiv or to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nIt continued: \"Meduzas sources close to both the Kremlin and the Russian government suggest that, to Moscow, the NPP is a bargaining chip, which it hopes to exchange for guarantees of unhampered oil and gas transit across Ukraine. According to two insiders who spoke with Meduza, both the Kremlin and the cabinet are \"ready to make a deal.\"\n\nKremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov rejected any possibility of bargaining over the NPP, and other analysts pointed out that oil and gas transit across Ukraine was not an issue for Russia. In a long discussion in BFM.ru on 5 December, internationally recognised Russian commentator George Bovt, referring to Grossis latest interview, noted: \"If you read Ukrainian sources, most of them predict the imminent withdrawal of Russian troops from the Zaporizhia NPP. Apparently, the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi is also leaning towards this most desirable version of the agreement, hoping to conclude it before the New Year In this case, the agency will advocate the creation of a certain demilitarised zone around the nuclear power plant, which, in the eyes of the IAEA, would be only a temporary solution, because the IAEA still considers Zaporizhia NPP to belong to Ukraine.\" Citing Peskovs denials, he added that this is not a \"likely\" scenario, because Russian troop withdrawal from the plant would immediately lead to its takeover by Ukraine.\n\nBovt notes \"a number of indirect signs also indicate that Moscow is not yet considering the option of completely abandoning the plant as part of the agreement under the auspices of the IAEA\". He points to the recent appointment by Russias Rosenergoatom of a new ZNPP director former chief engineer of the station Yuri Chernichuk and the transfer of the plant to the specially created Federal State Unitary Enterprise Zaporizhia NPP by presidential decree. He also noted that employees who had not signed new contracts with Rosenergoatom are no longer allowed to work at the plant.\n\nThis was confirmed by ZNPPs Telegram channel on 3 December, which said: Only Rosatom employees now work at ZNPP. Ukrainian employees who refused to sign contracts with Rosatom are not allowed to work.\" This came two days after Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom \"dismissed\" Chernichuk for \"collaborative and treasonous activities\" and appointed instead Dmytro Verbytskyi as acting director general of the plant, and Igor Murashov as chief engineer, who IAEA acknowledged \"are not on the site\". Energoatom head Petro Kotin said Chernichuk had \"betrayed Ukraine\" and urged pro Ukrainian staff at ZNPP \"to hold on. He warned those who signed contracts with Rosenergoatom that \"the transition to Russian structures will make you direct assistants of the aggressor, and therefore enemies of your own compatriots\".\n\nBovt also said that, while the NPP is still connected to the Ukrainian power grid, \"this is done in order to feed the cooling system of the plant, all the reactors of which are stopped\". He added: \"At the same time, a power transmission line is being built at an accelerated pace, which will connect the nuclear power plant with the Crimea, after which it is planned to be completely disconnected from the Ukrainian energy system.\"\n\nBovt suggests a \"more likely\" future scenario \"in which Russian troops will withdraw only heavy weapons from the station, although the Russian side insists that they are not there now\". After that, \"a local ceasefire will be established and the IAEA monitoring mission will be strengthened\". He adds: \"If the agreement is implemented in this form, it will remove, at least temporarily, the threat of a nuclear catastrophe due to artillery attacks.\"\n\nHowever, he points out that this will still only be a relatively short-term solution. The reactors will continue to be shut down, and ZNPP will not supply energy to Ukraine. \"Kiev, of course, would like to return it to operation at least partially, but this directly contradicts the current tactics of the Russian army aimed at destroying the energy infrastructure of Ukraine.\"\n\nIn its latest update on ZNPP, IAEA said the site continues to receive off-site power through a single 750 kilovolt (kV) external power line, with one 330kV back up line from the nearby thermal power plant switchyard available. IAEA confirmed that Russia is working to activate additional power lines. \"ZNPP site management has informed the IAEA team that they had received information from Rosatom that a further 330kV power line to the thermal power plant switchyard is being repaired and should be ready soon as an additional back-up power line in case of loss of the 750kV and 330 kV power lines that are routed from Ukraine controlled territory. It was also reported by site management that a further two power 330kV power lines may also be restored, but no deadline was given. There is no information regarding any plans to restore any of the lost 750kV power lines.\"\n\nIAEA also said up to 70 mobile diesel boilers are being gradually deployed in operators city of Enerhodar to provide for heating of communal buildings, houses and flats. \"Currently, these boilers operate at a local school, kindergarten and the hospital. Up to seven mobile diesel boilers are being deployed on the ZNPP site to heat buildings at the site.\" Four of the reactor units remain in cold shutdown, while the two other units are in hot shutdown enabling them to provide steam to the plant and heat to Enerhodar.\"\n\nRussian commentator Yuri Podolyaka, citing a former employee of the Ukrainian Energoatom, pointed out on 4 December that Rosatom will not restart ZNPP units 1-4 until the end of the war because they contain American Westinghouse fuel which would first need to be unloaded as Russia does not have the expertise to use such fuel.",

Soviet propaganda promised easier jobs and cleaner air.\n\n\"We didn't have a reason to distrust the government. They showed us how good things could be,\" she says.\n\nOr so she thought at the time. It didn't take long for Arkadiyivna to turn skeptical.\n\nShe heard from friends and relatives who worked at the Chernobyl plant that authorities would cut corners and pump up power production for the USSR to export to other Eastern bloc countries.\n\nEurope Russian strikes stoke Ukrainian reminders of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster Russian strikes stoke Ukrainian reminders of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster Listen 4:52 4:52\n\n\"The Russians always wanted more faster, more!\" she recalls. \"It was greed.\"\n\nOn April 26, 1986, Arkadiyivna's worst fears about the reactor's safety came to fruition. One of the reactors blew up, releasing a cloud of radiation over Ukraine and across Europe.\n\nThe Chernobyl disaster remains the worst civilian nuclear incident in history.\n\nFor months, the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned of another potential nuclear disaster brewing in southern Ukraine, at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which Russia has occupied since March. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for shelling that has repeatedly hit structures around the site, even as IAEA personnel are stationed there.\n\n\"I never thought I would see another nuclear disaster [in Ukraine] in my lifetime,\" said Arkadiyivna, \"not even during Armageddon.\"\n\ntoggle caption Dmytro Smolyenko/Future Publishing via Getty Images\n\nHow Russia's nuclear energy helped lead to an independent Ukraine\n\nThe Soviet Union put nuclear science at the center of its Cold War strategy both economic and military.\n\n\"Moscow developed nuclear energy above all to control everything to keep it close and protected from possible conflict,\" says Oleksandr Sukhodolia, a Ukrainian energy policy expert.\n\nLike many aspects of Soviet life, the nuclear industry was defined by ethnic segregation.\n\n\"Ukraine was looked at like a kind of outback. ... As far as nuclear power was concerned, Ukrainians were not trusted to run it themselves,\" says David Marples, a historian at Canada's University of Alberta and author of multiple books about the Chernobyl disaster.\n\nAfter the disaster, Soviet Ukrainian bureaucrats raised difficult questions about why they weren't involved in oversight.\n\nYuriy Samoilenko was the chief environmental inspector at Kyiv's city hall at the time of the Chernobyl meltdown. He says he knew there were some risks associated with nuclear energy, but felt misled by the government in Moscow about the scope of the blasts. After all, the power plant is just 60 miles north of Ukraine's biggest population center.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Julian Hayda/NPR Julian Hayda/NPR\n\n\"Why did they say it was safe to go outdoors? Why did they build it so close to Kyiv?\" Samoilenko says. \"Why was it all such a secret?\"\n\nHe linked up with Ukraine's nascent independence movement to find some answers.\n\n\"Before Chernobyl, I didn't understand why we needed to be independent. But I did understand that we're no less deserving of dignity than Russians,\" Samoilenko says.\n\nSoon other environmental scientists joined with the dissidents, and established an organization called Green World. The Soviet government tolerated youth environmental movements, but behind closed doors, the group pushed for Ukrainian independence.\n\n\"The only way to protect the environment is through democratic action because everybody has to be involved in protecting the things that affect everybody,\" says Samoilenko.\n\nBy 1991, they had their wish. Ukraine declared independence and the Soviet Union fell apart.\n\n\"All anybody needed to do to vote for independence was say one word: 'Chernobyl,'\" Samoilenko says.\n\nUkrainians were finally in charge of their own nuclear industry, responsible for 12 large nuclear reactors, with several more planned.\n\nThe Chernobyl cleanup took a substantial chunk of newly independent Ukraine's national budget. Meanwhile, dependence on nuclear energy crept up to 55% of the country's production, according to the IAEA. That rate of production is second only to France.\n\n\"Nuclear power has never really gone away, it's even gone up despite Chernobyl,\" says Marples, the historian in Alberta.\n\nNuclear fears and the Russian invasion\n\nSophia Arkadiyivna is now retired as mayor of her hometown of Kupovate. Ukraine's government erased the village from the map in 1999. That's because it's in the 60-mile-wide \"exclusion zone,\" which was deemed too dangerous for the public after the Chernobyl disaster.\n\nBut after she retired from her other job as a school teacher, she returned, despite the environmental risks. The government turns a blind eye to pensioners like her who opted to return to their abandoned houses. She spends most days now alone, tending to her garden, her main source of sustenance.\n\ntoggle caption Julian Hayda/NPR\n\n\"I'm just happy to be home. I'm happy with every flower, and every leaf, and every animal,\" she says.\n\nShe speaks Ukrainian, with a few Belarusian words peppered in. This village is closer to the border with Belarus just 10 miles to the east than to the former Chernobyl plant. She says she used to believe there wasn't much difference between Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians.\n\n\"Us old folks raised our kids to believe in God: Don't steal, don't kill, don't bother anyone, live virtuously, have a soul, help people,\" she says while angrily chopping vegetables to pickle for the winter.\n\n\"But the Russians beat us, raped us. And today they don't want there to be a free Ukraine.\"\n\ntoggle caption Julian Hayda/NPR\n\nHundreds of other retirees like her lived through the Russian occupation of the exclusion zone in March, as did thousands of Ukrainian officials and workers who continue to maintain the vital power infrastructure that passes through the zone.\n\nOleksandr Havrylenko, the safety chief in the exclusion zone, says the Russians stole radios, tires, batteries or alternators from his entire fleet of vehicles. Many had smashed windows or bullet holes in the doors.\n\n\"I give it a 50-50 chance they'll be back,\" Havrylenko says of the Russian forces.\n\nInstead of working on necessary tasks around the zone, Havrylenko and his team are still cleaning up after the Russian occupation. Having survived the month-long occupation, though, they can hardly imagine the stress that people working at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are under.\n\nHistory How Ukraine ended up with one of the world's largest nuclear power plants How Ukraine ended up with one of the world's largest nuclear power plants Listen 7:08 7:08\n\n\"I'm very, very scared,\" says Serhiy Biruk, a top official with the Ukrainian agency that manages the exclusion zone. He's been involved in the Chernobyl cleanup for 37 years.\n\nAfter Russia forcibly annexed the territory in September, Ukraine's power utility says occupation officials forced Ukrainian nuclear workers to sign new contracts acknowledging Russia's control over the power plant.\n\n\"I don't think the Russians know what the real danger is,\" Biruk says.\n\nBut a potential meltdown is only half the dilemma, according to Anna Ackermann, co-founder of a Ukrainian environmental group called Ecoaction.\n\n\"Ukraine's energy system was meant to function with Russia and Belarus,\" she says. While Ukraine did separate its grid from those countries after 2014, Anna Ackermann says that nuclear energy is centralized by its very nature.\n\nWith the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant now disconnected from the Ukrainian grid, Ukraine loses a substantial proportion of its power generation. That's been exacerbated by Russia's attacks on energy delivery infrastructure across the country over the past couple of months.\n\nAckermann says people want their energy production to be even more local. They're looking to the lifestyles of people like Arkadiyivna, relying on off-grid utilities like batteries and solar panels to survive.\n\n\"We're entering a new area where Ukrainians want autonomy,\" says Ackermann. Autonomy, like energy sources and homesteads they know how to sustain.\n\n\"It's a striking difference with nuclear power plants,\" Ackermann says.",

Can diplomacy at this stage help end the war? Would a ceasefire right now be welcome? Could a change in Russias government bring peace? Why did it happen? After its massive assault on Ukraine, Moscow has stumbled in the face of unexpectedly successful resistance, but it fights on. It has claimed to annex new Ukrainian territories, drafted hundreds of thousands, rhetorically brandished nuclear weapons and attacked energy infrastructure. Still, enabled by Western support, Kyiv has the upper hand. Why does it matter? Western powers see Russias efforts to conquer territory and achieve other goals through aggression and nuclear menacing as threatening their interests as well as Ukraines. They believe the dangers of accepting Russian aggression outweigh the hazards of continued conflict including the low but non-negligible risk of nuclear use. What should be done? The West should continue backing Ukraine while keeping NATO outside the conflict. Pushing for talks or a ceasefire before the parties are ready to compromise would be fruitless. Ultimately, Russia and the West should negotiate new security arrangements, but at present diplomacy will be most helpful in managing the wars repercussions.\n\nI. Overview\n\nIn late February, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, transforming a simmering eight-year conflict into a hot war that has forced millions of Ukrainians from their homes and upended Europes security order. Confounding expectations, and reinforced by military and economic support from Western powers, Ukraines resistance has forced the Kremlin to revisit its goals. As Russian forces struggle, Moscow has proclaimed annexation of new territories; mobilised hundreds of thousands more troops; launched massive attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure; and reminded the world of its nuclear weapons capacity. Thus far, however, little suggests it can turn the tide. Western policymakers wrestle with tough questions about the costs and risks of supporting Ukraine. But the fundamentals remain unchanged: for all the horrors of continued war, Russian subjugation of Ukraine would be more perilous for global peace and security. NATO capitals should maintain support for Kyiv, avoid direct conflict with Moscow and convey to the Kremlin the benefits a settlement acceptable to Ukraine would bring. Nine months after Russias 24 February assault, near-term prospects for peace are gloomy. Both Ukraine and Russia insist that peace will come only if the other party concedes. Kyiv, understandably, wants Russian forces to leave all of Ukraine, including Crimea and territory held by Moscows proxies in the eastern Donbas region since 2014 and 2015. It also wants the Kremlin to drop its unilateral claim to having annexed Ukrainian land. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated that he finds the Kremlin an impossible counterpart and signed a decree ruling out negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, although he has since stated that Kyiv is open to negotiations on Ukraines terms. Moscows position has become harder to read of late, though realistically it holds out little hope for a settlement any time soon. Russian officials say they are willing to negotiate. But they reject Ukraines terms, and offer neither concessions nor explicit proposals, as they fire barrages of missiles at Ukrainian power plants. Ukrainians across the country are facing chronic electricity and water outages as a result. Militarily, Kyiv has the upper hand, but not yet a guaranteed victory, much less a rapid one. It has made territorial gains in the east, during a September counteroffensive, and in the south, including the November liberation of Kherson, the regional capital held by Russian troops since early March. It has also flexed its muscles with long-range attacks on Crimea and Russia proper including early December strikes on the Engels and Dyagilevo air bases, hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border that revealed gaps in Russian reconnaissance and air defences. But Kyivs capacity to wage war hinges upon a steady supply of ammunition and weaponry from the West, whose support remains steadfast, though some in Western capitals do perhaps have an eye on costs and dwindling stocks. Ukraine still struggles at times to ensure that all forces are adequately equipped, with territorial defence and national guard units most often reporting shortages, including of winter gear. At the same time, little suggests Russia can prevail. The Kremlin reacted to Ukraines rebound by mobilising some 300,000 men into the army, most with seemingly scant preparation. Comparable numbers, at least, have fled the country for fear of being conscripted. Moscow has also launched a blitz of Ukraines energy infrastructure, aimed at weakening its morale as winter deepens. In early December, President Putin appeared to recognise that Russia was in for a long struggle.\n\nMost troubling are Moscows consistent reminders to Kyiv and the West of the risks of escalation.\n\nMany of Russias other moves seem geared to unsettle. It deployed several thousand soldiers and substantial gear to Belarus, whence Russia launched offensives into Ukraine in February. Moscow could perhaps attack again from there, but its combat-ready troop strength (about 30,000, when added to that of Belarus) is matched by Ukraines deployments on the other side. Most troubling are Moscows consistent reminders to Kyiv and the West of the risks of escalation, invoking its own nuclear capabilities, accusing Ukraine of planning to use a \"dirty bomb\" and raising worries about a false flag operation. In late October, President Putin appeared to walk some of those threats back, though in early December, he warned the risk of nuclear war was rising, while suggesting that Russia was all too cognisant of the danger. The upshot is that the battlefield remains bitterly contested. The Kremlin appears to be banking on its partial mobilisation to contain further Ukrainian offensives as winter cold, soggy weather and mud complicate operations for both sides. Having lost Kherson, Moscow may expect Ukraine to try cutting off the land bridge of captured Ukrainian territory that connects Russian-held areas of Donbas and Russia proper to the annexed peninsula of Crimea. By moving its most capable forces east of the Dnipro river, it looks to be digging in though some of those units have reportedly gone to Donetsk to fortify Russias forces there.If, as fighting continues, Russias troops have trouble holding the line, Moscow could decide to escalate further, with another draft, even wider attacks on civilian infrastructure or, possibly, at a last gasp though the risk remains low a nuclear strike. Alternatively, it could change its approach to negotiations. Against this backdrop, this briefing addresses four questions at the centre of policy debates in Western capitals. It focuses on the risk of nuclear escalation; the role diplomacy can play at this stage of the conflict; the possible utility of a ceasefire pending broader peace talks; and prospects that a change of government in Moscow might ease the path to peace. The answers, while hardly comforting, should shape Western policy: The risk of nuclear war, while still low, is real enough and must be carefully managed. Still, it is not a persuasive argument for allowing Russia to achieve its objectives through aggression and nuclear menacing. As things stand, the precedent created by making major concessions to Russia would be more dangerous than continuing war. The risk of nuclear confrontation would, however, spike dramatically if NATO were to enter the conflict directly. Both sides need to take care to avoid this outcome.\n\nCalls for diplomacy to end the war need to be tethered to reality. The West, and Washington in particular, should keep the door open to talks. They should continue to make sure that Kyiv does not set impossible preconditions; avoid regime change rhetoric that would deter Kremlin engagement; and signal that a reasonable peace will lead to sanctions relief. Both Kyiv and the West should continue to look for areas where cooperation can blunt the wars effects for example, prisoner exchanges, efforts to sustain and extend the deal that provides safe passage for Ukrainian grain across the Black Sea, and arrangements to manage nuclear safety risks at Ukraines Zaporizhzhia power plant. But calling for peace talks when both parties see more to gain on the battlefield, and neither is ready to compromise, is almost certain to be fruitless.\n\nFor similar reasons, a ceasefire is not on the cards right now. With both parties still believing they can fight their way to a better position, each would demand ceasefire terms the other sees as untenable.\n\nThe likelihood that a new guard comes to power in Russia and brings the conflict to an end is low. The Russian state is too powerful, the opposition too weak and avenues for pressure on the Kremlin too scant for this prospect to be anything on which to base planning. Certainly, trying to force change from the outside would be counterproductive and dangerous. For as long as these fundamentals hold, Western governments should keep providing Ukraine with what it needs to repel Russias invasion. The war is exacting a terrible toll on Ukraine and wreaking havoc on the global economy and, to some degree, world affairs. But NATO powers have judged that to support the grinding fighting in Ukraine, and even bear a small risk of nuclear escalation, is a better choice for them and for the world than clearing the way for Russia to prevail through a brutal military campaign and nuclear menacing. Their calculation is that these costs and risks are the necessary price of preserving Ukraines sovereignty as well as international peace and security. That calculation is a tough one to make: to some degree, it unsettles other parts of the world. It certainly requires continuous revisiting. At some point, the logic may change, pursuant to events on Ukraines battlefields and in Russia itself. For now, though, it is the right approach.\n\nII. How Likely is Nuclear War?\n\nFor all the suffering the Ukraine war has brought, the most terrifying prospect, at least for audiences far from the front, is that Russia uses nuclear weapons, triggering a confrontation with NATO. At the extremes of discourse about this possibility in the West are two arguments: one that Western backing for Ukraine has set the world on an escalatory spiral that will all too likely end in nuclear war; the other that the West should offer greater support, because Russia is bluffing, has no intention of going nuclear and will back down in the face of Western resolve. While the Kremlins calculations are opaque, making it impossible to know for sure, the best assessment almost certainly lies between these extremes. Nuclear war remains unlikely because both NATO states and Russia fear it. But it is not out of the question that, if all else fails, the Kremlin might gamble on a nuclear strike. The best course is thus neither to end Western backing in essence, caving in to nuclear blackmail nor to dramatically increase it. Western capitals should, in other words, prudently manage the escalatory risk inherent in their support for Ukraine.\n\nA. Playing the Nuclear Card\n\nThe primary reason that the nuclear threat has been so central to media and analytic coverage of the war is that the Kremlin has made it so. Russia ushered in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine with a reminder to Kyiv and the West of its nuclear arsenal and the possibility that it might use a weapon. On the day of the invasion, Putin warned Western states of \"consequences such as you have never seen\" if they were to \"stand in our way\". Moscows nuclear signalling grew even more unnerving in September. Putin wove comments about nuclear weapons, and Russias willingness to defend its \"territorial integrity\" with \"all the systems available to us\" through his announcements of mobilisation and plans to annex some or all of four Ukrainian regions partially occupied by Russian forces. The seeming intimation was that Moscow was threatening to use nuclear weapons in response to Ukraines efforts to liberate its own territory, now claimed by Russia. Shortly thereafter, in October, top Russian officials introduced a new angle to the narrative of nuclear peril by sharing what seemed like an entirely concocted set of concerns about Ukraine. They relayed to the UN Security Council and the defence ministers of the U.S., Trkiye, the UK, India, China and France that Moscow believed Ukraine planned to use a \"dirty bomb\" on its own territory. Russias interlocutors dismissed these claims prima facie, as there is no evidence of Ukraine having the capacity, much less the will, to do anything of the sort. But Moscows allegations did raise fears that it might be laying the groundwork for nuclear use against Ukraine, in retaliation for a false flag action.\n\nRussia would resort to nuclear use only in accordance with its military doctrine \"to protect its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and to ensure the safety of the Russian people\".\n\nBy the end of that same month, Putin seemed to walk back some of Russias threats and posturing. Speaking at the Valdai discussion club, he indicated that his past comments about nuclear use had been intended to unnerve, and said he saw no reason, as yet, for anyone to use nuclear weapons. He also said that Russia would resort to nuclear use only in accordance with its military doctrine \"to protect its sovereignty [and] territorial integrity, and to ensure the safety of the Russian people\". Putins statements went only so far in reassuring, however, in part because they could be taken as a departure from the very nuclear doctrine he cited. The countrys 2010 and 2014 published doctrines state that Russia would use nuclear weapons \"in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies\" or in the event of conventional aggression if \"the very existence of the state is in jeopardy\". Its most recent military doctrine, issued as a joint, \"union government\" doctrine with Belarus, offers no conditions for nuclear use, but states that Russian nuclear weapons \"will remain an important factor for preventing\" both nuclear and conventional conflicts. Other doctrinal documents spell out conditions of use that include threats to Russias nuclear deterrent forces, but also speak of using nuclear threats for deterrence ie, to convince adversaries to back down. Putins Valdai speech deviated from these formulas, although in some cases one could imagine that the Kremlin might view threats to territorial integrity as tantamount to threats to \"the very existence of the state\". On 7 December, President Putin returned to the nuclear theme. In widely publicised remarks to Russias Presidential Human Rights Council, Putin warned that the risk of nuclear war was rising and said he viewed Russias nuclear arsenal as primarily deterrent, even if remaining somewhat evasive on his precise nuclear policy, and also noted that \"Russia has not gone crazy\". In other words, his goal was seemingly to convince the world that Moscow was not the one threatening nuclear war while again reminding his foes about Russias nuclear weapons.\n\nB. Global Reactions\n\nWestern states have responded to Russias comments with their own deterrent rhetoric, although the pitch has varied. After Putins 24 February comments, Frances foreign minister noted that the Russian president \"must also understand that the Atlantic alliance is a nuclear alliance\". Elizabeth Truss, the United Kingdoms prime minister from 6 September to 25 October, said when campaigning for the role that she was willing and \"ready\" to use nuclear weapons if needed, though she did not explicitly invoke the war in Ukraine. (Putin subsequently referred to her remarks explicitly in his as evidence that he was not the one brandishing nuclear weapons). The U.S., meanwhile, says nuclear use by Russia would lead to \"catastrophic\" consequences, the specifics of which, according to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the White House has directly communicated to Moscow. Washington has been publicly circumspect about whether and under what circumstances the U.S. would answer with force placing it in direct conflict with Russia, with all the attendant risks or turn to a range of other measures that might include cyber operations, economic responses and delivery of heavier weaponry to Ukraine. Russias partners in Asia have also urged Moscow to exercise restraint. Perhaps most importantly, China called on international actors to prevent a nuclear crisis on the continent. According to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, \"the international community should jointly oppose the use or threats to use nuclear weapons, advocate that nuclear weapons must not be used and nuclear wars must not be fought, in order to prevent a nuclear crisis in Eurasia\". India stated clearly that nuclear weapons should not be used by any side in the Russo-Ukrainian war. Despite the generally wide variance in views around the table, the G20 took a strong line on this issue in its declaration at Novembers summit in Indonesia: \"The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible\".\n\nC. Assessing the Risk\n\nDespite the disastrous consequences the use of nuclear weapons would incur including for Russia itself Moscow might, if unhindered by formal doctrine, see several rationales for a nuclear strike. Some Russian officials reportedly believe, despite all the Wests warnings, that Ukraine and its Western backers would back away from further escalation in the face of Russian nuclear use. If the leadership follows this logic, Russia might consider using nuclear weapons, especially if it senses that defeat on the battlefield is looming and, with it, the chance of domestic upheaval. Hyperbolic as it may sound, Putins propagandists often suggest that Armageddon is worth risking in service to a global mission of Russian greatness. The Kremlin might also judge, particularly in the face of major military setbacks, that it needs to make good on its threats, for the sake of credibility and absent other options. Moscow might also believe it can convince enough people that it is responding to a radiological threat from Ukraine and thus escape global opprobrium. The risk of Russian nuclear use would become far more acute were NATO to confront Russia directly. Most Western capitals appear to understand this danger all too well, given their caution in avoiding steps that edge too close to escalation, including their rejection of a no-fly zone after Russias all-out invasion and their measured response to reports of a missile strike in Poland on 15 November. If Russia were directly at war with NATO, it could conclude that the states very existence was threatened, which is the central scenario for use of nuclear weapons that its doctrine contemplates. Such a war might not immediately threaten core state functions (eg, an attack on the seat of government in Moscow) or Russias nuclear deterrent and capacity to retaliate. But because Moscow probably expects that in any such war, NATO would seek to limit Russian nuclear capabilities, the Kremlin might see these capabilities to be at risk in a range of situations that are difficult to anticipate. It might then launch pre-emptive nuclear attacks to demonstrate resolve or to use its weapons before a U.S. counterforce strike decimates them.\n\nA nuclear strike would not help Russia attain its goals.\n\nFor now, though, it seems highly unlikely that Moscow would gamble on a nuclear strike. Even leaving aside the international outrage, including in non-Western capitals, that doing so would provoke, there are strong practical reasons to eschew such tactics. Put simply, a nuclear strike would not help Russia attain its goals. Indeed, nuclear use would serve no tactical military purpose. While the fear, destruction and mayhem that even a \"smaller\" weapon (ie, one roughly half the size of the bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki) could wreak would be enormous, no crucial bridge can be destroyed, or road rendered impassable, only by using a nuclear weapon. Conventional explosives can be used to the same effect without the enormous risks to Russia itself that would be associated with nuclear use. Even beyond the likelihood of provoking a Western response, these risks include the possibilities that radiation blows into Russia, harming people there, or drifts into Europe, forcing an even greater escalation than might otherwise be the case. Consistent with this logic, Moscow has stayed strictly conventional over the nine months of war, despite its travails on the battlefield and despite attacks on Russian territory as well as on Ukrainian lands that Russia claims as its own, large swathes of which Ukraine has now liberated. Western officials are reportedly aware that Russian authorities have considered their nuclear options, but also say they have seen no evidence that Moscow has prepared or is preparing to use nuclear weapons. Moreover, militaries generally consider all sorts of options in the midst of war planning, so it is difficult to know whether the reported discussions were significant. Meanwhile, the Kremlins increased tempo of strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure horrific in their own right and conscription of hundreds of thousands of men suggest that it plans to keep its escalation conventional, at least for now. Perhaps the strongest argument that the risk of Russian nuclear use remains low is that Russia appears to be counting on its sabre rattling in part to deter direct conflict with the West. Russian behaviour thus far pairs nuclear menacing with the reality that, even as weapons for Ukraine are delivered from NATO territories, Moscow has not struck any targets outside Ukraine. Despite its rhetoric, Moscow, like its NATO counterparts, has thus far steered clear of actions that could draw alliance members directly into the war and trigger a wider, even global conflagration. Its actions suggest that it, like NATO capitals, hopes to avoid direct NATO-Russia confrontation, seeing the dangers such conflict would bring. It might seem something of a paradox that Moscow, in attempting to keep NATO out of the war, is threatening to do precisely the thing that would run the gravest risk of NATO getting more directly involved. Nonetheless, the Kremlin appears to see deterrent value in such threats.\n\nD. Nuclear Menacing and Its Audiences\n\nDeterrence is likely not the only purpose behind Russias nuclear menacing. As with its large-scale bombing of Ukrainian energy and civilian infrastructure, Moscow also appears to hope that it might frighten Ukrainians into abandoning resistance and the West into stopping support for Kyiv. In that sense, the tactic has played differently to different audiences. For Ukraine, which understandably sees the present conflict as existential, regardless of whether it is fought by conventional or nuclear means, the threats are largely ineffective and have perhaps even lost punch over time. For Kyivs Western backers, they are more salient. Violating the nuclear taboo after 75-plus years would be a seismic shock to global security, even before one considers the immediate humanitarian consequences, the possibility of radioactive fallout in Europe and the risks of catastrophic escalation that it could portend. Western officials, for the first time in decades, have had to seriously grapple with the question of how they would respond to a nuclear strike by Moscow. But even in the West, Moscows threats appear to be backfiring. While the nuclear menacing has likely strengthened the voices of those urging caution about direct intervention in the conflict, it has not bolstered arguments for ratcheting back support and, in some respects, has undermined them. At least among policymakers, Russias use of nuclear threats raises the stakes for backing down. They worry that any apparent weakening of support for Ukraine would smack of giving in to nuclear blackmail, which could embolden Moscow into believing that it can throw its weight around in a similar way beyond Ukraine. Some European officials now argue that, due in large part to the Kremlins nuclear threats, the war is existential not just for Ukraine, but also for their countries, which could be threatened in the future. This logic has its limits. Russia does not necessarily have the same designs on other states that it has on Ukraine. Plus, even if Moscows threats fail in Ukraine, it may still try the tactic again, there or elsewhere. Still, if it succeeds in Ukraine, the odds of more such menacing are surely higher.\n\nWestern governments are right to maintain support for Ukraine, while simultaneously steering clear of long-understood thresholds.\n\nBroadly speaking, then, Western governments are right to maintain support for Ukraine, while simultaneously steering clear of long-understood thresholds such as direct NATO involvement in the conflict and deterring Russia from nuclear use. The White House, although making clear that it has communicated to Russia how it would respond to a nuclear strike, remains tight-lipped about those plans, at least in public. But it may well have conveyed that nuclear use would have precisely the consequences that both sides have sought to avoid, pulling NATO into a confrontation that, even if conventional at first, would run a grave risk of going nuclear. Western leaders should also continue to encourage statements, like the G20 leaders declaration in Indonesia and those of China and India, in which non-Western countries make clear their opposition to nuclear weapons use.\n\nIII. Can Diplomacy End the War, and If So, How?\n\nNotwithstanding the bitterness the war has engendered, diplomacy among Russia, Ukraine and others has continued. In the build-up to the 24 February invasion, Western powers undertook a flurry of diplomatic efforts aimed at convincing Russia to sit down with its neighbours to negotiate a European security order that could better serve everyones interests. They also sought to reassure the Kremlin that they had no intention of admitting Ukraine to the NATO alliance, something that, despite not being on the cards prior to Russias invasion, Moscow had long described as a threat to its security. The efforts failed. Russias demands, which included a return to the pre-enlargement NATO force posture of the 1990s, were maximalist and unrealistic, but if they had been a starting negotiating position, talks could have ensued. Instead, rather than coming to the negotiating table, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Soon after the invasion, Ukraine entered into negotiations with its adversary. At first, Moscow demanded capitulation from Kyiv, which the Ukrainian government rejected. As Russias military was forced to withdraw from Ukraines north and centre, however, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators (peculiarly, especially in light of the growing role of women in Ukraines government and military, seemingly all-male on both sides) began to make progress. In particular, they agreed on specific parameters for Ukraines future neutrality an end state desired by Moscow and that Kyiv, at that point, was prepared to live with. But talks soon stalled. Moscow wanted Ukraine to withdraw forces from the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk which Russia recognised as independent states within their Ukrainian administrative boundaries on 21 February, even before it made additional military inroads into those territories and did not want to discuss the status of Crimea. Ukraine wanted Moscow to return to its positions of 23 February, as well as to postpone bilateral talks on the status of Crimea for fifteen years. The negotiations ground to a halt in late March, when atrocities, including summary executions, rapes and other torture, committed by Russian forces in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, came to light.\n\nTalks have continued ... seeking to address the wars consequences.\n\nOther talks have continued, however not concerning the core of a political settlement but seeking to address the wars consequences. Moscow and Kyiv make regular direct deals to exchange prisoners and remains of the dead. Other parties have helped facilitate some efforts notably, Saudi Arabia was a stopping point for Ukrainian prisoners of war returned from Russia, and it assisted, as did Trkiye, with repatriation of foreign nationals fighting for Ukraine who had been in Russian custody. A 22 July deal, brokered by Trkiye and the UN, to restart Ukrainian grain exports across the Black Sea, which provides a lifeline for Ukrainian farmers and global consumers and has helped facilitate Russian agricultural exports, nearly broke down in October, but quickly got back on track. It has now been extended for another 120 days starting on 18 November. Through its own diligent negotiations with both Moscow and Kyiv, the UNs nuclear watchdog agency has obtained access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to help ascertain the safety of the facility, where Russia holds the Ukrainian staff hostage and has established a military base. This record demonstrates the power of diplomacy to mitigate the damage of war, and even to end it, but also the need to ensure that expectations for what it can accomplish are realistic. Experience to date offers no reason to think that if the right formula, or the right mediator, is found, the conflict might end. To the contrary, as the discussion above shows, a wide variety of mediators have been engaged already. They have been valuable in mitigating the conflicts effects, and they, and many others, stand ready to help when peace talks become possible. But, no matter who the mediator, meaningful peace talks can take place only when Russia, Ukraine or both are prepared to compromise. Thus far, neither is. Kyiv is in no mood to offer concessions because it has continued to improve its battlefield position, in defiance of expectations of how it would fare. On 24 February, most analysts predicted that Russia would win a quick military victory in Ukraine. Some argued that Ukraine would resist, and that Russia would face an ugly fight, but these observers, too, judged Moscows military capability to be decisively superior to Kyivs. In practice, Russia proved to be far less capable than assessed, and Ukraine, backed by Western military and economic aid, has had Russia on the back foot for some time, disrupting first its plan of rapid conquest that would force regime change and then its effort to gain full control of Donbas. Moreover, after eight months of war, Russia is in even worse shape militarily than earlier on, having suffered heavy losses of equipment and personnel, including in its best-trained and most combat-ready units, and is now relying on weapons purchased from Iran. Some estimates hold that as much as half of the force that attacked on 24 February is dead, incapacitated or off the battlefield for other reasons. Ukraines long-range attacks on high value targets in Crimea and deep within Russia proper, including early December strikes on the Engels and Dyagilevo air bases (which host strategic bombers hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border), reveal gaps in Moscows reconnaissance and air defence.\n\nKyiv is confident that it is on a path to liberate ever more of its land.\n\nNow, the Ukrainian army, having taken Kherson city and made inroads in Luhansk region, is also spoiling Russias third war plan to gain and retain control of those territories that Moscow had declared annexed, even though it is only Luhansk that Russia ever had full control of (and that temporarily). Indeed, Kyiv is confident that it is on a path to liberate ever more of its land, especially since Russian troops have left Kherson, the only regional capital that they had been able to capture since February. Although winter weather and better-established Russian defensive positions may slow progress, Ukraine has little reason to expect major reversals. Even if his government wanted to cut a deal, Zelenskyy would struggle to find the political space to do it. He must answer to public opinion that is overwhelmingly opposed to any compromise with the Kremlin. September polling indicated that 70 per cent of Ukrainians wanted to keep fighting until victory, and over 90 per cent define victory as regaining all territory held by Russia, including Crimea. As more territory is liberated, reports of the suffering, including gender-based violence, that civilians are enduring under Russian occupation surely feed Ukrainians desire to regain control of their land. Moreover, although Ukraines elites are united behind the Zelenskyy administration, the countrys dynamic political scene has not disappeared, and opposition leaders would rapidly take action in the face of what they would see as appeasement of Russia. Kyivs leadership would likely not survive in power, and any deal it struck might prove less than durable, if it made fundamental concessions to Russia at this time. Russia, although complaining about Ukrainian unwillingness to negotiate, also is not in the market for compromise. Rather, Moscow appears to want only deals that cement its gains and, ideally, more: that is, to maintain its position in the south and east, if not take full control of all four territories that it claims to have annexed. For now, Moscow appears to calculate that devastating attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and reminders to Western states of the risks of escalation will combine with rising energy costs across Europe to shift dynamics in its favour. It may hope that the slim majority the Republican Party now enjoys in the U.S. House of Representatives, and particularly its faction that opposes aid to Ukraine, will erode political support for U.S. assistance. It no doubt expects erroneously but probably genuinely that if it can convince Ukraines Western backers to rethink their support, then Kyivs own calculus about staying in the war will change. Indeed, many in the Kremlin appear to still believe that Western states are forcing Ukraine to fight, even after months of evidence of Ukrainian agency. As for Kyivs Western backers, they have thus far judged that acceding to Russian coercion, and in particular nuclear menacing, would be fundamentally counterproductive to their own security interests. Of course, Western states are not a monolith, and debates continue, as exemplified by comments in November by U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley suggesting that Ukraine should seek negotiations to solidify its gains. But Milleys remarks were quickly countered by his civilian bosses. The prevailing consensus in Western capitals is that if they press Ukraine to negotiate, Russia will think they are driven by desire to end the war, even at great cost. Moscow might then not only seize the moment to press for recognition of its territorial claims, but also, as discussed above, be emboldened to more adventurism, in Ukraine and elsewhere. By way of background, on 11 November, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia was ready to negotiate with Ukraine without preconditions. On 14 November, Russias Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko clarified that Kyivs demand to withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory was unacceptable to Moscow as a precondition to starting negotiations. On 15 November, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said it was Ukraine that refused to negotiate, not Russia. On 1 December, Lavrov said Russia had never asked for negotiations but was ready to listen to proposals for talks. See \"MFA says ready for dialogue with Kyiv without preconditions\", RBC, 11 November 2022; \"The Russian foreign ministry found unacceptable the condition for the withdrawal of troops to start negotiations\", Radio Liberty, 14 November 2022; \"Ukraine refuses to negotiate, not Russia: What Lavrov said at the G20\", TASS, 15 November 2022; and \"Lavrov says Russia never asked for talks on Ukraine\", Interfax, 1 December 2022.\n\nEven if shifts in domestic politics or economic pressure were to bring about a change of heart in Western capitals ... the violence in Ukraine would not necessarily end.\n\nBesides, a withdrawal of Western support from Ukraine would hardly signal the end of the crisis. Even if shifts in domestic politics or economic pressure were to bring about a change of heart in Western capitals, which right now seems unlikely, the violence in Ukraine would not necessarily end. Nor would the region necessarily experience greater stability. While a Western about-face would greatly damage Ukraines war effort, and it might even change Kyivs cost-benefit calculations concerning negotiations, it would probably not make Ukrainian public opinion more conciliatory especially since, at this point, the Russian missile barrages do not seem to be weakening resolve. (An October survey found that 86 per cent of Ukrainians agree that their country should fight on in the face of bombardment.) There could also be other dangers to reducing support to Ukraine. Even if some Western states back away, others (particularly on Europes eastern flank) would strongly resist doing so, leading to discord within the European Union and the NATO alliance. If Russia subsequently were to act aggressively, in Ukraine or elsewhere, generating a new crisis, the states that had scaled down their assistance would be under tremendous pressure to show greater resolve the second time around likely creating even graver risks of escalation than those present today. Against this backdrop, the Western, and in particular U.S., approach to diplomacy is sensibly focused on risk mitigation and keeping options open. The White House has maintained a diplomatic channel between U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Kremlin counterparts Nikolai Patrushev (President Putins national security adviser) and Yuri Ushakov (his top foreign policy aide) to help both sides manage the risk of escalation. CIA Director William Burns met with the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergey Naryshkin, in Trkiye. At the same time, the U.S. has reportedly pressed Kyiv to stop insisting that the Putin government be removed from power as a precondition to peace talks. In so doing, Washington has signalled its discomfort with a posture that in effect makes peace talks impossible, while avoiding the suggestion that the time is ripe for such talks. So, under what circumstances might meaningful talks be feasible? Perhaps the most promising scenario a low-odds one but not completely implausible would see Russias demands change. If Ukraines battlefield success continues, Russia would have two options. One would be to escalate further, with more attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, additional mobilisations, more threats and (however unlikely) nuclear weapon use. The other would be to seek a ceasefire or peace talks. At least some interlocutors close to the Kremlin recognise that Russias resources are increasingly exhausted; that coercion and threats are not working; and that Russian forces appear unlikely to regain the upper hand on the battlefield. \"There is an understanding in the Kremlin that mobilisation will not enable a decisive victory over Ukraine\", a Russian expert close to the Kremlin told Crisis Group. If these views hold sway and the Kremlin leadership offers compromise of some sort (with details depending on battlefield dynamics), Western pressure on Ukraine to negotiate would rise. Ukraines government would also likely be more amenable, although domestic political dynamics would continue to limit what it could negotiate about. In the meantime, Western governments, while supporting Ukraine, can keep a door open to diplomacy aimed at ending the war, even if the moment now is not opportune. They should do all they can to help the Kremlin feel it can back away from the war without risking that its adversaries will try to foment its domestic collapse. They cannot, of course, guarantee Russias stability but they can try to make eventual deals with Ukraine more palatable, including, as Crisis Group has previously recommended, by dangling the prospect of easing the sanctions that have inflicted the most pain on ordinary Russians and reiterating that any peace deal would also require new security arrangements for the region as a whole, to reassure everyone, including Ukraine and Russia. To this end, recent statements by U.S. President Joe Biden, that he is prepared to speak with Putin if the latter sought to end the war, and French President Emmanuel Macron, that he would keep engaging with the Kremlin to mitigate wars effects, hit the right notes.\n\nIV. Could a Ceasefire Be a Positive Step?\n\nCalls for negotiations aimed at reaching agreement on a ceasefire abound in some corners of social media. But as with a broader deal, both Russia and Ukraine insist that an end to fighting is possible only if and when the other accedes to its demands ie, Ukraine withdraws from the territories Russia claims to have annexed (in Moscows case) or Russia withdraws from Ukraine (in Kyivs). Neither scenario is in the offing right now. At some point, if Russia continues to lose ground, it may be more interested in a ceasefire based on the battle lines then in place, but even that would not necessarily make such a deal a precursor to peace. From Moscows perspective, the point of a ceasefire would almost certainly be to buy time and space to rebuild its military capacity in preparation for new offensives and to pressure Ukraine for concessions in the meantime. While Ukraine would just as surely use the time the same way, it has little interest in quitting while it is ahead and giving Russia time to catch up. Furthermore, unless Russia is greatly weakened, it would likely demand ceasefire terms that include, at the least, recognition of its control of the territory it occupied at that time and limits on Ukrainian military activity and deployments. A Russian military expert told Crisis Group: \"The Kremlin wants to retain at least some of the territories it has annexed, and any ceasefire that guarantees this is now in Russias interest\". Accepting those terms would make no sense to Kyiv unless it, too, is facing real constraints on its fighting capacity. Again, as with a broader deal, Moscow may be counting on Western pressure to shift dynamics. But here as well, Kyiv would resist any such pressure. Western states, too, view the idea of seeking a ceasefire now as tantamount to giving in to Russias nuclear blackmail and setting the stage for more of the same an assessment that seems valid based on Russias behaviour to date. At a later point, it is not unthinkable that a ceasefire could pave the way to a broader deal. For now, though, even if new stalemates in the fighting are possible, there is little reason for either side to want to formalise them. Even were Western capitals inclined to push Kyiv toward a ceasefire and Ukraine less impervious to pressure, it is hard to imagine much upside to any ceasefire that might result under present conditions and easy to see the risks.\n\nV. Could Changing Russias Government Bring Peace?\n\nWhile, in theory, a change in Kremlin leadership might create opportunities for conflict resolution, in practice the war is unlikely to end due to pressure from inside Russia. It would be dangerous to try forcing such a change from the outside. A popular revolution is difficult to fathom. On an autocratic path even before its February offensive in Ukraine (Russia has not had free elections or competitive politics in over two decades), the Kremlin has cracked down even harder on dissent and the flow of information since 24 February, driving many opposition-minded citizens to flee the country. Putin and his inner circle control the security services, the media, elections, the courts and the economy. State-approved propaganda rules the airwaves, with independent voices available only via a reliable virtual private network (VPN), access to which can be difficult. No surprise, then, that opinion polls throughout Russia indicate support for the war and for the government. Although these polls are not reliable in a country where social media posts can draw prison time, they do offer evidence of unwillingness on Russian citizens part to express opinions critical of the Kremlins current direction. More dissent could emerge, though the odds are against it. For example, more Russians could lose their inhibitions as frustration grows with war and economic hardship, but even then, the Russian state is set up to prevent real opposition from finding expression. As of now, dissenters face a choice between leaving the country and prison. There are two exceptions. One is the freer rein given to those who support the war, but want it carried out more forcefully and viciously, and to see the forces better prepared. The second is the small wave of cross-national protests by mainly female relatives of the mobilised, complaining that their male kin are inadequately equipped and prepared. While they have faced roadblocks from officialdom, they have generally not been detained. Indeed, the Kremlin took this situation seriously enough to organise an audience with Putin for a group of wives and mothers. These, however, were a handpicked group of government workers and other loyalists. Those demanding an end to war and peace talks with Ukraine were not invited. Alternatively, it is possible that someone within the system would take over from Putin, perhaps even with his blessing were he, for example, to become ill though nothing suggests any such person emerging any time soon. In this case, peace could plausibly follow, simply because any new leader might need to free up resources otherwise tied up in the war effort in order to consolidate support. Thus far, however, though views of the war within Putins inner circle reportedly vary, its members seem to believe that they are better off supporting the current dispensation. \"They [Putins inner circle] may have different opinions on the war, but in the Russian political system it does not matter they will all do what Putin decides to do and no one will argue with him\", a political adviser of a Kremlin-connected Russian businessman told Crisis Group.\n\nA Western effort to overthrow the government is among the scenarios that Russias political and military leadership fear the most.\n\nNor is it clear exactly how Western states could act to effect a change of government, though all evidence suggests that even trying would carry tremendous danger. As noted above, a Western effort to overthrow the government is among the scenarios that Russias political and military leadership fear the most. Support for any group seeking regime change in Russia would feed the Kremlins sense that it is besieged by the West, increasing nuclear risks. If Russia is to change, it will in all likelihood have to change on its own from within which, again, appears unlikely to happen for now. While Western states and Ukraine may not be able to change Russia, they should stay true to their values and continue to engage with dissidents, championing their rights, and with exiles, offering safe haven to those who flee Putins increasingly dictatorial rule. Indeed, more openness to Russians could, over time, generate more support for better relations with the West or, at least, undermine the Kremlins arguments that the West is hostile to Russians.\n\nVI.

Putin said the two countries had betrayed Russia, as they were now pumping Ukraine with weapons. The then German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said in an interview published in Germanys Zeit magazine on Wednesday that the Minsk agreements had been an attempt to \"give Ukraine time\" to build up its defences. Putin said he was \"disappointed\" by Merkels comments.\n\nUpdated at 10.18 EST\n\n9 Dec 2022 13.43 EST My colleagues Andrew Roth, Pjotr Sauer and Helen Sullivan have the full story on the comments made earlier today by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on a potential settlement to end the war in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin mentioned a potential settlement to end his war in Ukraine on Friday while still claiming that his \"special military operation\" was going to plan. The Russian president said during remarks at a press conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan: The settlement process as a whole, yes, it will probably be difficult and will take some time. But one way or another, all participants in this process will have to agree with the realities that are taking shape on the ground. The remarks came just days after Putin appeared to be girding Russians for a protracted war in Ukraine, saying that his military operation could be a \"long-term process\". Initially, Russian commanders expected the war would last just a matter of weeks before a Russian victory, according to plans captured at the beginning of the war. It is now in its 10th month and Russia has been forced to retreat for several months. Despite all evidence to the contrary, Putin claimed that his military operation was going to plan. \"Everything is stable. There are no questions or problems there,\" he said, adding that information was being given to the public transparently. Putin also discussed the potential for a nuclear war in his remarks on Friday, saying that Russian nuclear doctrine doesnt allow for a preventive strike and that in the case of all-out war, strikes against Russia would be \"inevitable\", adding: However, nothing will remain of the enemy.

Russian state-run news agency Tass quoted him as saying that the prisoner exchange of Viktor Bout for Brittney Griner should not be seen as a step towards improving US-Russia bilateral relations. Peskov was quoted as saying: The talks were exclusively on the topic of the exchange. Its probably wrong to draw any hypothetical conclusions that this may be a step towards overcoming the crisis in bilateral relations. His comments came as Russias ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said 30 more embassy staff would have to leave in the new year because of visa restrictions, according to state-owned news agency Ria. Echoing Peskovs earlier comments, Antonov was quoted as saying that he did not see anything positive about the current state of bilateral ties.\n\n9 Dec 2022 13.25 EST Russian diplomats spent months pushing for the release of a Russian assassin from German custody before finally agreeing to release the US basketball star Brittney Griner in exchange for the arms dealer Viktor Bout, according to US officials. Vadim Krasikov was sentenced to life in prison in Germany after being convicted of murdering the former Chechen fighter Zelimkhan \"Tornike\" Khangoshvili, in a park in Berlin in broad daylight in 2019. The killing sparked outrage in Germany and prompted the government to expel two Russian diplomats at the start of legal proceedings in December 2019, leading to a reciprocal response by Moscow. German authorities have said the killing was committed at the behest of Russias intelligence services. People hold portraits of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a former Chechen fighter who was murdered by Vadim Krasikov, in front of the German embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia. Photograph: Zurab Kurtsikidze/EPA US officials have told the New York Times that Russia wanted Krasikov \"as part of the deal\" in exchange for releasing Griner and Paul Whelan, who remains in Russian detention. The paper writes that officials approached their German counterparts to see if they would consider freeing Krasikov, including exploring a sort of three-way deal that would give the Germans something in return.\n\nUpdated at 14.07 EST\n\n9 Dec 2022 12.56 EST Heres some more detail about the USs new $275m military aid package for Ukraine, announced by the White House earlier. The new package will include weapons and artillery rounds, as well as equipment to help Ukraine boost its air defences, according to a statement by the US defence department.

Moscow is offering Tehran an \"unprecedented level\" of military and technical support in return for it supplying weapons for the war in Ukraine, Woodward told reporters. Since August, Iran had transferred hundreds of drones also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to Russia, which had used them to \"kill civilians and illegally target civilian infrastructure\" in Ukraine, she said. Woodward said: Russia is now attempting to obtain more weapons, including hundreds of ballistic missiles. In return, Russia is offering Iran an unprecedented level of military and technical support. Were concerned that Russia intends to provide Iran with more advanced military components, which will allow Iran to strengthen their weapons capability. Speaking ahead of a meeting of the UNs security council, she also said Britain was \"almost certain that Russia is seeking to source weaponry from North Korea (and) other heavily sanctioned states, as their overstocks palpably dwindle\". The relationship between Moscow and Tehran is transforming into \"a full-fledged defence partnership\" with weapons and military expertise flowing in both directions, senior Biden administration officials told NBC News. The officials said Russia is looking to collaborate with Iran on weapons development, including possibly establishing a joint production line for drones in Russia. They added: This partnership poses a threat not just to Ukraine, but to Irans neighbours in the region.\n\nUpdated at 12.40 EST\n\n9 Dec 2022 12.01 EST US imposes fresh Russia sanctions, announces new $275m military aid package for Ukraine The US has announced fresh sanctions on dozens of people and entities over alleged human rights abuse or corruption across nine countries, including Russia, China and Iran. The latest sanctions list includes Russias Central Election Commission, which Washington accused of helping to oversee and monitor what the US said are \"sham referendums\" held in Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine, as well as 15 of its members. The US treasury department also took action against four people it accused of being directly involved in Russias filtration operations. The US state department designated two Russian nationals over alleged human rights abuse against Ukrainian civilians. Meanwhile, the White House said President Joe Biden had authorised $275m in military aid for Ukraine.\n\nUpdated at 12.38 EST\n\n9 Dec 2022 11.42 EST Canada has imposed fresh sanctions on Russia, Iran and Myanmar over alleged human rights violations, its foreign ministry said. The measures included sanctions against 33 current or former senior Russian officials and six entities involved in alleged \"systematic human rights violations\" against Russian citizens who protested against Russias invasion of Ukraine, it said in a statement. Since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, Canada has imposed sanctions on more than 1,500 individuals and entities from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Canadas foreign minister, Mlanie Joly, said: There is more work to be done, but Canada will never stop standing up for human rights.

All times EST.\n\n11:30 p.m.: The United States was finalizing plans to send its sophisticated Patriot air-defense system to Ukraine, U.S. officials told Reuters, while allies pledged just over $1.05 billion (1 billion euros) to help Ukrainians survive the freezing winter.\n\n10:50 p.m.:\n\n9:20 p.m.: Hundreds of thousands of Russians have fled their country since Moscow announced a \"partial\" mobilization on September 21. Many have traveled to Uzbekistan to seek refuge. The Russians say they are settling into their new lives and are unsure how long they'll be abroad. In the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, the arrival of tens of thousands of Russians has impacted the local economy, with rent prices surging across the city.\n\n8:07 p.m.: FDD defense expert Mark Montgomery tells VOA, \"I think Ukraine wants Patriot missiles because they're having short range ballistic missiles shot at them, and they really are out of the kind of weapon that's needed to defend against that.\" But he adds, \"Patriot is an extremely complex and expensive system to operate. Each round of Patriot is between $3 and $4 million apiece. That is a very expensive system. It would use up a lot of the money being set aside for them I think in a, with a very limited return on investment.\n\n\"I think it would take not the one, or two, or three months that it took to train the NASAMS operators, but it would take six to 12 months to train these operators, Ukrainian operators, and they really have to pull their best air defenders from their existing NASAMS units and the S- 300 units, which were already drained to fill the NASAMS units. So, I think it's expensive, it's really long term and it will pull their quality people off the other systems. So, for me, Patriot is not a great answer. More NASAMS, more S-300s, you know, more cowbell.\"\n\n6:40 p.m.: Russias state-owned multinational energy company Gazprom said it plans to ship 42.4 million cubic meters of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Tuesday, a volume largely in line with recent days, according to Reuters.\n\n4:55 p.m.:\n\n3:40 p.m.: Japan chose the kanji character for war on Monday as the symbol for 2022 after a year marked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the assassination of former leader Shinzo Abe, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThe public votes in the annual event for the written character they think best represents the past year. Olympic-themed choices dominated 2021.\n\nThe mood was darker this year, however, according to the Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation, which organizes the vote.\n\n\"The invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the shooting of former Prime Minister Abe, and the rapid yen depreciation and inflation faced in daily life have caused anxiety for many people,\" the group said in a news release.\n\nJapanese TV stations broadcast the announcement live, with Seihan Mori, master of the ancient Kiyomizu temple in Kyoto, writing the character on a large white panel with an ink-soaked calligraphy brush.\n\n2:30 p.m.: The United States is finalizing plans to send the Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine, a decision that could be announced as soon as this week, three U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nUkraine has asked its Western partners for air defenses, including U.S.-made Patriot systems, to protect it from heavy Russian missile bombardment including against its energy infrastructure.\n\nGround-based air defense systems such as Raytheon Technology Corp's (RTX.N) Patriot are built to intercept incoming missiles.\n\n2:20 p.m.: U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Martin Griffiths shared on Twitter some of his experiences while visiting Ukraines southern city Kherson Tuesday, noting that civilian needs are \"immense.\"\n\nGriffiths met with Kherson mayor Halyna Luhova and governor Yaroslav Yanushevych, who thanked the U.N. and its humanitarian partners for their support, according to U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\n\"In the past month, humanitarian convoys have been bringing water, food, medicines, blankets and other essential items to the people of Kherson,\" Dujarric said. \"We have also sent generators to make sure hospitals and schools can continue to operate despite the damage to the energy infrastructure.\"\n\nGriffiths also visited one of 22 resilience points, which are places for people to warm up, when the energy crisis leaves them with no electricity and no heating at home, the spokesman added.\n\n2:10 p.m.: Located astride two major crossroads and home to a decades-old winery, Bakmut has been all but emptied of its 70,000 residents, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nThe city's buildings and houses are or are steadily being reduced to rubble, as Ukrainian troops defend the city's northern, eastern, and southern approaches against Russian forces creeping across fields and gentle slopes dipping down to the Bakhmutovka River.\n\nMany of the full-frontal assaults are being led by soldiers from Russia's notorious private mercenary company, Wagner Group, according to Ukrainian, Western, as well as Russian officials; some reports point to World War I-style \"human wave\" infantry attacks.\n\nThe question is: Why is Russia expending so much manpower and effort to capture this city at this stage in the war a city whose tactical significance is eclipsed by the sustained ferocity of the assault?\n\n\"Militarily, Bakhmut has no strategic importance,\" Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskiy, the commander of Ukraine's ground forces, said during a TV appearance last week. \"But it has psychological significance,\" he said. Capturing the city \"will be symbolic for the enemy,\" he said. \"Therefore, [Russia] is trying in any way to take control of this city.\"\n\n2:00 p.m.:\n\n1:50 p.m.: Ukrainians leaving the eastern city of Bakhmut this week described almost constant Russian shelling that forced residents to shelter in basements and sleep in the bitter cold, Reuters reported.\n\nBakhmut, with a population of 70,000 people before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February, has become a symbol of the grinding warfare playing out along much of the eastern front, where enemy positions have rarely budged more than a few hundred meters in recent weeks.\n\n1:35 p.m.:\n\n1:20 p.m.: A prominent Russian businessman on Tuesday asked a London court to pause an $850 million fraud lawsuit brought by two Russian banks because of UK sanctions, arguing that any money recovered could be used to \"indirectly fund the war in Ukraine,\" Reuters reported.\n\nBoris Mints and his sons Dmitry, Alexander and Igor are being sued by National Bank Trust, which is 99% owned by the Central Bank of Russia, on behalf of Bank Otkritie, once Russias largest private lender before it collapsed in 2017.\n\nLawyers representing the Mints family who deny the banks fraud allegations say the lawsuit should be indefinitely put on hold because, if the banks win at trial, any damages could not be paid as Bank Otkritie is under British sanctions.\n\nBut the banks say their application is \"opportunistic\", describing it as \"a transparent attempt\" to exploit the fact that Bank Otkritie has been placed under sanctions.\n\nThe application represents one of the first legal tests of Britains sanctions regime in relation to Russia.\n\n1:10 p.m.: Ukraines ministry of defense on Tuesday shared video on Twitter of a concert where the audience, in darkness because of recent Russian attacks on the power grid, used hand-held lights to sing along to a song with lyrics by a well-known Ukrainian poet.\n\n12:55 p.m.: Russian forces have apparently used cluster munitions on civilian areas of Kherson at least three times since they retreated from the city, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported, quoting a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report released on Tuesday.\n\nThe incidents were part of a series of attacks on the city that resulted in at least 15 civilian being killed and 35 wounded.\n\n\"Residents of Kherson survived eight months of Russian occupation, and are finally free from fear of torture, only to be subjected to new indiscriminate attacks, apparently including cluster munitions,\" said HRW's Belkis Wille.\n\nRussia has been attacking Kherson from across the Dnieper River.\n\n12:40 p.m.: The International Atomic Energy Agency said Tuesday that its director and the prime minister of Ukraine had made a new agreement aimed at improving safety at nuclear facilities and at helping prevent a nuclear accident.\n\n12:25 p.m.: According to the Russian government, 1.6 million Russians live in 112,353 buildings that have been officially deemed uninhabitable slums, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nIt is unknown how many more live in buildings that residents say clearly should be condemned. It is a national problem that local officials seem unwilling or unable to address.\n\nAt a virtual meeting with government officials of all levels on November 30, President Vladimir Putin raised the issue. \"We have been constantly talking about this,\" Putin said. \"We must move people out of these slums, as I already told my colleagues.\"\n\nIn fact, Putin has been \"constantly talking\" about the problem. He has urged officials to resolve the problem at least seven times over the past 15 years.\n\n12:15 p.m.:\n\n11:50 a.m.: Nearly ten months into the war in Ukraine, the Biden administration is intensifying diplomatic efforts to ensure that the transatlantic alliance that opposes Russia's invasion survives a bitter European winter, Reuters reports.\n\nThe coalition of countries opposing Russia's invasion - from NATO members to U.S. allies such as Japan and Australia - has proven resilient, defying predictions that rising energy prices in part caused by the war could fracture the grouping. But sustaining that united front has required diplomacy and compromise, say diplomats and U.S. officials, and will likely require more as the European winter tests the public's support for Ukraine.\n\nIn the past weeks, the administration has scrambled to adjust its signature inflation legislation to appease European governments whose support it needs on Ukraine, and secured an agreement from the G7 nations to cap the price of Russian oil.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also briefly moderated his strong opposition to talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a signal to allies restless for a negotiated end to the conflict.\n\nThe Ukraine war is also the backdrop for the U.S.-Africa Summit, a relationship-building exercise that starts on Tuesday and brings together the leaders of 49 African nations, many of whom have expressed frustration with paying the economic price for the war, which the United Nations says has worsened a global food crisis.\n\n11:20 a.m.:\n\n11:00 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will hold talks to discuss the events of 2022 in late December, the Russian business daily Vedomosti reported on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n\nDmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesman, told the newspaper that the date and the agenda of the meeting are already known, but an official announcement will come later.\n\nIn a daily briefing with reporters later on Tuesday, Peskov said Xi and Putin were \"in constant communication.\"\n\nRussia has moved closer to China since sending its armed forces into Ukraine in February as Moscow seeks to boost its political, economic and security relations with non-Western countries.\n\n10:35 a.m.:\n\n10:10 a.m.: Dozens of countries and international organizations threw their weight and more than 1 billion euros (dollars) in aid pledges behind an urgent new push Tuesday to keep Ukraine powered, fed, warm and moving amid the onset of winter, The Associated Press reported.\n\nAn international donor conference in Paris quickly racked up substantial promises of financial and in-kind support, a defiant response to sustained Russian aerial bombardments that have plunged millions of Ukrainian civilians into the deepening cold and dark by targeting critical infrastructure.\n\nUkraines president made an impassioned argument that such aid could pressure Russia into pursuing peace, and conference donors strongly condemned the Kremlins savaging of power stations, water facilities and other essential services in Ukraine.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, the conference host, denounced Moscows bombardments of civilian targets as war crimes. He said the Kremlin is pounding civilian infrastructure because its troops suffered setbacks on the battlefields and their \"military weaknesses have been exposed to all.\"\n\n9:30 a.m.: Britains Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told the House of Commons in a recent briefing that Russias invasion of Ukraine has been a \"disaster.\"\n\n9:05 a.m.: Ukrainian officials gave the all clear on Tuesday after air raid sirens blared across the country following warnings that Russia may carry out a new wave of missile strikes, Reuters reported.\n\nNo new attacks were reported despite the air alerts, officials said.\n\nRussia has launched several waves of missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure since October that have caused power outages across the country.\n\n8:45 a.m.:\n\n8:30 a.m.: More than 200,000 Somalis are suffering catastrophic food shortages and many are dying of hunger, with that number set to rise to over 700,000 next year, according to an analysis by an alliance of U.N. agencies and aid groups, Reuters reported.\n\nA two-year drought has decimated crops and livestock across Horn of Africa nations, while the price of food imports has soared because of the war in Ukraine.\n\n8:15 a.m.:\n\n8:00 a.m.: The British government said in a statement Tuesday that 12 senior commanders of Russian military forces, including units implicated in attacks on Ukrainian cities, have been sanctioned, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nThe list includes Major General Robert Baranov, identified by the Bellingcat investigative media group as the commander of a unit responsible for programming and targeting Russian cruise missiles.\n\nThree Iranians and one Iranian company have also been targeted in the sanctions, which include an asset freeze, travel ban, and transport sanctions.\n\n\"The Iranian regime is increasingly isolated in the face of deafening calls for change from its own people and is striking sordid deals with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin in a desperate attempt to survive,\" Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in the statement.\n\n\"Putin wants to break Ukraines spirit, but he will not succeed. Ukraine will win, and Ukraine will rebuild,\" he added.\n\n7:40 a.m.:\n\n7:25 a.m.: Agence France-Presse reported that Swiss food giant Nestle said Monday it was opening a new production site in war-torn Ukraine and would invest tens of millions in a factory and production network set to employ 1,500 people.\n\n\"Nestle is announcing the opening a new production site in Ukraine,\" the company, which had three facilities in Ukraine before the war broke out, said in a statement.\n\nIt said that \"40 million Swiss francs ($43 million) will be invested in production in Smolyhiv located in Volyn region, in the western part of the country.\"\n\nThe aim was to increase \"the capacity of noodles culinary production in Ukraine,\" the company said, adding that it also wanted to help support growth of the Ukrainian economy, which has been ravaged since Russias full-scale invasion in February.\n\n7:10 a.m..:\n\n7 a.m.: Arms shipments to Ukraine will end as soon as peace talks to end the Russian invasion begin, Italys defense minister told parliament on Tuesday, Reuters reported.\n\n\"I am aware that military aid will have to end sooner or later and will end when we will have the peace talks that we are all hoping for,\" Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said while addressing the upper-house Senate.\n\nEarlier this month, Italys cabinet adopted a decree allowing it to keep supplying Ukraine with weapons for the whole of next year without seeking formal approval from parliament for each new shipment.\n\n6:30 a.m.: Agence France-Presse reported that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told an international aid conference on Tuesday that Ukraine needed emergency aid for its energy sector totaling around 800 million euros.\n\n\"Of course, it is a very high amount, but the cost is less than the cost of a potential blackout,\" Zelenskyy told the gathering in Paris via video link. \"I hope that decisions will be made accordingly.\"\n\nZelenskyy said that Ukraine needed transformers, equipment to repair damaged high-voltage power lines, as well as generators and gas turbines.\n\n\"Because of the destruction of our power plants by terror attacks we will need to use more gas this winter than expected,\" he added.\n\nThis would require the import of two billion cubic meters of gas over the winter as well as major electricity imports from EU neighbors, he added.\n\n6:15 a.m.: The Kremlin says that Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be holding his annual marathon news conference this fall, The Associated Press reported.\n\nObservers have attributed the break in the long-held tradition to the Kremlins uneasiness about a string of battlefield setbacks in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed Monday that Putin wouldnt hold the annual news conference this month for the first time in 10 years.\n\nHe didnt comment on the reason behind it, but many commentators attributed it to the Kremlins uneasiness about facing possibly unpleasant questions regarding what it calls Russias \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. The British Defense Ministry observed that the Kremlin fears that the event could be \"hijacked by unsanctioned discussion\" about the war.\n\n6 a.m.: Ukraines Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said Tuesday that the U.N. nuclear watchdog IAEA agreed to dispatch permanent teams to the countrys nuclear plants, including the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia plant, a hotspot of fighting, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nUkraines atomic sites have been a key concern throughout the nearly 10 months of the conflict, with attacks around several facilities including Chernobyl raising fears of a nuclear incident.\n\n\"The missions are aimed at securing the plants and recording all attempts to externally influence them, in particular shelling by the Russian aggressor,\" Shmygal said in a statement on social media following a meeting in Paris with Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nThe prime minister said the IAEAs teams would deploy to plants at Zaporizhzhia, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, Pivdennoukrainska and Chernobyl without specifying a time frame.\n\nShmygal added that during the meeting with Grossi he had repeated a call for the \"demilitarization\" of the plant in Zaporizhzhia, describing it as a priority for Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe IAEA has already deployed teams to Zaporizhzhia, where Russian troops have seized control of the plant and claimed to have annexed the region into Russia.\n\n\"The plant is still in a very precarious situation,\" Grossi said ahead of the meeting.\n\n\"We have started to explore ways to deepen this protection and above all to reach an agreement which will have to involve the Russian side, obviously, to protect the plant,\" Grossi said ahead of the meeting, referring to the Zaporizhzhia plant.\n\nUkraine last week accused Russian troops of detaining two senior employees at the Zaporizhzhia plant Europes largest nuclear facility after a \"brutal beating.\"\n\nRegular Russian shelling in recent months of Ukraines energy grid has disrupted the supply of power to and from the plants, adding to electricity outages and concerns over their safety.\n\n5:35 a.m.:\n\n5 a.m.:\n\n4:30 a.m.: Belarus, a close ally of Russia, has launched a snap inspection of its troops combat readiness following an order from President Alexander Lukashenko, the defense ministry said on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n\nIt was the latest in a flurry of military actions, including a counter-terrorism exercise last week, that have raised fears Russia may mount an attack on Ukraine from Belarusian territory in coming months.\n\nBelarus has said it will not enter the war in Ukraine, but Lukashenko has in the past ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near the Ukrainian border, citing threats to Belarus from Kyiv and the West.\n\nRussia and Belarus are formally part of a \"union state\" and are closely allied economically and militarily, with Moscow using Belarus as a staging post for its February 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAs part of the exercise announced on Tuesday, troops will have to quickly move to \"designated areas,\" use equipment and set up bridge crossings over the Neman and Berezina rivers in western and eastern Belarus, the defense ministry said.\n\n\"During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel, and to temporarily restrict the movement of citizens (transport) along certain public roads and sections of terrain,\" it said.\n\n4:05 a.m.: French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that there was an agreement on removing heavy weapons from Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and that talks were underway on the modalities around this, Reuters reported.\n\n\"We managed to protect Chornobyl and our goal is to protect Zaporizhzhia.

One option could be to escalate the talks to a meeting of EU country leaders on Thursday, and then try again to have ministers approve the price cap next week.\n\n1:55 a.m.:\n\n1:30 a.m.: Reuters reported that the United States has shipped the first part of its power equipment aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said on Monday, as Washington works to support the countrys energy infrastructure against intensifying attacks from Russia.\n\nThe first tranche was power equipment worth about $13 million, one of the officials said. Another source familiar with the matter said two more planeloads of equipment would leave from the United States this week.\n\n1:05 a.m.: The world must \"rethink nuclear safety,\" Ukrainian energy minister German Galushchenko said ahead of a conference held on Tuesday in Paris to discuss Frances ongoing support for Kyivs fight against Russia.\n\n\"Its a very important issue that all the world should rethink what nuclear safety is now,\" Galushchenko told Agence France-Presse in an interview on Monday. \"Thats a question to all the countries of the world.\"\n\n12:30 a.m.: Agence France-Presse provided a preview of the international conference France hosts Tuesday, designed to raise material and money to repair Ukraines damaged infrastructure as well as underline Paris ongoing support for Kyivs fight against Russia.\n\nThe gathering of politicians, blue-chip companies and aid agencies comes after fresh comments about the war from French President Emmanuel Macron which put him at odds with many in Ukraine.\n\nMacron called for Russia to be offered \"security guarantees\" at the end of the war during an interview on December 3, drawing criticism from some Ukrainian and eastern European politicians.\n\nA call between the French leader and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday cleared the air and saw the men discuss Tuesdays conference.\n\nMacron \"reminded President Zelenskyy that Ukraine can count on Frances support for as long as is required to fully re-establish its sovereignty and national integrity,\" according to the French presidency.\n\nBoth men will address the first part of the conference, called \"Solidarity with the Ukrainian People\" Macron in person and Zelenskyy via video link.\n\nThe event will focus on ways in which Ukraines Western allies can provide immediate support to keep the countrys civil infrastructure functioning amid incessant bombing from Russia.\n\n12:05 a.m.: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged G-7 nations on Monday to provide extra gas and weapons to help Ukraine survive a brutal winter that threatens to bring further suffering to millions in the war-torn country, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nWith snow on the ground and Ukraines energy grid battered by Russian strikes, many are facing freezing temperatures without power or heating.\n\nDuring a video conference with the G-7 club of wealthy nations on Monday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine needs \"about two billion cubic meters\" of additional gas to get through the winter.\n\nHe also urged the G-7 to send more arms to Ukraine, including \"modern tanks\" as well as \"rocket artillery and more long-range missiles.\"\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

                "cc_text": "Russia's war in Ukraine has renewed fears of nuclear disaster in a world that hasn't seriously grappled with the health effects of radiation since the 2011 Fukushima crisis.\n\nDisaster could come in several forms:\n\nA radioactive release from a nuclear reactor\n\nA conventional bomb loaded with radioactive material\n\nAnd the worst-case scenario: a nuclear bomb\n\nExperts say the deliberate use of nuclear weapons represents the worst possible outcome because it could lead to retaliation and escalate into a global nuclear war.\n\nIn the absence of that kind of war, experts say there are medicines that can help protect people from some types of nuclear disaster. And understanding the risks and the kinds of radiation people are exposed to are key to treating potential exposures.\n\nIn the case of a nuclear disaster in the U.S., the federal government maintains stockpiles of treatments distributed around the country so they can be delivered anywhere within 12 hours. These include treatments such as iodine pills and medicine to produce white blood cells, which counteract different kinds of radiation exposures.\n\nWhy is radiation dangerous?\n\nThe term \"radiation\" is commonly used as a shortened description of ionizing radiation, which strips electrons from molecules and can scramble DNA.\n\nRadioactivity occurs naturally from the cosmic rays that bombard the Earth to those released from certain kinds of rocks and can be used for things like x-rays. But too much exposure to radiation typically raises the risk of developing cancerous tumors, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNuclear materials like the fuel for power plants or bombs are typically refined from naturally occurring radioactive ore, with the difference largely being a question of how highly concentrated they are.\n\nWhat are the risks and treatment if nuclear power plant radioactivity is released?\n\nA leak from Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is among the highest risk, experts told USA TODAY, because Russia has deliberately targeted the area. Zaporizhzhia is Europe's largest nuclear power station and has been under Russian control since shortly after the invasion.\n\nThe U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency is trying to establish a safety zone around the plant because while nuclear power plants are built to withstand many natural disasters, few are designed to survive direct military attacks, said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists. An attack on the plant could potentially release intense radiation in a small area and weaker radioactive particles over a wider area.\n\n\"The fact that Russia would want to seize that plant, it's not surprising,\" said Lyman. \"I think it's sort of inevitable. And it's something the industry never wanted to think about.\"\n\nThe Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, which is also in Ukraine, is not considered a serious potential source of radiation leakage, in part because its 1986 meltdown led to its shutdown and removal of its nuclear fuel system. However, the Health Physics Society says there could be small, localized releases of radioactive material if the area is disturbed.\n\nChernobyl disaster:A look at the what happened, 30 years later\n\nWhat happened following the Chernobyl meltdown could be the same as for Zaporizhzhia: A relatively small number of plant operators exposed to intense radiation, and then broader contamination carried in the wind and water absorbed into the land and animals. Nuclear power plants are designed to avoid the kind of explosion created by a nuclear bomb.\n\nAccording to the CDC, exposure to Acute Radiation Syndrome only happens to people exposed to intense radiation, generally in a very short period of time. That could be someone working in a nuclear power plant during a meltdown, or someone near the site of nuclear weapon's detonation.\n\nFor these people, specialized treatments to protect their bone marrow and stomach lining vomiting and nausea are common signs of ARS are available but not widely distributed, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nFor the public, authorities often have stockpiles of potassium iodide pills, especially in areas close to nuclear power plants. The iodide pills help prevent the thyroid gland from absorbing radiation, which could lead to tumors, but do not treat other kinds of radiation exposure, according to the CDC.\n\nAuthorities typically maintain stockpiles of the pills but don't give them out unless there's a confirmed release, and even then, they are typically given to people 40 and younger because they are most at risk for developing thyroid problems later in life.\n\nFor people who are near a reactor accident but not immediately harmed, the CDC recommends they get or stay inside to avoid any potentially radioactive dust or smoke, remove and bag up any potentially contaminated clothing, and then shower to remove any particles on exposed skin and hair.\n\nA nuclear risk 'nightmare'? After seizing Chernobyl, Russian troops exposed themselves to radiation\n\nWhat are the risks and treatment for a dirty bomb?\n\nFederal officials say a \"dirty bomb\" would typically be created by taking conventional explosives and adding in radioactive materials that would be dispersed by the explosion. It wouldn't cause as big of an explosion as a nuclear weapon nor release the same kind of intense radioactivity but would potentially disperse radioactive particles over a large area, potentially causing panic and evacuations.\n\nProtection for exposure to a dirty bomb is similar to that of a reactor incident: Get or stay inside, get rid of potentially contaminated clothing, and then shower.\n\nPotassium iodide pills would likely not be recommended for that kind of radiation exposure, the CDC says, but a treatment based on a drug called Prussian blue could be used.\n\nRadiogardase, the brand name, was approved by the FDA in 2003 to help treat cesium or thallium exposure. Those radioactive substances are often used in medical treatments for cancer, but federal officials say they could also be used in a dirty bomb because they are more widely available. The federal government maintains a stockpile of Prussian blue and other drugs to treat radioactivity exposure.\n\nWhat are the risks and treatment for a nuclear weapon?\n\nA nuclear explosion is the worst combination of all: an intense blast of radioactivity followed by the fallout of radioactive particles that would contaminate the air, water and ground, along with animals and other food sources.\n\nThe same advice follows for people near an explosion but not harmed: get inside, get rid of contaminated clothing, and shower. The U.S. government stockpiles would also come into play.\n\nLyman, the nuclear expert, said the key question is whether those treatments can be effectively distributed following a nuclear attack on the United States.\n\n\"If you had a large nuclear weapon detonated, and you had hundreds of thousands of people affected, you'd need to treat them in a day,\" he said. \"Having the drugs is one thing. Having a plan to actually use them is another. I wouldn't count on those interventions. Prevention is where you have to put most of your effort.\"",

Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nOn a fairly typical night last week, the Russians on the left bank of the river fired 40 shells and rockets into Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-held right bank, falling on its rows of krushchevky, five-storey blocks of flats built for factory workers in the 1960s and named after the Soviet leader of the time.\n\nAfter 10 months of war, the blocks are half empty, so there are fewer people to kill. The only reported casualty on this particular night was a 65-year-old man who was taken to hospital, and whose flat now afforded such a comprehensive view of the power plant.\n\nBy the next morning, the repairs had already begun. An electrician restored power to the rest of the building, and two men were in the remains of the apartment itself, sweeping up and putting chipboard in place of absent walls.\n\nThere were four loud bangs as the Ukrainian army guns on the nearby riverbank opened fire on Russian positions and, a few minutes later, Nikopols air sirens sounded in anticipation of a Russian response, though none was forthcoming that morning.\n\nThe basements of the krushchevky have been turned into shelters with beds and school desks but most of the remaining population are so inured to bombardment, they just carry on with their day.\n\nThe Ukrainians insist they are extremely careful about what they shoot at, even when they receive fire from the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant. On Thursday, the Ukrainian nuclear power company, Energoatom, accused Russia of bringing Grad multiple launch rocket systems near reactor number 6, which is near the area of where spent nuclear fuel is kept. The likely aim, Energoatom alleged, was to shell Nikopol and the nearby town of Marzanets, using their position as cover.\n\nThe walls of the reactors are thick enough to withstand artillery fire, but a direct hit on the spent fuel containers could well lead to the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Since seizing control of the power station in March, the Russians have begun building a concrete shelter over the spent fuel, but Ukrainian officials say it is being done without following the normal international safety protocols.\n\nEarlier in the week, Russias defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine of \"nuclear terrorism\", saying its armed forces had fired 33 large calibre shells at the Zaporizhzhia plant over the previous two weeks. The most recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has four inspectors at the Russian-occupied site, said last Friday there had been no shelling of the plant since 20 November, although artillery fire had landed in the vicinity.\n\nPetro Kotin, Energoatoms president, claims that the bombardments of the area around the nuclear reactors are false flag attacks carried out by Russian occupation forces.\n\n\"They have two special trucks, which we know have mortars inside, which go into the forest and each time they go there, there is shelling around the plant,\" Kotin told the Guardian.\n\nDmytro Orlov, mayor of Energodar, says there are no Ukrainian forces in the areas from which shelling is coming. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nDmytro Orlov, the mayor of Enerhodar, the town next to the nuclear plant that is home to its workers, claimed there was additional evidence that the shelling was coming from the Russian side. \"You can hear the outgoing bang of the shooting and then the two or three seconds later the shell lands, so it is coming from very close and there arent any Ukrainian forces that close,\" Orlov said in an interview on the Ukrainian side of the lines in the city of Zaporizhzhia where he continues his duties in exile.\n\n\"My personal opinion is that this is to scare the local population so the Russians can tell them: \"You see were protecting you and its the Ukrainians who are shelling you.\"\n\nIt was not possible to verify Kotin and Orlovs accounts of the shelling, or the counter-claims from Moscow. Satellite imagery however, has confirmed that the Russian army is storing military equipment inside the plant.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The agency is negotiating the creation of a security no-fire zone around the reactors, but Kyiv is insisting Russia must first withdraw all its weapons and armour from the power station, something Moscow has not so far agreed to.\n\nMeanwhile there is a parallel safety threat from within the plant itself: the steady attrition of its workforce over the 10 months of the conflict. Many key workers have left because of the danger to their families or because they refused to work for the Russians. Of the 11,000-strong workforce before the full-scale invasion, just 4,000 are left. In an attempt to stop the exodus, the Russians have circulated lists of plant staff to all military checkpoints in the region with orders they are not be allowed to leave, but it has been too late to stop a major outflow.\n\n\"In some cases, theres only three people to cover a seven or eight-person shift,\" Orlov said. \"People dont have enough rest. It causes exhaustion.\"\n\nOperating under armed occupation adds to the stress. The workers still at the plant are under constant pressure to sign contracts with Rosatom, the Russian energy company, signifying acceptance of Moscows control.\n\nThe Russian invaders use threats against workers families to put pressure on them to carry on going into the plant, says Oleksii Melnychuk. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\n\"They take the workers aside one at a time, and the first question they ask is about the whereabouts of their families. They put pressure on through their family. One worker was questioned for eight hours,\" Oleksii Melynchuk, a former worker at the nuclear power plant, said. Despite that pressure, he said, only about 10% of the staff at the plant have signed Rosatom contracts.\n\nIn recent days, the Russians have deactivated the electronic passes of some of the workers who have refused to sign, reducing the pool of available reactor operators even further.\n\nMelynchuk said there were just enough staff left to maintain the plant in its current state of suspended animation, with all the reactors shut down, and two of them deliberately kept hot, to provide heating for Enerhodar.\n\nBut keeping reactors in this hot standby mode is a difficult and delicate process, adding to the burden on the operators. The situation could get worse still. The Zaporizhzhia plant is currently connected to the Ukrainian grid, but there have been times the transmission lines have been brought down by shelling, forcing the power station to fall back on diesel generators to keep the cooling system running and prevent the reactor vessel from meltdown.\n\nIf the connection to the grid was severed again, it would add to the pressure on the overstretched workforce and on the generators, which were only designed as a temporary backup. They will need maintenance and no one knows how much diesel fuel the plant has left. Once the diesel generators failed, meltdown would begin in a matter of hours.\n\n\"Those remaining at their posts are doing impossible things to keep the plant safe. They have proved their professionalism to the entire world,\" Melynchuk said. \"Even without the occupation, it would be very hard physically and psychologically to operate the station with the current staffing levels. But if you add the pressure from the occupiers, then it just gets harder.\"",

Kyiv has not directly claimed responsibility for the strikes but has celebrated them.\n\nThe New York Times, citing a senior Ukrainian official, said the drones involved in Mondays attacks were launched from Ukrainian territory, and at least one of the strikes was made with the help of special forces close to the base.\n\nIn response, Russias Defense Ministry claimed to have struck Ukraines military command system on Monday with a massive high-precision strike.\n\n\"If Russia assesses the incidents were deliberate attacks, it will probably consider them as some of the most strategically significant failures of force protection since its invasion of Ukraine,\" the UK Defense Ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nUkraines military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov has also said that Moscows military stocks are coming to an end, though he added that the country has enough high-precision missiles to conduct several more big air strikes on Ukraine before it runs out.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian officials have warned that emergency blackouts will once again take place in several regions on Tuesday following the latest trikes.\n\nAt least four people were killed on Monday as Russian rockets hit several cities, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. \"In many regions, there will have to be emergency blackouts. We will be doing everything to restore stability.\"\n\nUkraines Energy Minister German Galushchenko said power generators and substations in Kyiv, Vinnytsia, and Odesa in the south had suffered the worst damage.\n\nAbout half the region surrounding the Ukrainian capital will remain without electricity for the coming days, according to the Kyiv regional governor.\n\nUkraines air force command claims to have shot down more than 60 of over 70 missiles launched by Russia on Monday.\n\nThe strikes targeted once again Ukraines energy infrastructure, threatening to leave the country in the dark on one of the coldest days of the year so far.\n\n\"Air defenses shot down most of the rockets, and energy workers have already started to restore electricity,\" Zelensky said.\n\nMoscow denies targeting Ukrainian civilians but said their suffering would not end unless Kyiv yielded to Russias demands.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zelensky visited Sloviansk in Ukraines eastern Donbas region on Armed Forces Day to salute his countrys military from the \"bottom of his heart\".\n\n\"We always start by remembering our fallen heroes, all those who gave their lives to Ukraine,\" he said, according to video on social media. Unlike Putin, Zelensky has visited the frontline many times since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nSloviansk is also located 45 kilometers from Bakhmut, where intense fighting has been raging for several weeks.\n\nIn another development, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has accused Kyiv of \"nuclear terrorism,\" saying that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia power plant\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have repeatedly blamed each other for shelling near the plant, which has raised concerns of a possible nuclear catastrophe.\n\nOn Tuesday, Shoigu said that Ukraine had fired 33 large-caliber shells at the plant in the last two weeks. He claimed that most were intercepted by Russian air defenses, but added that \"some still hit objects that affect the safe operation of the nuclear power plant.\"\n\nThe minister said that Russian forces were taking \"all measures\" to ensure the safety of the power plant in the face of Kyivs alleged attacks, which Moscow sees as \"nuclear terrorism.\"\n\nUkraine denies targeting the facility, which has been under the control of Russian forces since the beginning of the invasion.\n\nLocal Ukrainian officials have said that Russia shelled towns overnight near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, leaving more than 9,000 homes without running water.\n\nKyiv has also accused Moscow of using the plant as a de facto weapons depot.\n\nThe United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency is pushing to create a security zone around the plant, but the idea has yet to be implemented.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Tuesday there were \"positive dynamics\" in discussions with the IAEA on the idea, according to the TASS state news agency.\n\nAlso, Russia and Ukraine reported on Tuesday they had exchanged 60 prisoners of war in the latest of a series of such swaps.\n\nRussias defense ministry said the 60 freed Russian soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical care and psychological support.\n\nUkraines presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak also hailed the returning Ukrainians as heroes and said they included dozens who had held out in the city of Mariupol including the besieged Azovstal steelworks until Russia forced its surrender in May.\n\n\"We continue to return the defenders of Mariupol - in todays list of 60 there are 34 of them, including 14 from Azovstal,\" Yermak said.\n\n\"Some are wounded, and will receive all the necessary help in Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nSome of those released had been held on Russian territory and others in Olenivka, a prisoner-of-war camp in the Russian-occupied Donetsk region of Ukraine, Yermak said.\n\nThe two sides have exchanged hundreds of prisoners in a series of swaps over the past several months.\n\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine have released official figures on how many prisoners of war they have taken since the invasion began exactly nine months ago.\n\nUkraines president Zelensky said last week that Russia had freed 1,319 prisoners since March.\n\nLatvia, meanwhile, has revoked the license of Russias most prominent independent television channel, Dozhd (TV Rain).\n\nThe Latvian broadcasting regulator on Monday accused TV Rain of supporting Russias military in Ukraine and of being a threat to national security and public order.\n\nThe decision followed the unscripted comments by a presenter saying they hoped the stations efforts would help provide Russian troops with basic equipment and amenities.\n\nThe journalist has since been fired and TV Rain apologized to its viewers, but the remarks led Latvias State Security Service to launch an investigation.\n\nTV Rain was forced to broadcast from Latvia and other countries abroad in July after being kicked out of Moscow following Russias invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe station was then banned by the Kremlin entirely for spreading so-called \"fake news\" about Russias army or its entities abroad.\n\nBut the station has recently been courting controversy in Latvia too, receiving a 10,000 fine for displaying a map of Russia which included the occupied territory of Crimea, and calling Moscow troops in Ukraine \"our army.\"\n\nAccording to Latvian law, TV channels can lose their license if they commit offenses three times in one year.

The plant in southern Ukraine, Europe's largest, has been occupied since shortly after Russia's February 24 invasion but is still operated by its Ukrainian staff.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian forces were telling Ukrainian workers at the plant that they would not be paid after January 1 if they did not sign contracts with Russia's nuclear energy company, Rosatom.\n\n\"Energoatom continues to guarantee the payment of wages and all compensations provided for in the collective agreement to ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) employees. In addition, from January 1, Energoatom is also increasing from 20% to 50% the bonus for ZNPP personnel who stay loyal to Ukraine.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree in October transferring the Zaporizhzhia plant from Energoatom to subsidiary of Rosatom in what Kyiv said amounted to theft.\n\n5:58pm: French TV regulator urges Eutelsat to stop broadcasting three Russian channels\n\nFrench broadcasting authority Arcom on Wednesday urged satellite company Eutelsat to stop carrying three Russian TV channels.\n\nArcom said it notified Eutelsat it needed to stop broadcasting Rossiya 1, Perviy Kanal and NTV, whose programmes on the war in Ukraine \"include repeated incitement to hatred and violence and numerous shortcomings to honesty of information.\"\n\nFrance's top administrative court last week ordered the regulator to review its initial decision over the distribution of the three channels in a win for Reporters Without Borders.\n\n3:24pm: Red Cross chief sees possibility of 'all-for-all' prisoner swap deal in Ukraine\n\nThe head of the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Wednesday she saw the possibility of a major prisoner of war swap deal in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.\n\n\"On an all-for-all exchange, it has happened in the past, it is a known practice, and it can happen in the Russia-Ukraine international conflict as well,\" Mirjana Spoljaric Egger told reporters.\n\n\"So this possibility is certainly one that can be taken by the parties.\" She declined to give further details.\n\n3:18pm: Ukrainian people receive Sakharov freedom prize\n\nThe people of Ukraine received the European Parliament's annual Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought on Wednesday to honour their fight against Russia's invasion.\n\n\"There is no one more deserving of this prize,\" said European Parliament president Roberta Metsola at an event with representatives of Ukrainian society who received the prize on behalf of the country's people.\n\nThe prize, named after the late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, has been awarded annually since 1988 to individuals and organisations defending human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\n12:53pm: Zelensky urges Europe to back war tribunal for Russian leaders\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Wednesday urged Europe to help set up a tribunal to try Russia's leadership for the \"crime of aggression\", as he accepted the EU's top rights award.\n\n\"I call on all of you, your parties and states to effectively support this work. The tribunal must start working,\" Zelensky told the European Parliament in a speech via video link.\n\n12:33pm: Ukraine considers moves to ensure border security, says president's office\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and top military officials discussed moves to ensure border security at a meeting of the supreme command on Wednesday, the president's office said.\n\nThe office placed particular emphasis on the moves to secure the border in a statement issued after the meeting, without saying which part of the border was focussed on.\n\nThe statement followed a flurry of military activity in neighbouring Belarus, an ally of Moscow.\n\n12:26pm: Release of 64 Ukrainian servicemen, one US citizen secured in prisoner swap, Ukraine says\n\nUkraine said Wednesday that it had secured the release of a US citizen as well as 64 Ukrainian military servicemen in its latest prisoner swap with Russian forces.\n\n\"Sixty-four soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces who fought in Donetsk and Lugansk in particular participated in the defence of the city of Bakhmut are going home,\" the Ukraine presidency's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on social media.\n\n\"It was also possible to free a US citizen who helped our people Suedi Murekezi,\" Yermak said.\n\nRussia's state-run TASS news agency has reported that Murekezi was arrested in the Donetsk region of Ukraine in June and charged with attending anti-Russian protests and inciting \"ethnic hatred\".\n\n12:21pm: Russian forces strike Kherson regional administration building, Ukraine says\n\nRussian forces firing rockets hit the regional administration building in the city of Kherson on Wednesday, the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office said.\n\nUkraine recaptured Kherson from Russian forces on November 11, prompting days of celebrations by residents on the citys central square, where the administration building is located.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the square on November 14 to hail the end of the Russian occupation.\n\nRussian forces have been shelling Kherson from the opposite side of the Dnipro River since leaving the city.\n\n11:38am: Pope calls for people to spend less on Christmas, donate savings to Ukraine\n\nPope Francis on Wednesday called on people to spend less on Christmas presents and celebrations, and donate the money saved to those in war-ravaged Ukraine.\n\n\"It is nice to celebrate Christmas. But let's lower the level of Christmas spending a bit,\" Francis said in his weekly general audience at the Vatican.\n\n\"Let's have a more humble Christmas, with more humble gifts. Let's send what we save to the Ukrainian people, who need it,\" he said.\n\nNearly 10 months into the war, hardship from the fighting has compounded as winter sets in and Russia pounds Ukraine's energy infrastructure.\n\nThe Ukrainians \"are suffering so much. They are hungry, cold. So many people are dying because there are no doctors or nurses\", the pope said.\n\n11:11am: Kremlin says it has not received proposals for 'Christmas ceasefire'\n\nThe Kremlin said on Wednesday it had not received any proposals about a \"Christmas ceasefire\" in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called earlier this week on Russia to start withdrawing its troops from Ukraine by Christmas as the first step towards a peace deal in the conflict, which has been raging for almost 10 months.\n\n11:03am: Kremlin says US Patriot missile defence systems in Ukraine would be legitimate target\n\nThe Kremlin said on Wednesday that US Patriot missile defence systems would be a legitimate target for Russian strikes against Ukraine, should the United States authorise the systems to be delivered to support Kyiv.\n\nWashington is finalising plans to send the Patriot system to Ukraine, a decision that could be announced as soon as this week, three US officials told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nBut what would this technology mean for Ukraine? FRANCE 24 correspondent Gulliver Cragg, reporting from Kyiv, says it's \"something the Ukrainians have been clamouring for for months\". He explains that \"the older, Soviet-made systems that Ukraine has are seriously running out of ammunition\".\n\n02:13\n\n10:32: Russian drone strikes on Kyiv did not damage power sector, says Ukrenergo\n\nRussian drone strikes on Kyiv and the region around the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday did not damage any energy facilities, national power grid operator Ukrenergo said.\n\nRussia has been targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure with big waves of missile and drone strikes since October.\n\n\"Thanks to the brilliant work of the air defence forces, the energy infrastructure facilities were not damaged (on Wednesday) all 13 drones were shot down,\" Ukrenergo said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n9:51am: Villages in Mykolaiv region without electricity\n\nBack from Ukraine, FRANCE 24 chief foreign editor Rob Parsons recounts the difficulties faced by Mykolaiv region inhabitants weathering icy conditions without power.\n\n\"Many of [the villages] havent had electricity for the last nine months,\" says Parsons. Ukrainian electricians are trying to restore infrastructure in \"awful\" conditions while working carefully near mined terrain.\n\n04:38\n\n9:28am: Don't undermine EU with foreign policy vetoes, Scholz warns member states\n\nThe European Union is united in its support for Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the German parliament, adding, with apparent reference to Hungary, that attempts to undermine the bloc's values by blocking foreign policy measures would fail.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks he can undermine the values of the EU, to which every member state has committed itself, by blocking its foreign and security policies, will fail in that attempt,\" he told legislators on Wednesday.\n\nHungary earlier this week dropped its objections to an EU loan to Kyiv after the partial unfreezing of financial supports for Budapest that had earlier been frozen over rule of law concerns.\n\n>> Showdown between Brussels and Budapest: The battle over Hungary's EU funds\n\n9:14am: Ukraine shot down 'all' 13 drones in Kyiv attack, says Zelensky\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday that Ukrainian air defence systems had shot down 13 Iranian-made kamikaze drones that targeted the capital Kyiv earlier in the day.\n\nRussia \"started this morning with 13 Shaheds ... all 13 were shot down by our Ukrainian air defence systems\", Zelensky said in a video address on social media, referring to Iranian-made suicide drones that Moscow has been accused of deploying against targets in Ukraine.\n\n\"Thankfully, the authorities are saying there are no casualties,\" says FRANCE 24 correspondent Gulliver Cragg, who brings us the latest from the ground in this report:\n\n02:57 france24\n\n6:30am: Blasts heard in central Kyiv\n\nThe mayor of Kyiv is reporting multiple explosions in the Ukrainian capital, the first such blasts in weeks.\n\nVitaly Klitschko wrote in a post on Telegram that there were explosions in a central district of the capital that is home to many government agencies and buildings. He said municipal teams were in place and more details were expected.\n\nIn a separate post, Klitschko said air-defence systems had shot down 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones aiming for Kyiv.\n\n01:45 Anti-tank steel obstacles lay covered with snow along Independence Square in Kyiv on December 12, 2022. Sergei Supinsky, AFP\n\n1:42am: US finding grid equipment for Ukraine at home and abroad\n\nAs Washington sends Ukraine US-sourced power equipment to help the country's grid recover from Russian attacks, it is also scouring for those supplies worldwide, US officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Biden administration this week shipped the first portion of $53 million in power equipment aid it announced last month. The open market value is likely to be higher because utilities and manufacturers provided many items at cost and paid transportation costs.\n\n\"They were really quite forthcoming,\" an energy department official said about the suppliers, but noted that not all US equipment is compatible with Ukraine's grid.\n\n9:41pm, December 13: Zelensky says swath of Ukraine contaminated with mines\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday called for long-term help in clearing the nation of mines and other unexploded ordinance, which he said now cover an area roughly the size of Cambodia.\n\nIn a video address to New Zealand's parliament, Zelensky described Russia's nearly year-old invasion as an \"ecocide\" that would have lasting impact and implored Wellington and others to step up aid.\n\n\"As of now, 174,000 square kilometres (67,000 square miles) of Ukrainian territory are contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance,\" Zelensky told lawmakers.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and Reuters)\n\nFrance Mdias Monde graphic studio\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\nSome Russian troops are withdrawing from their positions in Ukraines southern region of Zaporizhzhia, according to Kyiv.\n\nRussian units have left the settlements of Mykhailivka, Polohy and Inzhenerne, all towns south of the city of Zaporizhzhia, the General Staff of the Ukrainian military said in its daily update Thursday.\n\nThe military added that the Kremlin is also preparing the evacuation of \"the personnel of the occupation administrations\" in the region.\n\nZaporizhzhia has been partially occupied by Russian forces since the outset of the invasion; in September Moscow illegally declared it and three other Ukrainian regions region to be Russian territory.\n\nFront lines in the region run for more than 100 miles across rolling farmland. Geolocated footage posted on Wednesday shows the aftermath of strikes on buildings in Polohy.\n\nOn the battlefield, the Ukrainians appear to be repeating actions they undertook further south in Kherson, namely striking bridges, supply hubs and Russian troop concentrations behind the front lines.\n\nUkrainian forces pushed into Kherson over recent months and liberated large swathes of the region, including Kherson city, after Russian troops withdrew east of the Dnipro River last month.\n\nThe General Staff said that in recent days their strikes on about half a dozen places had wounded more than 230 Russian soldiers and destroyed ammunition and equipment.\n\nCNN is unable to confirm the claims made by the General Staff.\n\nPowerful explosions have rocked the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in recent weeks, renewing concerns that fighting so close to the facility could cause a nuclear accident.\n\nOn November 20, UN nuclear experts at the plant said that more than a dozen blasts were heard within a short period of time. Shelling was observed both near and at the site of the facility.\n\nThe Director General of the UNs International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the plant by years end.\n\nIn an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica published Friday, Grossi said: \"My commitment is to reach a solution as soon as possible. I hope by the end of the year. I know that President Putin is following the process and I do not rule out another meeting with him soon, as well as with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\"\n\nThe developments come as the Russian military has started a census in some parts of occupied territory in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to the Ukrainian mayor-in-exile of the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol.\n\n\"Over the past few days, the Russians have been in a fuss. First, they were taking the wounded out of the hospital. Then they started a census in the towns of Mykhailivka and Burchak to allegedly prepare for evacuation,\" Ivan Fedorov said on national television Friday. The Ukrainian military also said that the occupation authorities are conducting a census in Burchak.\n\nMelitopol has been occupied by Russian forces since the early days of the invasion. Analysts have suggested that the next offensive front for the Ukrainians is likely to be a thrust southward toward it.\n\nThe General Staff said that elsewhere Russian forces continued to defend their positions in Luhansk region using tanks, mortars and artillery to prevent further advances of Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussian units were also shelling several settlements in recently liberated parts of Kherson region. But Ukrainian Brigadier General Oleksii Hromov claimed that last week that Russian forces had accidentally fired on their own unit near the village of Tsukury in Kherson, killing 14 servicemen. CNN cannot verify that claim.\n\nHromov said that Russian forces had gathered in the city of Dzankhoi in Crimea, which had \"actually turned into the largest military base on the territory from where the Russian occupation troops and weapons and military equipment of the Russian Armed Forces are redeployed.\"",

It is also a war that can become a full-fledged war that spreads into a major war between NATO and Russia,\" he said. \"We are working on that every day to avoid that.\"\n\nStoltenberg, a former prime minister of Norway, said in the interview that \"there is no doubt that a full-fledged war is a possibility,\" adding that it was important to avoid a conflict \"that involves more countries in Europe and becomes a full-fledged war in Europe.\"\n\n5:27pm: Russia is expanding its nuclear arsenal, US Defense Secretary says\n\nRussia is expanding and modernising its nuclear arsenal, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Friday, at a time when Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly suggested he could use nuclear weapons to protect Russia.\n\n\"And as the Kremlin continues its cruel and unprovoked war of choice against Ukraine, the whole world has seen Putin engage in deeply irresponsible nuclear saber-rattling,\" Austin said at a ceremony for the incoming commander of US Strategic Command, which oversees the United States' nuclear arsenal.\n\n5:02pm: Russia attempting to obtain more weapons from Iran, says British UN ambassador\n\nRussia is attempting to obtain more weapons from Iran, including hundreds of ballistic missiles, and offering Tehran an unprecedented level of military and technical support in return, Britain's UN Ambassador Barbara Woodward said on Friday.\n\n4:31pm: Ukrainian Nobel Prize winner says Putin must face tribunal\n\nA representative of one of the organisations sharing this year's Nobel Peace Prize said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin should face an international tribunal for the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nOleksandra Matviychuk of Ukraine's Center for Civil Liberties told a news conference in Oslo, Norway, that such a tribunal should be established to hold Putin, as well as Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko \"and other war criminals,\" accountable. Matviychuk called the conflict in Ukraine \"genocidal\" and said that \"if Ukraine stops resistance, there will be no more us.\"\n\nIn October, the Ukrainian group was named a co-winner of the 2022 peace price along with Russian human rights group Memorial and Ales Bialiatski, head of the Belarusian rights group Viasna. The triple peace prize was seen as a strong rebuke to Putin, not only for Russia's actions in Ukraine but for the Kremlin's crackdown on domestic opposition and its close ties with the authoritarian Lukashenko, who brutally suppressed protests in 2020 that erupted after a presidential election widely regarded as manipulated. Russia's Supreme Court shut down Memorial, one of Russias oldest and most prominent human rights organisations, in December 2021.\n\n4:23pm: A centre in Zaporizhzhia for displaced persons lacks supplies\n\nThe Ukrainian city of Enerhodar has been at the centre of international attention since Russian troops occupied its nuclear power station in March, shortly after the war began on February 24. Ukraine has since accused Russia of launching strikes towards the nearby Ukrainian towns of Zaporizhzhia and Nikopol from this sensitive area. The Russian occupation and fears of nuclear disaster have forced thousands of people to flee the city. Many of them have sought refuge at a centre for displaced persons in Zaporizhzhia.\n\nFRANCE 24s special correspondents Robert Parsons, Pauline Godart and Raid Abu Zaideh went to this centre to meet with some of the people staying there.\n\n02:27 About 70% of the population has left the town of Enerhodar.

I have said many times that we are ready for these agreements, and we are open\" to them, Putin said during a summit of regional leaders in the capital of Kyrgyzstan.\n\n3:09pm: Germany to send Skynex air defence systems to Ukraine\n\nGermany is to send two additional air defence systems to Ukraine of the type Skynex by Rheinmetall, the Handelsblatt daily reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources in Berlin.\n\nThe systems are to be delivered in early 2024, the report said.\n\n2:49pm: Putin threatens production cuts over oil price cap\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said Friday that Russia could reduce oil production in response to a $60 price cap on its oil exports agreed by Western nations over Moscow's Ukraine offensive.\n\n\"We will consider a possible reduction in production if necessary,\" Putin told reporters at a press conference in Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek following a regional summit, calling the price cap a \"stupid decision\" that is \"harmful to global energy markets\".\n\n2:45pm: Putin says Russia has no need for new round of mobilisation\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said there was no need to call up additional troops to fight in Ukraine, as there were 150,000 recently conscripted fighters who had not yet been sent to the frontlines.\n\nMoscow called up more than 300,000 reservists in a mobilisation drive in September and October, and Putin said on Wednesday that around half had been deployed to Ukraine.\n\nAlthough Putin has repeatedly said mobilisation is over, the Kremlin has refused to rescind an official decree ordering the call-ups, stoking fears that a second wave could be announced.\n\n1:35pm: Brittney Griner arrives home after Russia prisoner swap\n\nAmerican basketball star Brittney Griner has arrived in the United States after she was released from a Russian prison in exchange for arms dealer Viktor Bout, known as the \"Merchant of Death\".\n\nGriner, 32, who was arrested in Russia in February on drug charges, was seen by an AFP reporter walking across a runway after her plane landed in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nShe was expected to be transferred to a nearby military facility for medical checks, US media reported.\n\nWNBA star Brittney Griner pictured on board the plane that flew her out of Russia on December 8, 2022. Russian Federal Security Service via AP\n\n12:47pm: Russia and United States will keep discussing prisoner swaps, says deputy foreign minister\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Friday that Russia and the United States will continue to talk about possible prisoner swaps directly, without intermediaries, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.\n\nOn Thursday, the United States freed Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in exchange for American basketball player Brittney Griner, who had been jailed in Russia.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said Washington remains committed to also securing the return of imprisoned former marine Paul Whelan from Russia.\n\n12:10am: Putin critic found guilty of 'fake information' about Russian army\n\nRussian opposition politician Ilya Yashin has been found guilty of spreading \"fake information\" about the army, Russian news agencies report, with sentencing due later in the day.\n\nProsecutors are seeking a nine-year sentence for Yashin, a Moscow district councillor.\n\nYashin was tried over a YouTube video released in April in which he discussed evidence uncovered by Western journalists of Russian war crimes in Bucha, near Kyiv, and cast doubt on the official Moscow version that such reports had been fabricated.\n\nRussia passed new legislation after invading Ukraine on Feb. 24 that provides for jail terms of up to 15 years for disseminating \"false information\" about the military.\n\nIn his final statement to the court this week, Yashin appealed directly to President Vladimir Putin, describing him as \"the person responsible for this slaughter\" and asking him to \"stop this madness\".\n\n11:45am: Ukrainians seek aid, shelter in shadow of Russia-occupied nuclear plant\n\nThe Ukrainian city of Enerhodar has been at the centre of international attention since Russian troops occupied its nuclear power station in March soon after the start of the war. Ukraine has since accused Russia of using the territory of the station to fire at the nearby Ukranian towns of Zaporizhzhia and Nikopol.\n\nThe harsh terms of the Russian occupation and fear of nuclear disaster have forced thousands of people to flee the city. Many of them have sought refuge in Zaporizhzhia, where FRANCE 24 reporters Robert Parsons, Pauline Godart and Raid Abu Zaideh have been to a centre for internal displaced persons to discover how they are coping.\n\n02:28\n\n10:15am: TotalEnergies quits Russian gas firm's board, taking $3.7 billion hit\n\nFrench oil and gas giant TotalEnergies says it is withdrawing its two members from Novatek's board and will take a $3.7 billion hit in its fourth-quarter accounts for the write-down of its stake in the Russian company.\n\nUnlike London-based rivals BP and Shell, TotalEnergies has held on to several investments in Russia after the country invaded Ukraine, and faced criticism for doing so.\n\nAmong its Russian investments are a 19.4% stake in gas producer Novatek and minority holdings in liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG.\n\n\"In view of the European sanctions in force since the beginning of the war, the two directors representing TotalEnergies on the board of directors of Novatek are led to abstain from voting in meetings of the board of directors of this company, in particular on financial matters,\" a statement from the company said.\n\n\"Under these circumstances, the board of directors of TotalEnergies has decided to withdraw the representatives of the company from the board of PAO Novatek with immediate effect.\"\n\n9:40am: Griner-Bout swap not a sign of improving relations, Kremlin says\n\nThe deal to swap Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for US basketball star Brittney Griner should not be seen as a step towards improving bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington, the Kremlin has warned.\n\n\"The talks were exclusively on the topic of the exchange. It's probably wrong to draw any hypothetical conclusions that this may be a step towards overcoming the crisis in bilateral relations,\" the TASS news agency has quoted the Kremlin's press office as saying.\n\n\"Bilateral relations remain in a sorry state,\" the Russian presidency added.\n\n9:30am: Putin says West's desire for global dominance stokes conflicts\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has blamed the West's desire to maintain its dominance on the world stage for increasing the risks of conflict.\n\n\"The potential for conflict in the world is growing and this is a direct consequence of the attempts by Western elites to preserve their political, financial, military and ideological dominance by any means,\" Putin said in a video message to a summit of defence ministers from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.\n\n\"They deliberately multiply chaos and aggravate the international situation,\" Putin said.\n\nThe Russian leader has repeatedly cast the war in Ukraine as a conflict between Russia and the West, criticising those who have provided military and financial backing to Ukraine.\n\n8:45am: US sports world overjoyed at Brittney Griner's release\n\nBrittney Griner's former coaches and teammates as well as a host of elite athletes have celebrated the US basketball star's release from a Russian prison after 10 months of captivity. FRANCE 24's Washington correspondent Kethevane Gorjestani has the details.\n\n01:30\n\n6:50am: US to send Ukraine anti-drone, air defence aid worth $275 million\n\nThe United States is preparing to send Ukraine a 275-million-dollar (260 million) military aid package offering new capabilities to defeat drones and strengthen air defences, according to a document seen by Reuters and people familiar with the package.\n\nThe Pentagon is also expected to include rockets for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers made by Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N, 155mm ammunition, Humvee military vehicles and generators, according to the people and the document.\n\nA National Security Council spokesperson declined to comment on the aid package. The contents and size of aid packages can shift until they are signed by the president.\n\nThe $275 million will be covered by Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) which allows the United States to transfer defence articles and services from stocks quickly without congressional approval in response to an emergency.\n\n4:35am: Brittney Griner heads home after prisoner swap\n\nAmerican basketball star Brittney Griner was headed back to the United States on Thursday after being released from a Russian prison in exchange for an arms dealer known as the \"Merchant of Death\".\n\nGriner, 32, who was arrested in Russia in February on drug charges, and Viktor Bout, 55, who was serving a 25-year sentence in a US prison, were exchanged at an airport in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn footage released by Russian state media, Griner, shorn of her distinctive dreadlocks, and a relaxed and animated Bout could be seen crossing paths on the airport tarmac and heading towards the planes that would take them home.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced Griner's release in an address to the nation at the White House. \"She is safe. She is on a plane. She is on her way home,\" he said.\n\nThe president said he had spoken to her and she was in \"good spirits\" after suffering \"needless trauma\".\n\n01:59\n\n10:35pm: Russia deploying rocket launchers near Ukraine nuclear reactor\n\nRussian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine's shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nUkraine's nuclear company Energoatom said in a statement that Russian forces occupying the plant have placed several Grad multiple rocket launchers near one of its six nuclear reactors, which are all shut down. It said the offensive systems are located at new \"protective structures\" the Russians secretly built, \"violating all conditions for nuclear and radiation safety\".\n\nThe claim could not be independently verified.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and Reuters)\n\nFrance Mdias Monde graphic studio\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

It means that any missiles which could fly, lets say, up to 2,000 kilometres, could reach any nuclear reactor.\"\n\nCrazy game\n\nSince Zaporizhzhias capture, Galushchenko said Moscows forces have continued shelling power lines connecting the plant to Ukraines energy grid. The power plant has gone into blackout mode \"five times\", he added.\n\nHis main worry is that a nuclear power plant needs a constant power supply to cool the fuel.\n\nIf it gets disconnected, it could be a \"classic Fukushima scenario\", Galushchenko said, referring to the 2011 disaster in Japan.\n\n\"They shell Ukrainians lines, destroy the lines, then the station starts on diesel generators and it means you are one step ahead of an accident,\" he said.\n\nBut even after the power lines have been repaired and the electricity supply to the plant resumed, the worrying process begins once more with the start of fresh shelling, Galuschenko said.\n\n\"This is a crazy game around nuclear security,\" he said.\n\nSince October, Russia has switched tactics and begun airstrikes targeting Ukraines energy network plunging millions into cold and darkness at the onset of winter.\n\nThe conference in France will focus on ways in which Ukraines Western allies can provide immediate support to keep the countrys civil infrastructure functioning amid incessant bombing.\n\nUkraine is dependent on nuclear power for more than 50 percent of its electricity.\n\nDespite the alarm over Zaporizhzhias situation, the country has no intention of giving up its use of nuclear power, Galushchenko said.\n\n\"But we need to think on military threats and that is absolutely new not even for us, but also as the world, this is something we should think about together,\" he told AFP.\n\nby Claudine RENAUD",

All times EST.\n\n10:09 p.m.: Ukraine should continue to fight Russian troops, the leader of a Ukrainian rights group that won the Nobel Peace Prize said on Friday, adding that any attempt to enter into talks to end the war would be interpreted by Russia as a sign of weakness, Reuters reported.\n\nUkraine's Center for Civil Liberties, Russian rights group Memorial and jailed Belarusian activist Ales Byalyatski won the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAsked whether Ukraine and the West should enter into talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war, the leader of the Ukrainian rights group said Kyiv would \"never leave our people for torture and death in occupied territories.\"\n\n\"So the West has to help Ukraine to resist and to liberate all temporary occupied territories, including Crimea,\" Oleksandra Matviichuk told a news conference in Oslo. The award ceremony will be held Saturday.\n\n\"The logic of authoritarian leaders is very understandable: they see any attempt (at) dialogue as a sign of weakness.\"\n\nFounded in 2007, the group aims to document every single war crime committed across Ukraine.\n\nThis year's Nobel Peace Prize, the first since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, recognizes the efforts of civil society to stand up against authoritarian states and human rights abuses, the Norwegian Nobel committee has said.\n\n8:40 p.m.: Russia's finance ministry on Friday said the government had spent $4.8 billion from the National Wealth Fund (NWF) in November on financing the budget deficit, as Russia diverts more money to its military campaign in Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nThe ministry had said in October it was drawing down about $16 billion from the NWF, Russia's rainy day fund, with a view to spending it to help cover the budget deficit forecast to reach around 2% of GDP this year and next.\n\nThe NWF stood at $186.5 billion as of December 1, equivalent to 8.5% of Russia's projected gross domestic product for this year.\n\n7:35 p.m.:\n\n6:40 p.m.: Russia is expanding and modernizing its nuclear arsenal, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Friday at a time when Russian President Vladimir Putin, faced with setbacks in Ukraine, has repeatedly suggested he could use nuclear weapons, Reuters reported.\n\nAustin's comments are in line with a recent Pentagon policy document on nuclear arms.\n\nRussia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, with close to 6,000 warheads, according to experts.

However, the situation can change at any moment, they cautioned.\n\n1:45 p.m.: In March, Russian forces occupied the Izyum Baking Products Integrated Factory, a leading producer of animal feed in Ukraine.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n1:25 p.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a statement Friday saying that the United States is imposing sanction on Russian entities involved in buying military drones from Iran.\n\n\"Today, we are imposing sanctions on three Russian entities connected to Moscow's growing military relationship with Tehran a relationship that includes the transfer of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) from Iran,\" Blinken said. \"The Kremlin is deploying these UAVs against Ukraine, including in large-scale attacks on civilian infrastructure.\"\n\n\"Russia's acquisition and Iran's provision of these certain UAVs are in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2231 and further fuels the conflict in Ukraine,\" he said. \"The United States will continue to use every tool at our disposal to disrupt these transfers and impose consequences on those engaged in this activity,\" he added.\n\n1:10 p.m.: Russia is attempting to obtain more weapons from Iran, including hundreds of ballistic missiles, and offering Tehran an unprecedented level of military and technical support in return, Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said on Friday.\n\nSince August Iran has transferred hundreds of drones - also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - to Russia, which had used them to \"kill civilians and illegally target civilian infrastructure\" in Ukraine, Woodward said, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Russia is now attempting to obtain more weapons, including hundreds of ballistic missiles,\" Woodward told reporters.\n\n\"In return, Russia is offering Iran an unprecedented level of military and technical support. We're concerned that Russia intends to provide Iran with more advanced military components, which will allow Iran to strengthen their weapons capability,\" she said.\n\nShe also said that Britain was \"almost certain that Russia is seeking to source weaponry from North Korea (and) other heavily sanctioned states, as their own stocks palpably dwindle.\"\n\n1:00 p.m.:\n\n12:45 p.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would likely have to reach agreements regarding Ukraine in the future, but felt betrayed by the breakdown of the Minsk agreements, Reuters reported Friday.\n\nPutin said Germany and France - which brokered ceasefire agreements in the Belarusian capital Minsk between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and 2015 - had betrayed Russia and were now pumping Ukraine with weapons.\n\nIn an interview published in Germany's Zeit magazine on Wednesday, former German chancellor Angela Merkel said that the Minsk agreements had been an attempt to \"give Ukraine time\" to build up its defenses.\n\nSpeaking on Friday at a news conference in Kyrgyzstan, Putin said he was \"disappointed\" by Merkel's comments.\n\n12:30 p.m.: A day after one of the most high-profile prisoner exchanges between Washington and Moscow in years, Russian authorities have deported U.S. citizen Sarah Krivanek, who spent almost one year in detention on charges of assaulting her Russian partner.

Russia did not immediately comment on the allegations.\n\nKyiv has accused Russia of putting pressure on Ukrainian employees at the plant to sign contracts with Russia's nuclear energy company.

He said it was a technical meeting and should not be seen as a sign the two sides were ready to resume discussing \"major issues\".\n\nBoth the Russian embassy in Washington and the U.S. embassy in Moscow have been cut back significantly in recent years in a series of tit-for-tat expulsions that have seen dozens of Russian and U.S. diplomats sent back to their home countries.\n\n8:55 a.m.: When Ukrainians returned to the village of Snihurivka after it was liberated from Russian forces, they found some unpleasant surprises in their homes. Current Time, a co-production of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and VOA, has this report.\n\n8:40 a.m.: The U.S. is sending an additional $275 million in military aid to Ukraine, including large amounts of ammunition and high-tech systems that can be used to detect and counter drones in its ongoing war with Russia, The Associated Press reported Friday, quoting U.S. officials.\n\nThe total aid amount is smaller than most of the recent packages the U.S. has delivered, and it comes as many military officials and experts predict a reduction in attacks during the winter. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia appears to be slowing its military activities to regroup and launch a new offensive when the weather warms.\n\nThe officials said the latest package of aid includes 80,000 rounds of ammunition for howitzers and an undisclosed amount of ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS.

Yashin, 39, was tried over a YouTube video released in April in which he discussed evidence uncovered by Western journalists of Russian atrocities in Ukraine, and cast doubt on the official Moscow version that such reports had been fabricated as a \"provocation\" against Russia.\n\n8:10 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he believes \"mine terror\" will be one of the charges against Russia when it is held to account for its invasion of Ukraine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported Friday.\n\n\"I am sure this will be among the charges against Russia for aggression,\" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address on Thursday.\n\nZelenskyy said the use of mines is even more cruel than the use of missiles because mines cannot be shot out of the air. He said Russian mines are a legacy of terror that Ukraine will have to contend with for years.\n\nThe Ukrainian Interior Ministry said last month that approximately one-third of the territory of Ukraine remains potentially dangerous due to explosive objects.\n\nAt the end of October, Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskiy said that, in the territories recently liberated from the Russian Army, mining is twice as dense as in the previously de-occupied part of the Kyiv region or Chernihiv region.\n\n7:55 a.m.:\n\n7:40 a.m.: Ahead of elections next year in Poland, Jaroslaw Kaczynski and the nationalist conservative ruling party that he leads have been lashing out against Germany while seeking to cast their main competitor as loyal to Berlin, The Associated Press reported.\n\nPolands ruling party leader claims Germany seeks to dominate Europe. He warns that Poles could end up under the \"German heel.\" He snubs a German offer of anti-missile systems before Poland eventually accepts them but gets in an anti-German dig along the way.\n\nMany Poles, like others in central Europe, have been critical of Germanys stance toward Russia in the years leading up to Russias February 24 invasion of Ukraine, particularly for gas deals that created dependence on Russian energy and helped Russia build up its war chest.\n\nBut critics of the ruling party, Law and Justice, say its anti-German rhetoric is becoming a threat to Polands national interests and risks creating a crack between Western allies while Russia wages war in Ukraine.\n\n7:20 a.m.:\n\n7:05 a.m.: The number of oil tankers waiting in the Black Sea to pass through Istanbul's Bosphorus Strait on the way to the Mediterranean rose to 20 on Friday, Tribeca shipping agency said, as Turkey held talks to resolve an insurance dispute behind the build-up, Reuters reported.\n\nDismissing pressure from abroad over the lengthening queue, Turkey's maritime authority said on Thursday it would continue to block oil tankers that lacked the appropriate insurance letters, and it needed time for checks.\n\n6:55 a.m.:\n\n6:40 a.m.: Russian forces pounded the entire front line in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk and Luhansk, the General Staff of the Ukrainian military said on Friday, as U.S. officials said that Washington was preparing to send Ukraine a $275 million military aid package containing new capabilities to defeat drones and strengthen air defenses, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nUkrainian forces repelled dozens of Russian attacks in the Bilohoryivka area in Luhansk as well as Klishchyivka and Maryinka in the Donetsk region, the General Staff said in its daily update.\n\nThe fiercest fighting continued near the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiyivka in Donetsk, regional Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a television interview. Artillery slammed into the town of Toretsk southwest of Bakhmut, killing one civilian and damaging 12 buildings, Kyrylenko said.\n\n\"The entire front line is being shelled,\" he said, adding that Russians were also trying to advance near Lyman, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces last month in one of a number of setbacks suffered by Moscow since invading its neighbor in February.\n\nIn Bakhmut and other parts of the Donetsk region, Ukrainian forces countered with barrages from rocket launchers, witnesses said.\n\n6:25 a.m.:\n\n6:10 a.m.: WNBA star Brittney Griners 10-month imprisonment in Russia on drug charges came to an end on Thursday, spreading relief and joy across the sports world and beyond, The Associated Press reported.\n\nIts unknown if and when she might return to a basketball court. But if she does, womens basketball will get back a generational talent.\n\nOn the court, Griner was a dominant force in leading Baylor to the 2012 NCAA championship, then went onto stardom as a lanky anchor for the WNBAs Phoenix Mercury and as a two-time Olympic gold medalist with Team USA.\n\n5:50 a.m.: Brittney Griner returned to the United States early Friday, nearly 10 months after the basketball stars detention in Russia made her the most high-profile American jailed abroad and set off a political firestorm.\n\n5:35 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday said the West's desire to maintain its dominance on the world stage was increasing the risks of conflict, Reuters reported.\n\n\"The potential for conflict in the world is growing and this is a direct consequence of the attempts by Western elites to preserve their political, financial, military and ideological dominance by any means,\" Putin said.\n\nThe Russian leader was speaking in a video message to a summit of defence ministers from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and a group of ex-Soviet countries that was published by the Kremlin.\n\n5:26 a.m.:\n\n4:26 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that Russian forces reinforced positions near Svatove and conducted counterattacks near Kreminna amid continued Ukrainian counteroffensive operations in eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces also continued offensive operations in the Bakhmut and AvdiivkaDonetsk City areas.\n\n3:26 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said that for the first time in three weeks, there have been reports of attacks by Iran-made drones.\n\n\"These events remain to be verified, but it is likely that Russia exhausted its previous stock of several hundred Shahed-131s and 136s and has now received a resupply,\" the update said.\n\n2:12 a.m.: The U.S. Army awarded two contracts to increase production capacity for the type of artillery shells Ukrainian soldiers have been using in vast quantities, the Army said Thursday, as the United States seeks to replenish munitions sent to support Kyiv, Reuters reported.\n\nA contract to build a new component production line in Texas and another contract for making shell bodies were awarded to two companies in late November, the Army said.\n\nThey represent some of the first resources the Army has invested to increase production capacity for 155mm ammunition, a NATO-standard round, after U.S. aid to Ukraine drew from American stocks after Russia invaded its neighbor in February.\n\n1:09 a.m.: One of Turkey's most influential marine biologists is pleading for the creation of an \"ecological corridor\" to save dolphins and other sea creatures from destruction during Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nBayram Ozturk spoke to Agence France-Presse one day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of waging an \"ecocide\" that was devastating marine life across the Black Sea.\n\nOzturk, the head of the Turkish Marine Research Foundation wants the world to take a closer look at the damage that has been done.\n\n\"We need international surveillance. We need to know what is happening exactly,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\nHis biggest immediate worry is that fighting this winter will interrupt the natural migration period of dolphins across the Black Sea.\n\n\"There should be an ecological corridor starting from the Danube River to the Odessa area, where there's a highly concentrated dolphins population,\" he said of a region near Ukraine's southwestern border with Romania.\n\n12:02 a.m.: South Africa's leading opposition party on Thursday called on the government to explain why a Russian cargo ship that it said was under western sanctions had docked at a Cape Town naval base, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThe vessel arrived at Simon's Town, South Africa's largest naval base, on Tuesday, the Democratic Alliance (DA) party said, adding it seemed to have turned off its automatic identification system, which provides the ship's position and other information.\n\nAt night, cranes had been offloading cargo from it and onto trucks protected by armed personnel, it added.\n\nSouth Africa has resisted taking sides following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a war that has triggered sweeping Western sanctions.\n\nThe South Africa defense ministry and the navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe ship, identified by local media as the Lady R, flies a Russian flag and is en route from Cameroon to Tanzania, according to vessel tracking websites.\n\nSome information in this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

                "summary": "Russia's refusal to accept the G7 and EU oil price cap could lead to a reduction in its oil exports, as the cap prevents Russian crude from being shipped using key global shipping and insurance companies based in G7 countries unless it is sold at or below the cap (1,2). This could result in Russia potentially cutting production if it opts not to sell oil at the capped price, which would impact its global market share and foreign currency earnings that have historically been significant since the discovery of oil and gas in Siberia post-World War Two (2). The potential decrease in Russian oil on the global market may tighten supply and drive up prices, affecting the global economy (3). Overcompliance with the sanctions by traders, insurers, or shipping firms could exacerbate the supply reduction, further influencing global oil prices (4).",
                "more_detailed": "Russia's adamant refusal to recognize the Western-imposed oil price cap of $60 per barrel is poised to significantly reshape its oil export strategy and potentially impact its global market share. In response to the cap, which is enforced by the G7 and the EU's leverage over key shipping and insurance services, Russia has threatened to halt oil exports to nations complying with the measures, even if it necessitates a reduction in production (1,2,6). This stance suggests Russia may intensify efforts to seek alternative markets, primarily in Asia, to compensate for the loss of Western buyers, as the EU's ban on seaborne Russian oil imports further constricts traditional trade avenues (8). \n\nThe global oil market is likely to experience volatility due to Russia's decision and the new sanctions. If Russia follows through on its threats to cut oil production or withhold exports from participating countries, the reduced supply could lead to an increase in oil prices, affecting the global market (1,4). However, with Russia's oil already being sold at a discount and the country's production levels not showing a significant decrease, the actual impact on its market share and global oil prices remains uncertain (7,10). The situation is further complicated by the possibility of overcompliance from companies avoiding engagement with Russian oil below the cap, which could exacerbate supply reductions (4)."

As sanctions on oil exports from Venezuela, Iran, and now Russia, have fostered an underground oil trade, the recent measures are likely to further incentivize vessel owners, shipping firms, and traders to engage in sanction-evading activities to sell Russian oil to willing buyers (1). Additionally, Russia's refusal to comply with the price cap and its readiness to cut production rather than sell oil below the set cap may lead to intensified competition among Russian producers and with other suppliers, potentially resulting in lower prices to attract buyers (4).\n\nThe potential impact of the price cap on global oil prices and energy market stability remains uncertain. Some analysts predict that the cap, along with the EU's ban on Russian seaborne crude, could strain the global market by reducing Russian oil supply and drive up gas prices (3). Others suggest that Russia might circumvent the cap, maintaining its oil export rates and thus mitigating effects on gas prices (3). The Kremlin has stated it will not sell oil to countries enforcing the cap, which could lead to increased oil prices and destabilize energy markets according to Russian officials (5,7,10). The Western strategy of capping Russian oil profits as a response to the Ukraine conflict adds another layer of complexity to the already volatile energy landscape, with potential repercussions for both legal and illicit oil trade dynamics (3,7)."

The OPEC+ group's decision to stick with its current production targets could potentially amplify the effects of the Western sanctions on the global oil market, as it could result in further supply constraints, especially if Russia cuts back its oil exports in retaliation (3,5). The interaction of these two factors\u2014OPEC+'s production policies and the Western price cap\u2014could, therefore, contribute to increased volatility and upward pressure on oil prices in the near term (7,10)."

The EU's ban on imports of Russian seaborne oil and the G7's price cap are significant moves aiming to pressure Moscow but carry the risk of tightening the global oil supply and potentially driving up prices (2,7).\n\nThe oil price cap also allows major Russian oil buyers, such as India and China, to potentially negotiate lower prices, which could impact the effectiveness of the cap (3). Analysts and policymakers are uncertain about the long-term effects of the cap on oil prices, especially since Russia has been selling oil at discounted rates already (7). The cap's success is contingent on the willingness of major global shippers and insurers, predominantly based within the G7, to enforce it, as well as the ability of the EU and its partners to navigate the potential economic repercussions without significant disruption to the global energy markets (1,2,3,6)."

The EU and UK have joined in banning Russian oil, adding to the pressure on Russia's energy sector (1). OPEC+, including Russia, has agreed to maintain its current production reduction, which could mitigate some of the supply risks by ensuring market stability (2). Furthermore, the G7 and EU's strategy includes the objective of depriving Russia of the funds necessary to sustain its military efforts, aiming to deter the country's aggression while attempting to maintain global energy supply and economic stability (4,5).",
                "more_detailed": "In response to Russia's warning to halt oil shipments to countries adhering to the $60 price cap, the G7 and EU could explore alternative policies aimed at reducing Russian oil revenues without solely relying on the price cap strategy (6,7). One such policy could involve the imposition of import tariffs on Russian oil, which has been favored by some European policy analysts over the price cap, as it could potentially cut Russia's oil revenues while still allowing for some degree of oil trade with Russia (7). Additionally, the G7, alongside Australia and the EU, has indicated a willingness to consider further actions to ensure the effectiveness of the price cap, which may include adjustment mechanisms to keep the cap below market prices or other economic measures yet to be detailed (10).\n\nTo mitigate the potential risks associated with Russia's threats, the G7 and EU can leverage well-established economic tools as well as novel approaches that push the boundaries of economic statecraft (4). The Treasury Department's objectives to deprive Russia of the means to wage war, prevent military power projection, and denounce war crimes could serve as guiding principles for developing these strategies (4). Furthermore, the G7 and EU could strengthen their multilateral approach to sanctions by coordinating with countries that have either banned Russian oil imports or are in the process of phasing them out, ensuring a more united front against Russia's actions (9). This multilateral coordination could help stabilize global energy supplies while still limiting Russian oil revenues (9)."

More context: On Friday, G7 nations and Australia agreed on a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil. The West's biggest economies agreed earlier this year to establish a price cap after lobbying by the United States, and vowed to hash out the details by early December. But settinga number hadproved difficult. Capping the price of Russian oil between $65 and $70 a barrel, a range previously under discussion, wouldn't have caused much pain for the Kremlin. Urals crude, Russia's benchmark, has already been trading within or close to that range. EU countries such as Poland and Estonia had pushed for the cap to be lower. A price of $60 represents a discount of almost $27 to Brent crude, the global benchmark. Urals has been trading at discounts of around $23 in recent days. Reuters reported that the EU agreement included a mechanism to adjust the level of the cap to ensure it was always 5% below the market rate. The risk of settling on a lower price is that Russia could retaliate by slashing its output, which would roil markets. Russia previously warned that it will stop supplying countries that adhere to the cap.",

But one thing is clear: to even have a chance at compliance, organizations must be proactive in executing due diligence and detecting related deceptive shipping practices (DSPs).\n\nBackground and challenges\n\nRussian forces invaded Ukraine in a full-scale assault that started on February 24 and created global shock waves. Economic sanctions had already been imposed days prior to the invasion and have since escalated.\n\nImage 1: Timeline of sanctions imposed on Russian exports and oil since the beginning of the war\n\nA new set of extended regulations by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the European Union (EU) will come into effect on December 5, 2022. These bodies established an embargo and a limiting price cap on all Russian seaborne oil trade. The new ban is designed to accomplish two goals that will likely be difficult to coordinate and reconcile: ensure the continued flow of Russian oil into the global market so as not to worsen the precarious global economic situation, while maintaining pressure on Russia by limiting the price for the supply and delivery of the oil.\n\nWhile only traders and importers have direct access to the price of the transactions, the restrictions and price cap apply to all shipping stakeholders across the supply chain, including financial institutions, shipping companies, and insurance brokers. This creates a challenging dependency on counterparties to obtain sufficient evidence for the legitimacy of the deal.\n\nApart from the dependency on others for price proof, shipping stakeholders now face other challenges following the December 5 go-live date.\n\nAccording to Vortexa, a company providing real-time information and analytics for crude oil and refined oil product flows, one of these challenges is that Russia will require more than 200 tankers to export its oil to the four countries that will still be able to accept it China, India, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Turkey.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether there will be a two-tiered fleet:\n\n1. Western/global; 2. Dark Fleet\n\nOr a three-tiered fleet:\n\n1. Western; 2. Dark fleet; 3. Those who maintain ambiguity.\n\nThe third category has been prevalent in Venezuela trade, with a few Greek vessels sanctioned in 2020 by the Trump administration.\n\nThe four legitimate destinations mentioned above are further away than Europe, meaning that there likely will not be enough available oil tankers to extract the oil from Russia and complete the lengthy voyages. During the winter, more ice vessels will be needed, too.\n\nThis may cause freight and oil rates to rise, and the effort to extract all the needed oil from Russia will inevitably lead to more ship-to-ship (STS) operations that will occur in known and new hot spots.\n\nWhile STS operations can be completely legitimate in the maritime industry, a sharp increase in the number of such meetings in specific areas opens a window for illicit actors to conceal illegal activities. Windwards insights show that while seasonality trends of the global STS operations between Russian-affiliated tankers remained the same when comparing 2020-2021 to 2021-2022, the volume of such operations dramatically increased since the beginning of the war.\n\nImage 2: A rise in STS volume in 2021-2022\n\nSTS operations are not the only thing stakeholders need to be aware of with the implementation of the price cap. In addition to the price attestation, companies must optimize their due diligence processes to check for any ownership changes; determine who is the ultimate beneficial owner (UBO); and detect dark activity, GNSS manipulations, first-time visits, and voyage anomalies.\n\nThese can be directly related to the much-discussed shadow fleet (vessels that officially do not exist) that poses a real risk to organizations. Orgs cannot do much about the shadow fleet, since the vessels lack of registration makes tracking extremely difficult and an obstacle to full compliance. By monitoring the above behaviors, users can track their counterparties and the vessels they are meeting with to identify any suspicious draft changes and flag vessels trying to hide in plain sight.\n\nEven if there is a price attestation in place and everything is seemingly above board and legal, actionable insights and real-time alerts for such high-risk behaviors are valuable, and can prevent reputational/financial risk by enabling visibility:\n\nBeyond the price of the trade\n\nInto the organizations involved in potential transactions\n\nInto the origin of the oil being shipped/financed/insured\n\nFirst Russia-related GNSS manipulation shows price caps complexity\n\nOne recent example of hiding in plain sight and the complexity of determining who may be carrying Russian crude oil is a crude oil tanker sailing under the Cameroon flag. When looking at the operational history of this vessel, there is seemingly nothing illegal about its behavior, and no Russia connection.\n\nImage 3: Vessel profile of the crude oil tanker, showing it has been high risk since July 2022, following its first GNSS event\n\nIn September of 2022, according to Windwards Maritime AITM technology, the vessel started to behave irregularly. With an unknown beneficial owner since 2021, the vessel changed its registered owner to a Seychelles-based company in June 2022. One month later, the vessel changed its name, call sign, and MMSI, followed by a first-time visit to Cape Verde.\n\nDuring this first-time visit to Cape Verde, the vessel did not call port and only met with a few other vessels, and anchored for a few days. About two weeks after the vessel first entered the area, it made another first-time movement toward the North Mid-Atlantic. It stayed there for three days and then continued to the South Atlantic area, where it engaged in a first GNSS manipulation event, just off the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Namibia.\n\nImage 4: GNSS manipulation event off the Namibia EEZ\n\nThe vessel finally moved away from the area of manipulation in mid-October, only to engage in a second GNSS manipulation event within the Angola EEZ on October 21. During this second event, the tanker transmitted for six days straight from the exact same coordinate unnatural behavior for a tanker at sea.\n\nImage 5: Transmitting for six days straight from the same coordinates, the vessel reappeared again on October 28, 86 nautical miles from its last transmission point\n\nThis is notable, as the Mid-North Atlantic is a known hub for dark activities and STS engagements, with vessels arriving from Russia loaded with Russian oil. Windward has also identified the beginning of a shift of the dark activities from the Mid-North Atlantic region to a more Southern area of the Atlantic. The monthly average of both dark activities and STS operations in the South Atlantic doubled in September-November 2022 compared to the monthly average of the previous three months (June-August 2022).\n\nImage 6: Dark activities by Russian tankers\n\nThis behavioral shift is aligned with the starting point of this vessels GNSS manipulation. The vessel moved away from the area of manipulation seven days later, and started its journey towards Asia, following the Windward-identified path for smuggled Russian oil from the Cape of Good Hope, through the Malacca straits, to Asia. The vessel is currently sailing to its final destination, Tanjung Bruas port in Malaysia.\n\nImage 7: The vessel sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, through the Malacca straits, on its way to Asia\n\nWhy is this noteworthy? The vessel reported a draft change from 10.0 to 20.9 on November 20 with no official port call or STS operation to back it up. This suggests that the vessel loaded oil during its GNSS manipulation timeframe, in an area known for smuggling Russian oil.\n\nSo while this vessel was cleared for business up until its GNSS manipulation in July, and is not Russian-affiliated it is more than reasonable to assume that it is carrying smuggled Russian oil at the time of the publication of this Windward report. Stakeholders providing services to this vessel after December 5, might not even ask for a price attestation, as there is no affiliation to Russia. This potentially exposes them to both financial and reputational risk.\n\nUncertainty and unanswered questions\n\nThe activities of the vessel described above highlight the ambiguities and gray areas around the implementation of the price cap. As described in the introduction of this report, there are still many unanswered questions, such as:\n\n1. Will Russias political leaders and government accept the price cap, or actively work to circumvent it?\n\n2. Will the four countries that can legally accept Russian crude oil do so? Or will they shy away to mitigate reputational damage?\n\n3. Who is going to enforce adherence to the regulators set price?\n\n4. Will Europe fold if its a challenging, particularly cold winter?\n\nWe do not yet know the answers to these questions. But as a trusted advisor to many throughout the maritime ecosystem, Windward will be closely monitoring the price cap implementation and using our Maritime AITM technology to discover new tactics and behavioral trends that may develop as means to disguise the origin of the regulated Russian oil.\n\nBen Cahill, Senior Fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, notes that the oil price cap will likely cause deceptive shipping practices (DSPs) to proliferate and will create new challenges:\n\n\"Market players manage to evade sanctions on Iranian and Venezuelan oil through ship-to-ship transfers, illicit tanker trade, and crude blending. Refiners and other buyers will probably find ways to beat the proposed requirements for trading Russian oil. They may seek letters of credit from multiple banks or use several subsidiaries to document deals at the approved price, while paying more in reality. The oil market is full of clever, rapacious people with strong incentives to bend or break rules. If the price cap is imposed, economic theory will collide with the messy reality of the market.\"\n\nAs Ben Cahill describes it, the new price cap restrictions mark the next step in the evolution of sanctions compliance and related DSPs. Presumably, all parties are expected to undertake reasonable due diligence based on available information, but due to the many ways one can conceal the true price of the trade, price attestation alone might not be enough. As of the day of this publication, there are +1000 medium risk and +700 high risk Russian-affiliated vessels flagged in our system, and following December 5 this number is expected to increase. Screening each and every one of these is not scalable or practical when trying to run business as usual.\n\nThis article appears courtesy of maritime predictive intelligence company Windward.",

MOL, Hungary's main oil and gas group, has said the price cap was unsustainable as major players stopped importing fuel due to low prices, aggravating the shortage.\n\n\"In the past days, the oil sanctions of Brussels took effect and what we had been afraid of, has actually happened. From now on there are sanctions prices on petrol across entire Europe,\" Orban said on Facebook, adding his government would redirect 'extra profits' earned on higher prices to the state budget.\n\nLate on Wednesday, a government decree showed oil companies would have to pay a 95% special tax rate on the Brent-Ural spread as of Thursday, up from 40% previously, sharply hiking the existing windfall tax to plug budget holes.\n\nRe-elected for a fourth straight term in April, nationalist Orban is facing his toughest economic challenge to date, with inflation running above 20%, the economy headed for stagnation and the forint currency down 10% versus the euro this year.\n\nOrban said last week he would continue efforts to shield households from soaring energy costs in 2023 although a surge in European gas prices has already forced the nationalist premier to curtail a years-long cap on household utility bills.\n\nCentral bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy warned Orban in unusually blunt terms on Monday to scrap all caps on fuel, various foods and interest rates, saying the economy was in a precarious state, with inflation still on the rise.\n\nMOL, where third-quarter net profit more than doubled to 262.1 billion forints ($672.59 million), has paid a 40% special tax on the Brent-Ural spread since the end of July.\n\nIts shares finished trade 2.6% lower on Wednesday, reversing early gains of around 3% after the fuel price cap was ditched overnight and dragging the wider Budapest benchmark lower.\n\nWith Orban's government still haggling with the EU over rule-of-law conditions attached to billions of euros worth of recovery funds, the central bank is burning through its international reserves to ease pressure on the forint from Hungary's rising energy import bills.\n\nEurasia Group's Mujtaba Rahman noted that worries over the dispute with Brussels pushed the currency to an all-time low in October.\n\n\"Failure to make a deal stick would surely push the Forint even beyond this previous low, with a resultant negative impact on inflation given Hungary's dependence on imported gas, oil and other raw materials,\" he said.\n\n($1 = 389.69 forints)\n\nReporting by Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs; Editing by Toby Chopra, Kirsten Donovan and Deepa Babington\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Russia could be using tried-and-tested tactics of labeling the oil as sourced from elsewhere, turning off tanker transponders, and even falsifying the positions of tankers via the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data to hide activity taking place hundreds of miles away from the false positioning data.\n\nBy using various spoofing tactics, producers and sellers of sanctioned oil still get to place their products with buyers who are happy to get heavily discounted crude.\n\nBut not all buyers, especially those in jurisdictions with strict controls and checks such as the U.S., are tempted to discard concerns and red flags about a cargos origin. Other buyers, especially independent Chinese refiners, are unfazed as their priority is to buy low-priced crude and make good profits refining it. China, the worlds top oil importer, continues to buy Iranian and Venezuelan crude, often masked as crude from Malaysia or Oman, various analysis and investigative reports have found over the past few years.\n\nOutside China, buyers are wary of coming under sanctions and generally look to avoid mysterious crudes of suspicious origin.\n\nOne such recent case was an offer to buyers in the Houston area, the heart of the U.S. Gulf Coast refining industry. Trader Jonathan Plemel of Sidewalks Holdings has recently offered heavy crude documented as coming from Mexico, which, however, was being offered at the massive discount of $30 per barrel to the U.S. benchmark. Potential buyers passed on the offer because, as cheap and alluring as it looked like, they were concerned about the origin, doubting it was really from Mexico, Bloomberg reported this week, citing Plemel and other traders in the Houston area who have been approached with similarly attractive offers in the past year.\n\nPlemel told Bloomberg he couldnt be certain of the origin of the crude and couldnt answer many questions from prospective buyers\n\n\"Could the oil potentially be from abandoned wells in Mexico? From Venezuela? I honestly cant say.\"\n\nVenezuela is using false documents and tankers linked to Iran and known for carrying sanctioned Iranian crude in the past, a recent investigation by Reuters showed. Venezuela is selling oil to Chinese refiners, passing it off as Malaysian crude in documents, the investigation showed.\n\nMalaysian waters are also notorious for ship-to-ship transfers and mixing of crude to hide the true origin of Iranian and Venezuelan oil. This year, Chinese customs data have at times shown so many imports from Malaysia that analysts and observers believe that China continues to import sanctioned oil passed off as coming from Oman or Malaysia.\n\nLast month, Chinas independent refiners imported record volumes of Iranian crude passed off as coming from Malaysia, Oman, or elsewhere, according to Vortexa tanker tracking data cited by Reuters.\n\nRussia will also increasingly resort to sanction-evading practices such as masking its crude or deceiving positioning data, analysts say. Russia has already amassed a \"shadow fleet\" of tankers to ship its crude outside the price cap, and is copying some of the techniques used by Iran and Venezuela, which are on the list of Moscows \"friendly\" countries.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTankers carrying Venezuelan crude have been found to falsify their positions over the past year, and this summer, a Russia-flagged tanker in the Mediterranean was caught falsifying its AIS, research by Global Fishing Watch and SkyTruth showed this week.\n\nThe investigation into the movements of the Russian tanker Kapitan Schemilkin showed that the vessel altered its signal to show falsely that it was circling offshore Greece, while in reality, the ship traveled to locations near Malta and Cyprus.\n\n\"It would prove to be the first detection ever of a Russian-flagged tanker broadcasting false coordinatesand it may be the first of many,\" SkyTruth said.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",

REUTERS/Tatiana Meel Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - When U.S. officials first floated the idea of capping Russian oil export prices in response to a planned European embargo in March, they pledged to squeeze revenues to Russia's war machine, while avoiding a devastating oil price spike.\n\nBut keeping Russian oil on the market and global prices low soon became the bigger priority as oil prices jumped, people familiar with the mechanism's evolution and energy analysts said.\n\nThe $60-per-barrel price limit on seaborne crude imposed by G7 democracies and Australia on Monday bears that out, lining up with current market prices.\n\nAnalysts said the cap will have little immediate impact on the oil revenues that Moscow is currently earning. Russia said on Monday the cap would not hurt the financing of its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\n\nThe price cap is \"an unhappy compromise that will do very little to cut Russia's oil revenue\" from current levels, said Ben Cahill, an energy security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\"I really think that the U.S. Treasury's main objective was to defuse the EU shipping, insurance and services bans that are part of the sanctions on Russian oil exports,\" Cahill said.\n\nRussia's Urals blend crude for delivery to Europe was quoted at an average price $55.97 on Tuesday, below the cap and down from $61.35 on Sunday.\n\nThe benchmark Brent crude price slid to its lowest since January on Tuesday at below $80, extending a downward trend as growing concerns about global demand offset any bullish effects from the price cap on Russian oil sales.\n\nOfficials at the U.S. Treasury, the driving force behind the G7 price cap, sought to evenly weigh reducing Russia's revenues and maintaining supply, though market pricing influenced this at times, a senior Treasury official told Reuters.\n\n\"There have been times when Brent has fluctuated an enormous amount over the past eight months, where we were worried about one over the other, but in general, we've created these to be the twin goals that have equal importance.\"\n\nThe official said the price cap is \"institutionalizing\" current market discounts, arguing that plans for the cap were responsible for oil price declines over the past several months.\n\nAnalysts also attribute the drop in global oil prices to a weakening global economy, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the OPEC+ group's decision to maintain steady production.\n\nReuters Graphics Reuters Graphics\n\nPRICES, RUSSIAN INCOME DECLINE\n\nAt the current price cap level, Russia would earn oil export revenues of about $10 billion to $15 billion a month, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York.\n\nThat is far lower than over $21 billion a month Moscow earned in June, according to an estimate from the International Energy Agency (IEA), as Brent topped $120.\n\nAt current oil price cap levels, Russia is earning about the same as it did before talk of a Ukraine invasion started driving prices up. Russia earned about $15 billion in June and July 2021, before Russian troop buildups near Ukraine.\n\nThe $60 price cap level was agreed on Friday after fierce debate. Poland, Lithuania and Estonia argued that European Union countries should make the cap as low as $30, closer to Russia's production cost, after an initial proposal of $65-70.\n\nFUTURE CASH FLOW\n\nAs crude prices have fallen, the language surrounding the price cap from U.S. officials has evolved from \"reducing\" Russia's revenues, to \"limiting\" future cash flow.\n\nU.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told the Reuters NEXT conference in New York on Thursday that the cap \"will lead to Russia earning less revenue going forward and having less money to invest in conducting the war.\"\n\n\"The key thing to remember is that we're starting at $60 but we have the ability to...further use the price cap to constrain Russia's revenues over time,\" Adeyemo said.\n\nIn July, Adeyemo said the goal was to eliminate the \"risk premium,\" or price increase that Russia had introduced into the\n\noil market with its invasion of Ukraine, to give Moscow less money to \"pay for their war machine.\"\n\nIf Moscow makes good on threats to curtail production rather than sell oil to countries observing the cap, prices could shoot higher, and that is where it could get tricky for the United States and G7 allies.\n\nU.S. officials \"want to avoid that at all costs,\" said Mizuho's Yawger, adding that this could mean that \"suddenly support for Ukraine starts to dry up.\"\n\nPRICE SPIKE AVOIDED\n\nOil markets have shifted significantly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 sent prices soaring.\n\nInternal Treasury estimates around that time had showed that global crude prices could exceed $150 with the EU embargo in place and no mitigating measures.\n\nAnd with the IEA predicting that oil markets could lose 3 million Russian barrels per day if the most stringent EU sanctions were imposed, Barclays and Rystad Energy warned that oil could hit $200.\n\nTreasury's \"true motivation after March has been primarily to preserve Russian flows in the face of EU sanctions, which they don't think were a good idea,\" said a source briefed on Biden administration discussions.\n\n\"They believed if there was an oil price spike, not only will it hurt us economically and politically, but it'll damage Western support for Ukraine,\" in its fight against Russia's military.\n\nAs the G7 formed the plan, India and China have snapped up heavily discounted Russian oil, and are expected to continue big purchases outside the price cap, moves endorsed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nReporting by David Lawder and Timothy Gardner; Additional reporting by Noah Browning in London; Editing by Heather Timmons, Marguerita Choy and Kim Coghill\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "As Prepared for Delivery\n\nGood afternoon, everyone.\n\nIt is my great pleasure to be here with all of you today to discuss the importance and implications of economic sanctions.\n\nAs you all know, in February of this year, Russia launched an unprovoked war in Europe. To this day, Russia has chosen violence and death. Moscow continues to launch missiles into Ukraineattacking the civilian power grid, which will cause electricity and heating blackouts in the middle of winter; damaging residential buildings hundreds of miles away from the border; and killing innocents. This kind of warfare is of course a direct attack on Ukraines people, a brutal attempt to sever their access to basic needs. It is also a naked attempt to put Ukraines economy in a deep freezeit is economic warfare.\n\nSecretary Yellen has called ending this invasion a \"moral imperative.\" She has noted rightly that it is a primary driver for global economic insecurity. Accordingly, the Treasury Department is using its financial authorities to achieve three objectives: (1) deprive Russia of the enabling means necessary to wage war in Ukraine; (2) prevent Russia from projecting military power; and (3) deter and denounce Russian war crimes and human rights abuses in Ukraine. To achieve these objectives, we have brought to bear both well-establish tools from our economic arsenal as well as bold, novel approaches that are pushing the boundaries of economic statecraft.\n\nYesterdays news represents the culmination of our efforts to pursue one such novel economic approach: the United States, alongside Australia, the G7 countries, and the EU put into effect a price cap on Russian-origin oil to reduce the Kremlins oil revenues.\n\nMany of you may have heard about this policy and may be responsible for ensuring your businesses are in compliance with it. I want to illustrate for you the \"why\" and the \"how\" of this policywhy we are doing it and how it will work.\n\nLets start with the why. Russia is a major energy exporter. This means that under any conditions, a significant share of Russias fiscal resources come from oil exports. More critically, though, Russias invasion of Ukraine created the uncertainty that drove the price of oil up from the pre-invasion average of $70 per barrel to a high of more than $140 per barrel post-invasion. As a result, Russia has reaped a windfall from elevated oil priceswhich has enabled it to fund brutal military operations and sustain its illegal and unjust war against Ukraine, all while the rest of the world bears the costs of higher energy prices.\n\nThe price cap policy is designed to limit Russias ability to profit from its aggression, while promoting global energy stability by keeping Russian oil on the market. This is accomplished by ensuring that companies within their respective jurisdictions provide services relating to the maritime transport of Russian oil purchased at or below the cap. Given that the G7 countries and the EU provide a significant portion of the maritime-related servicesincluding 90 percent of insurance and reinsurance, and significant financingthis will have a broad effect. Their services are reliable, and can be more affordable and available than the alternative, so remaining purchasers of Russian oil, including from emerging markets, are incentivized to significantly negotiate down Russian oil prices to be able to access these services.\n\nThere are alternatives for the Russians, of course. They could sell to those outside the price cap coalition using non-G7, EU, or Australian services. In this scenario, we expect that the purchasers not using coalition services would then use their own increased purchasing power to nevertheless negotiate discounts under current prices. In this scenario, the price cap would create a ceiling on Russian oil prices and revenues. And remember, these purchasersincluding countries like China and Indiahave every incentive to demand lower prices because it benefits them and their consumers. This policy was deliberately designed to incorporate their self-interest.\n\nThe Russians could potentially refuse to sell oil at or below the price cap, which would force them to shut in their oil, denying them revenue and potentially taxing and damaging their medium- to long-term drilling, refining, and storage infrastructure. In any event, we will continue pursuing our overarching policy goal: to cut into Russias energy revenues and to keep Russian oil flowing in a stable global market.\n\nWhile we assess that the market incentive for businesses to pay the lowest price possible will be the biggest motivation to comply with the price cap, we have layered a multifaceted policy structure on top, in the form of the services ban for oil purchased above the price cap, coupled with a safe harbor to provide assurances to U.S. service providers that comply in good faith with the policy. We will enforce the price cap policy by focusing enforcement on willful violatorssuch as taking action against those who attempt to defraud or mislead coalition businesses into unwittingly providing services for oil purchased above the cap.\n\nHowever, the price cap is just one aspect of our modernized economic toolkit targeting Russias war machine. We are also redoubling our efforts on investigations into Russian entities tied to the military-industrial complex, financial sector, Kremlin-linked oligarchs, and other focal points for corruption. To illustrate this point, I want to talk about Suleiman Kerimov.\n\nKerimov, an oligarch who is both a billionaire and a member of the Russian parliament, was first designated by the U.S. Treasury in 2018. He was part of a broader tranche of Russian persons that engaged in a range of illicit activity around the globe, benefiting and profiting from his connections to a corrupt Russian government. At the time of designation, Kerimov was also alleged to have laundered money through the purchases of real estate and illegally transported millions of euros into France without reporting it to the appropriate tax authorities.\n\nSince 2018, knowing that sanctioned billionaires do not sit idly by, we have continued to investigate Kerimov and his network, which led to two major actions this year.\n\nThe first was the blocking of Heritage Trust, a Delaware-based trust formed in 2017 in which Kerimov holds a property interest.\n\nAt the time of the blocking action this past June, the trust was valued at more than $1 billion. Let me emphasize that: 1 billion dollars of Russian oligarch money, sitting in a Delaware trust. Investigative efforts also found that Kerimov was not the only sanctioned person with an interest in Heritage Trust. His nephew, Ruslan Gadzhiyev, a member of the Russian Duma who was designated in March of this year, is a beneficiary of Heritage Trust.\n\nThis blocking action was made possible with extensive investigative work by OFACs Enforcement Division that employed a range of investigative tools. They saw that these funds entered the U.S. financial system through a complex and layered network of opaque legal entities located in Europe and in various well-known tax shelters. From there, the funds were invested in several large public and private U.S. companies.\n\nThis last leg is what I want to emphasize to this group today. Dirty Russian money can only come into the United States if there are U.S. persons, whether they are family members, banks, investment advisors, broker/dealers, or even venture capital firms, who facilitate its entry. We expect financial institutions and all covered institutions to proactively investigate and screen for these types of risks and report any suspicious activity to Treasury. As you know, OFAC may impose civil penalties for sanctions violations based on strict liabilityknowledge of prohibited dealings is not required. And while OFAC of course takes into account whether a subject was witting, Treasury will not hesitate to act where we see control failures or lapses in vigilance that enable evasion to occur.\n\nThe second action I want to specifically highlight is the investigatory work that led to exposing Kerimovs broader network of associates and facilitators.\n\nAs of September 2022, a number of our partners had also designated Kerimov, including Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice had also worked with its Fijian counterparts to seize a $300 million yacht assessed to be owned by Kerimov. The breadth of this group is a testament to the strength of our coalition and the unity of our opposition to Russias brutality.\n\nLast month, Treasury further exposed Kerimovs network by designating his family members, associates, and facilitators, including one who has allegedly laundered money on his behalf. This investigation ensnared entities in Russia, France, Switzerland, the UAE, Germany, Luxembourg, the British Virgin Islands, Malta, Cyprus, and Spain, and showed how Kerimovs complex facilitation network continued to move money years after his initial designation.\n\nOur objective here was to expose the breadth of Kerimovs financial facilitators and block any associated funds used to advance Russias war. We shared information with our international counterparts, assessed mitigation factors, publicly released as much identifiable information as we could, and relied on every relevant part of the Treasury team to execute the action. Just last week, France announced a renewed investigation of Kerimov and his assets following Treasurys designation.\n\nThe example set by the Kerimov case constitutes a wake-up call. It shows how extensive these facilitation networks are, and how they may continue to use U.S. or other non-Russian persons to maintain access to our formal financial networks even after designations are in place. Additionally, these actions are a reminder to both the designated Russian entities and their enablers, both foreign and domestic, that our investigations into their activity will persist.\n\nI want to close by emphasizing your critical role in defending our economic and financial systems. You all are keenly attuned to what is going on in the world and on the battlefield of Russias brutal war. You are on the financial front lines of this conflict, implementing the policy decisions made by our governments to take a stand against global atrocities.\n\nYou file the suspicious activity reports to give us and other authorities information on networks that you have uncovered shielding designated persons. You help let us know where the mega yachts and private jets are. You provide the building blocks of sanctions evasion typologies that go into our press releases and advisories. You notice and flag the indicators for trade-based money laundering on which we can take action.\n\nFor all these efforts, my colleagues and I are extremely grateful. But we cannot rest on our laurels. We need to redouble effortsto make sure that these networks do not pass under your radar and around our laws, and that when you obtain information about them, you promptly take action. This is not just a matter of compliance; it is a moral imperative. The choice is between permitting and preventing sanctions evasionthere is no space for neutral ground here.\n\nWhile I spent today focusing on Russia, it is certainly not the only challenge we face. Whether it is international wire fraud, proliferation financing, or money laundering through virtual asset services, Treasury and its tools will continue to be called upon to protect our financial system and expose those who would exploit it for illegal ends.\n\nFurther, Russias war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that we are not immune to challenges to the geopolitical stability we strive to maintain. We are constantly documenting and applying the lessons learned from this ongoing conflict to better prepare for the next challenge to the global order. This work is, frankly, daunting. However, I feel fortunate to be sharing this solemn responsibility with many outstanding colleagues in the private sector who are similarly committed to addressing these challenges. Thank you and I look forward to answering your questions.\n\n####",

No details were immediately available on what further actions could be taken.\n\nThe price cap, a G7 idea, aims to reduce Russia's income from selling oil, while preventing a spike in global oil prices after an EU embargo on Russian crude takes effect on Dec. 5.\n\nWarsaw had resisted the proposed level as it examined an adjustment mechanism to keep the cap below the market price. It had pushed in EU negotiations for the cap to be as low as possible to squeeze revenues to Russia and limit Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine.\n\nPolish Ambassador to the EU Andrzej Sados on Friday told reporters Poland had backed the EU deal, which included a mechanism to keep the oil price cap at least 5% below the market rate. U.S. officials said the deal was unprecedented and demonstrated the resolve of the coalition opposing Russia's war.\n\nA spokesperson for the Czech Republic, which holds the rotating EU presidency and oversees EU countries' negotiations, said it had launched the written procedure for all 27 EU countries to formally greenlight the deal, following Poland's approval.\n\nDetails of the deal are due to be published in the EU legal journal on Sunday.\n\nEU SEES SIGNIFICANT HIT TO RUSSIAN REVENUES\n\n[1/3]An aerial view shows the Vladimir Arsenyev tanker at the crude oil terminal Kozmino on the shore of Nakhodka Bay near the port city of Nakhodka, Russia August 12, 2022. REUTERS/Tatiana Meel Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the price cap would significantly reduce Russia's revenues.\n\n\"It will help us stabilise global energy prices, benefiting emerging economies around the world,\" von der Leyen said on Twitter, adding that the cap would be \"adjustable over time\" to react to market developments.\n\nThe G7 price cap will allow non-EU countries to continue importing seaborne Russian crude oil, but it will prohibit shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargoes of Russian crude around the globe, unless it is sold for less than the price cap.\n\nBecause the most important shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the price cap would make it very difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the cap will particularly benefit low- and medium-income countries that have borne the brunt of high energy and food prices.\n\n\"With Russias economy already contracting and its budget increasingly stretched thin, the price cap will immediately cut into Putins most important source of revenue,\" Yellen said in a statement.\n\nA senior U.S. Treasury Department official told reporters on Friday that the $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil will keep global markets well supplied while \"institutionalizing\" discounts created by the threat of such a limit.\n\nThe chair of the Russian lower house's foreign affairs committee told Tass news agency on Friday the European Union was jeopardising its own energy security.\n\nThe initial G7 proposal last week was for a price cap of $65-$70 per barrel with no adjustment mechanism. Since Russian Urals crude already traded lower, Poland, Lithuania and Estonia pushed for a lower price.\n\nRussian Urals crude traded at around $67 a barrel on Friday.\n\nEU countries have wrangled for days over the details, with those countries adding conditions to the deal - including that the price cap will be reviewed in mid-January and every two months after that, according to diplomats and an EU document seen by Reuters on Thursday.\n\nThe document also said a 45-day transitional period would apply to vessels carrying Russian crude that was loaded before Dec. 5 and unloaded at its final destination by Jan. 19, 2023.\n\nReporting by Jan Strupczewski and Kate Abnett in Brussels and David Lawder, Andrea Shalal and Daphne Psaledakis in Washington; editing by Geert De Clercq, Philippa Fletcher, Barbara Lewis, Alistair Bell and Daniel Wallis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Cushing is also the delivery point for the WTI crude futures contract.\n\nKeystone has remained shut since a 14,000-barrel leak in the US state of Kansas reported on Dec. 7. TC Energy has not released a timeline for a restart of the line, which carries crude to refineries in the Midwest and Gulf Coast.\n\nLibyan oil production at 1.2 million barrels per day: Minister\n\nLibya is producing about 1.2 million barrels per day of oil, Oil Minister Mohamed Oun told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting organized by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\n\"We hope to return to 2010 levels, which was 1.6 million bpd, within two or three years,\" he added.\n\nHe added that he hoped that Libyas decision to lift force majeure on oil and gas exploration, which was announced last week, would encourage foreign oil companies to return to the country.\n\nMeanwhile, figures from Nigerias petroleum regulator suggested that the countrys oil production rose to 1.185 million bpd in November from 1.014 million barrels in October.\n\nTimipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, said Nigeria is working to meet its oil production quota decided by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, of 1.8 million bpd by the end of May next year.\n\nEuropes gas market faces risks from EU price cap: Official\n\nA European Commission plan for a gas price cap risks reducing liquidity in Europes gas market, posing a threat to how it functions, the head of trading at Norwegian oil company Equinor told Reuters, but its own gas deliveries will not be affected.\n\nThe aim of the cap is to shield European consumers from the surge in energy prices they have faced since Russia invaded Ukraine, and which has helped to fuel inflation.\n\nFor Equinor, the biggest concern is what happens to the liquidity in the gas market, Helge Haugane, Equinors head of gas and power trading, said in an interview.\n\nHaugane has previously raised the alarm on market liquidity. In September, he warned that some 1.5 trillion euros ($1.58 trillion) tied up in the margin calls that traders pay to protect against defaults could squeeze gas and power market liquidity and see smaller market participants struggling.\n\nBut he said this was no longer a \"big issue,\" with margin calls now only \"a fraction\" of what they were at the end of August.\n\n\"I think the price cap is the one that we need to pay attention to,\" Haugane said.\n\n\"From the Equinor perspective, we should still be able to get our gas to the markets and we should get the gas to the markets where its needed the most,\" Haugane said of the Commissions proposal.\n\n(With input from Reuters)",

In an obvious reaction, Russia rejected the oil price ceiling and warned the West of retaliation.\n\nFollowing the imposition of the price cap, G7, and European Union-based insurance and reinsurance companies that provide services for tankers carrying Russian crude oil, as well as institutions financing Russian crude transactions, will not be allowed to handle such cargoes unless the oil is bought at or below the price cap. Shipping companies will not be allowed to provide tankers for the transport of Russian crude as well unless the oil is sold at or below the $60 price cap.\n\nThe price cap came into effect from the 5th of December, aimed at reducing Russian revenue as it looks to finance its war against Ukraine.\n\nImpact of the price cap on India\n\nIndia has emerged as the second biggest importer of Russian crude after China in the post-Ukraine war world. Indias imports from the Middle East fell 16.2% to about 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, while imports from Russia increased 4.6% to about 896,000 bpd. In October, Russias share of Indias imports increased to 4.24 million tonnes, or nearly 1 million barrels per day, giving it a 21% share, comparable to Iraqs and higher than Saudi Arabias share of around 15%. In November, India bought 40% of the Russian Urals seaborne export volume.\n\nSince Indian refiners are already getting Russian crude at $60 a barrel or below, there will hardly be a negative impact of the price cap on India.\n\nAs India has reiterated that it will continue to purchase oil from Russia with Moscow assuring that it will directly negotiate with its crude buyers, the price cap is likely to benefit India. The price cap would furnish them with leverage to further reduce the price paid to Russia.\n\nHardeep Singh Puri, Indias Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, has said that the oil price cap will not have an impact on India. He mentioned that Indias oil import from Russia is very limited and that India now sources oil from 39 countries including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and also exploring trade possibilities in Africa. Other than this, India may also buy more oil from the United States, Guyana, and other countries in the future.\n\nMinister Puri also said that the global oil producers have assured India that there will be no disruption in oil supplies. India will turn the global oil challenges into an opportunity to secure affordable energy, the Minister said.\n\nSpeaking in Rajya Sabha on December 7, the External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar said that Indian refiners look for the best deal they can find and that the Indian government does not direct them particularly to buy Russian oil. On the impact of the price cap on India, he said that it is not very clear yet.\n\nWe dont ask our companies to buy Russian oil, we ask them to buy whats the best option they get. It depends on the market, its a sensible policy to go where we get the best deal in the interest of the Indian people: EAM S Jaishankar pic.twitter.com/RDiJNOfNYy ANI (@ANI) December 7, 2022\n\nJaishankar reiterated in the Parliament that India has always urged both Ukraine and Russia to resolve disputes through dialogue and return to diplomacy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also told in strong words to the Russian President Putin that \"this is not an era of war.\"\n\nEU and G7 impose a price cap on Russian oil\n\nLast week, European Union and the G7 countries imposed a price cap on Russian oil.\n\nPresident of the European Union, Ursula von Der Leyen, in a video message she posted on Twitter, highlighted that the oil price cap will \"reduce Russias revenues significantly and stabilise global energy prices.\"\n\nThe EU agreement on an oil price cap, coordinated with G7 and others, will reduce Russias revenues significantly.\n\nIt will help us stabilise global energy prices, benefitting emerging economies around the world. pic.twitter.com/3WmIalIe5y Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) December 2, 2022\n\nRegarding the objectives of the oil price cap, the European Commission president stated that it will first solidify the effect of EUs sanctions, secondly, it will reduce Russias revenues, and thirdly, it will stabilise global energy markets by allowing some Russian seaborne oil to be traded, brokered, and transported by EU operators to third countries as long as it is sold below the cap.\n\nFrom December 5 onwards, Western shipping and insurance firms are not permitted to handle Russian oil sold above the price cap.\n\nRussian Response\n\nReacting to the newly imposed oil price cap, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the cap will have a limited impact on Russia and called it a \"stupid, ill-conceived and miscalculated proposal and a harmful decision for the global energy markets.\"\n\nPresident #Putin: The cap on Russian #oil will not harm us in any way. It is a stupid, ill-conceived & uncalculated proposal and a harmful decision for world #energy markets. pic.twitter.com/pGmorYejaI Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) December 10, 2022\n\nEarlier, President Putin while speaking to the media hinted at cutting oil production. \"I am not saying that it is a decision, however, if necessary, we will think about production cuts,\" Putin said on state-run Rossiya 24 TV.\n\nOther than production cuts, Russia may soon withhold its oil supplies to countries backing the price cap. Besides, Russia may set maximum discounts to international benchmarks or may decide a fixed price per barrel for selling its crude.\n\nIn order to avert the sanctions levied by the west, Russia has been selling its crude to countries like India and China at discounted rates. Russia has volumes committed to multiple buyers at a 40-50% discount.\n\nRussia welcomes Indias move not to back G7s price cap\n\nIn his meeting with the Indian Ambassador to Russia, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak welcomed Indias decision not to back the price cap imposed on December 5 on Russian oil by the G7 and its allies.\n\nAs per the statement issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry, Indias imports of Russian oil surged to Rs 16.35 million tonnes till August 2022.\n\nThe Russian Deputy Prime Minister also offered India assistance in building large-capacity ships in order to avoid reliance on insurance and tanker chartering bans in the EU and the United Kingdom.\n\nWith India exploring various options to meet its energy demand and dealing with Russia for seamless crude supply and a balanced foreign policy, the impact of the G7 and EU-imposed oil price cap is unlikely to be negative.",

West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell 3.48%, to $74.26 after hitting its lowest level this year.\n\n\"In this market, the sentiment is more negative,\" said Eli Tesfaye, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. \"We could be looking at $60-a-barrel WTI the way that things are going. I think $80s are going to be the new high, and I would be very surprised to see any higher than that.\"\n\nService-sector activity in China has hit a six-month low, and European economies have slowed due to the high cost of energy and rising interest rates.\n\nIf current declines hold, Brent crude will post its biggest single-day slump since late September.\n\nBoth Brent and WTI futures on Monday recorded their largest daily drop in two weeks after U.S. services industry data indicated a strong U.S. economy and drove expectations of higher interest rates than previously forecast.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index edged lower on Tuesday but was still buoyed by bets on higher interest rates, following the biggest rally in two weeks on Monday.\n\nA stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for buyers holding other currencies, reducing demand.\n\nIn China, more cities are easing COVID-19-related curbs, prompting expectations of increased demand in the world's top oil importer, although that has not been enough to rally futures.\n\nU.S. crude oil stocks are forecast to have fallen last week. The American Petroleum Institute's weekly report is due later on Tuesday, followed by government data on Wednesday.\n\n\"Oil markets will likely stay volatile in the near term, driven by COVID headlines in China and central bank policies in the U.S. and Europe,\" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.\n\nThe market was also weighing the production impact of a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian crude imposed by Group of Seven (G7) nations, the European Union and Australia. So far there is a \"lack of an impact on Russian flows\", said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler.\n\n\"Russian seaborne exports and production are just not dropping. Along with fears of further rate hikes - crude is getting swept up in the risk-off tilt of broader markets,\" Smith said.\n\nRussia has said it will not sell oil to anyone who signs up to the price cap. Russia's January-November oil and gas condensate production rose 2.2% from a year ago to 488 million tonnes, according to Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who expects a slight output decline following the latest sanctions.",

                "cc_text": "Even at $60 Oil, These Energy Stocks Are Still Ridiculously Cheap\n\nProminent oil buyers across the world have collectively decided to cap the price of oil exported from Russia. Last week, members of the G7 and European Union bloc of nations decided to implement a US$60 price cap on crude oil exported from Russia.\n\nWill this new cap have any impact? What does it mean for Canadian oil stocks? Heres a closer look.\n\nOil price cap\n\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude currently trades at U.S.$74. However, crude exported from Russia (Ural) is much cheaper, currently trading at US$62. Thats because most G7 and E.U. nations already have a ban on Russian crude. That has compelled the country to sell its resources to China and India at a discount.\n\nThe new price cap isnt much lower than the current price of Russian crude. However, it does prevent oil tankers from getting insurance on their vessels if they accept Russian crude at higher prices. U.S. and European financial institutions dominate over 90% of this insurance market.\n\nThe price cap also gives Russias biggest customers India and China an excuse to pay less. So, the cap could have some impact.\n\nNevertheless, the global energy market is still supply constrained. Crude oil could be expensive for the foreseeable future. And Canadian oil stocks are still relatively cheap.\n\nCanadian oil stocks\n\nEric Nuttall, a partner and senior portfolio manager at Ninepoint Partners, calculated the profitability of Canadian oil producers under the assumption that a barrel of WTI would settle at US$70. Based on his analysis, the average Canadian oil stock generates a free cash flow yield of roughly 19% at these prices.\n\nIn other words, Canadian oil companies are immensely profitable and undervalued, even if oil isnt trading at a record high.\n\nSmaller producers such as Tamarack Valley Energy (TSX:TVE) and Baytex Energy (TSX:BTE) are cheaper than their peers. Tamarack Valley produces a free cash flow yield of roughly 23% if WTI is at US$70. Baytex, meanwhile, generates a yield of 19% at similar levels.\n\nBoth stocks have outperformed the TSX Index this year. Tamarack is up 16.4% year to date, while Baytex is up 56.7% over the same period. This outperformance could continue in 2023.\n\nOf course, this is the base-case scenario. These oil stocks are undervalued and lucrative at current levels. The price of oil could surge higher if global supply is disrupted or another geopolitical issue emerges. It could also decline if the upcoming recession is more severe than we expect.\n\nInvestors need to carefully consider both these scenarios before investing in Canadas energy sector.\n\nBottom line\n\nOil prices have declined in recent months. The G7 and E.U.s new price cap on Russian crude could have a small impact, too. However, Canadian oil stocks have already priced in these factors. Theyre arguably undervalued. If youre seeking passive income or a contrarian bet on global energy, take a closer look at this sector.",

                "cc_text": "This piece is part of a series of policy analyses entitled \" The Talbott Papers on Implications of Russias Invasion of Ukraine ,\" named in honor of American statesman and former Brookings Institution President Strobe Talbott. Brookings is grateful to Trustee Phil Knight for his generous support of the Brookings Foreign Policy program.\n\nNine months into Russias latest invasion of Ukraine, the outcome of the war remains unclear. The Russian military appears incapable of taking Kyiv or occupying a major portion of the country. Ukrainian forces have enjoyed three months of success on the battlefield and could well continue to make progress in regaining territory. The war also could settle into a more drawn-out conflict, with neither side capable of making a decisive breakthrough in the near term.\n\nIn September, the Ukrainian army launched two counteroffensives. One in the northeast expelled Russian forces from Kharkiv oblast and pressed assaults into Luhansk oblast. In the south, the second counteroffensive succeeded in November in driving Russian forces out of Kherson city and the neighboring region, the only area that Russian forces occupied east of the Dnipro River, which roughly bisects Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian army gained ground in southern Ukraine, but it failed to take Kyiv. By late March, Russian forces were in retreat in the north. Moscow proclaimed its new objective as occupying all of Donbas, consisting of the oblasts (regions) of Luhansk and Donetsk, some 35% of which had already been occupied by Russian and Russian proxy forces in 2014 and 2015. After three months of grinding battle, Russian forces captured almost all of Luhansk, but they made little progress in Donetsk, and the battlelines appeared to stabilize in August.\n\nThis latest phase in hostilities between Russia and Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, when Russian President Vladimir Putin directed his forces to launch a major, multi-prong invasion of Ukraine. The broad scope of the assault, which Putin termed a \"special military operation,\" suggested that Moscows objectives were to quickly seize Kyiv, presumably deposing the government, and occupy as much as the eastern half to two-thirds of the country.\n\nProjecting the ultimate outcome of the war is challenging. However, some major ramifications for Russia and its relations with Ukraine, Europe, and the United States have come into focus. While the war has been a tragedy for Ukraine and Ukrainians, it has also proven a disaster for Russia militarily, economically, and geopolitically. The war has badly damaged Russias military and tarnished its reputation, disrupted the economy, and profoundly altered the geopolitical picture facing Moscow in Europe. It will make any near-term restoration of a degree of normalcy in U.S.-Russian relations difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.\n\nPoor leadership, poor tactics, poor logistics, and underwhelming performance against a smaller and less well-armed foe have left Russias military reputation in a shambles. That will have an impact. Over the past decade, Russian weapons exporters saw their share of global arms exports drop by 26%. Countries looking to buy weapons likely will begin to turn elsewhere, given that Russias military failed to dominate early in the war, when its largely modernized forces faced a Ukrainian military armed mainly with aging Soviet-era equipment (that began to change only in the summer, when stocks of heavy weapons began arriving from the West).\n\nAs a result of these losses, Russia has had to draw on reserves, including T-64 tanks first produced nearly 50 years ago. It reportedly has turned to tanks from Belarus to replenish its losses. To augment its own munitions, Russia has had to purchase attack drones from Iran and artillery shells from North Korea . As the Russian military has drawn down stocks of surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missiles, it has used S-300 anti-aircraft missiles against ground targets. The Russian defense budget will need years to replace what the military has lost or otherwise expended in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian military has lost significant amounts of equipment. The Oryx website reports 8,000 pieces of equipment destroyed, damaged, abandoned, or captured, including some 1,500 tanks, 700 armored fighting vehicles, and 1,700 infantry fighting vehicles. Oryx advises that its numbers significantly understate the true nature of Russian losses, as it counts only equipment for which it has unique photo or videographic evidence of its fate. Others report much heavier losses. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin commented that the Russian military had lost \"staggering\" numbers of tanks and other armored vehicles, adding that Western trade restrictions on microchips would inhibit production of replacements.\n\nIn November, Milley put the number of dead and wounded Russian soldiers at 100,000, and that could fall on the low side. A Pentagon official said in early August Russian casualties numbered 70,000-80,000. That was more than three months ago, and those months have shown no kindness to the Russian army. Reports suggest that newly-mobilized and ill-trained Russian units have been decimated in combat.\n\nWhile a tragedy for Ukraine, Putins decision to go to war has also proven a disaster for Russia. The Russian military has suffered significant personnel and military losses. Economic sanctions imposed by the EU, United States, United Kingdom, and other Western countries have pushed the Russian economy into recession and threaten longer-term impacts, including on the countrys critical energy sector.\n\nThe Kremlin has sought since the end of the Soviet Union to keep Ukraine bound in a Russian sphere of influence. From that perspective, the last nine years of Russian policy have been an abysmal failure. Nothing has done more than that policy to push Ukraine away from Russia and toward the West, or to promote Ukrainian hostility toward Russia and Russians.\n\nAs for NATO, 10 alliance members have expressed support for a membership path for Ukraine, nine in central Europe plus Canada . Other allies have generally remained silent or noncommittal, reflecting the fact that many, while prepared to provide Ukraine financial and military assistance, are not prepared to go to war with Russia to defend Ukraine. Even though Kyiv cannot expect membership or a membership action plan any time soon, it will have continued NATO support in its fight against Russia and, once the war is over, help in building a modern and robust military to deter a Russian attack in the future.\n\nIronically for an invasion launched in part due to Kremlin concern that Ukraine was moving away from Russia and toward the West, the war has opened a previously closed path for Ukraines membership in the European Union (EU). For years, EU officials concluded agreements with Kyiv, including the 2014 EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. However, EU officials avoided language that would give Ukraine a membership perspective. In June, four months after Russias invasion, the European Council recognized Ukraines European perspective and gave it the status of candidate country. Kyiv will need years to meet the EUs standards, but it now has a membership perspective that it lacked for the first 30 years of its post-Soviet independence.\n\nIt will take years, if not decades, to overcome the enmity toward Russia and Russians engendered by the war. One Ukrainian journalist predicted last summer that, after the wars end, Ukraine would witness a nationwide effort to \"cancel\" Russian culture, e.g., towns and cities across the country would rename their Pushkin Squares. It has already begun; Odesa intends to dismantle its statue of Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in 1794.\n\nUkrainians have made clear their resolve to resist. A September Gallup poll reported 70% of Ukrainians determined to fight until victory over Russia. A mid-October Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll had 86% supporting the war and opposing negotiations with Russia, despite Russian missile attacks against Ukrainian cities.\n\nAll this has understandably affected Ukrainian attitudes. It has deepened the sense of Ukrainian national identity. An August poll showed 85% self-identifying as Ukrainian citizens as opposed to people of some region or ethnic minority; only 64% did so six months earlier before Russias invasion. The invasion has also imbued Ukrainians with a strongly negative view of Russia: The poll showed 92% holding a \"bad\" attitude regarding Russia as opposed to only 2% with a \"good\" attitude.\n\nBesides the human losses, the war has caused immense material damage. Estimates of the costs of rebuilding Ukraine run from $349 billion to $750 billion, and those appraisals date back to the summer. Finding those funds will not be easy, particularly as the war has resulted in a significant contraction of the Ukrainian economy; the World Bank expects the countrys gross domestic product to shrink by 35% this year.\n\nIn addition, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees placed the number of Ukrainians who have sought refuge outside of Ukraine at more than 7.8 million as of November 8. As of mid-November, the Russian attacks had caused an estimated 6.5 million more to become internally displaced persons within Ukraine.\n\nPutins war has been calamitous for Ukraine. The precise number of military and civilians casualties is unknown but substantial. The Office of the U.N. Commissioner for Human Rights estimated that, as of the end of October, some 6,500 Ukrainian civilians had been killed and another 10,000 injured. Those numbers almost certainly understate the reality. U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley on November 10 put the number of civilian dead at 40,000 and indicated that some 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed or wounded (Milley gave a similar number for Russian casualties, a topic addressed later in this paper).\n\nOf all the pieces of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union that Moscow lost when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, no part meant more to Russians than Ukraine. The two countries histories, cultures, languages, and religions were closely intertwined. When the author served at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv at the end of the 1990s, most Ukrainians held either a positive or ambivalent view regarding Russia. That has changed. Today, most Ukrainians regard Russia as an enemy.\n\nWhether the Ukrainian military can drive the Russians completely out or at least back to the lines as of February 23 is also unclear. Some military experts believe this is possible, including the full liberation of Donbas and Crimea. Others offer less optimistic projections. The U.S. intelligence community has forecast that the fighting could drag on and become a war of attrition.\n\nAfter nine months of fighting, the Russian military has shown itself incapable of seizing and holding a large part of Ukraine. While the wars outcome is uncertain, however the conflict ends, a sovereign and independent Ukrainian state will remain on the map of Europe. Moreover, it will be larger than the rump state that the Kremlin envisaged when it launched the February invasion.\n\nAs of late November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his government insisted on conditions that included Russian withdrawal from all Ukrainian territory (including Crimea and all of Donbas), compensation, and punishment for war crimes. While these are understandable demands given what Ukraine has gone through, achieving them would prove difficult. Still, Kyiv appeared confident that it could liberate more territory even as winter approached.\n\nDespite three months of battlefield setbacks, Moscow has shown no indication of readiness to negotiate seriously to end the war. Indeed, on September 30, Putin announced that Russia was annexing Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, even though Russian forces did not fully control that territory and consistently lost ground there in the following weeks. The Russian military made up for battlefield losses by increasing missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, aimed in particular at disrupting electric power and central heating.\n\nAs Russia went to war, its economy was largely stagnant; while it recorded a post-COVID-19 boost in 2021, average real income fell by 10% between 2013 and 2020. It will get worse. The West has applied a host of economic sanctions on the country. While the Russian Central Banks actions have mitigated the worst impacts, the Russian economy nevertheless contracted by 5% year-on-year compared to September 2021. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development expects Russias economy to contract by 3.9% in 2022 and 5.6% in 2023, and a confidential study supposedly done for the Kremlin projected an \"inertial\" case in which the economy bottomed out only in 2023 at 8.3% below 2021. One economist notes that the Wests cut-off of chips and microelectronics has devastated automobile, aircraft, and weapons production, with the output of cars falling by 90% between March and September; he expects a long run of stagnation.\n\nIn addition to coping with the loss of high-tech and other key imports, the Russian economy faces brain drain, particularly in the IT sector, that began in February as well as the departure of more than 1,000 Western companies. It also has a broader labor force challenge. The military has mobilized 300,000 men, and the September mobilization order prompted a new flood of Russians leaving the country, with more than 200,000 going to Kazakhstan. Some estimates suggest several hundred thousand others have fled to other countries. Taken together, that means something like three-quarters of a million men unavailable to work in the economy.\n\nRussia thus far has staved off harsher economic difficulties in part because of its oil and gas exports and high energy prices. High prices have partially offset the decline in volume of oil and gas exports. That may soon change, at least for oil. The EU banned the purchase of Russian crude oil beginning on December 5, and the West is prohibiting shipping Russian oil on Western-flagged tankers or insuring tankers that move Russian oil if the oil is sold above a certain price, now set at $60 per barrel. The price cap if it works as planned could cut sharply into the revenues that Russian oil exports generate. The cap will require that Russian exporters discount the price of oil that they sell; the higher the discount, the less revenue that will flow to Russia.\n\nWeaning Europe off of Russian gas poses a more difficult challenge, but EU countries have made progress by switching to imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Moreover, European companies have found ways to cut energy use; for example, 75% of German firms that use gas report that they have reduced gas consumption without having to cut production. EU countries face a much better energy picture this winter than anticipated several months ago. If Europe successfully ends its import of Russian piped natural gas, that will pose a major problem for Gazprom, Russias large gas exporter. Gazproms gas exports move largely by pipeline, and Gazproms gas pipeline structure is oriented primarily toward moving gas from the western Siberian and Yamal gas fields to Europe. New pipelines would be needed to switch the flow of that gas to Asia. If Europe can kick the Russian gas habit, Gazprom will see a significant decline in its export volumes, unless it can build new pipelines to Asian markets and/or greatly expand its LNG export capacity, all of which will be expensive.\n\nA further problem facing Russias energy sector is that, as existing oil and gas fields are depleted, Russian energy companies must develop new fields to sustain production levels. Many of the potential new fields are in the Arctic region or off-shore and will require billions likely, tens of billions of dollars of investment. Russian energy companies, however, will not be able to count on Western energy companies for technical expertise, technology, or capital. That will hinder future production of oil and gas, as current fields become exhausted.\n\nAnother potential economic cost looms. The West has frozen more than $300 billion in Russian Central Bank reserves. As damages in Ukraine mount, pressure will grow to seize some or all of these assets for a Ukraine reconstruction fund. Western governments thus far show little enthusiasm for the idea. That said, it is difficult to see how they could turn to their taxpayers for money to assist Ukraines rebuilding while leaving the Russian Central Bank funds intact and/or releasing those funds back to Russia.\n\nWestern sanctions did not produce the quick crash in the ruble or the broader Russian economy that some expected. However, their impact could mean a stagnant economy in the longer term, and they threaten to cause particular problems in the energy sector and other sectors that depend on high-tech inputs imported from the West. Moscow does not appear to have handy answers to these problems.\n\nChanged geopolitics in Europe\n\nIn 2021, Moscow saw a West that was divided and preoccupied with domestic politics. The United States was recovering from four years of the Trump presidency, post-Brexit politics in Britain remained tumultuous, Germany faced September elections to choose the first chancellor in 16 years not named Angela Merkel, and France had a presidential election in early 2022. That likely affected Putins decision to launch his February invasion. In the event, NATO and the EU responded quickly and in a unified manner, and the invasion has prompted a dramatic reordering of the geopolitical scene in Europe. European countries have come to see Russia in a threatening light, reminiscent of how they viewed the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. NATOs June 2022 summit statement was all about deterrence and defense with regard to Russia, with none of earlier summits language on areas of cooperation.\n\nFew things epitomize the change more than the Zeitenwende (turning-point) in German policy. In the days following the Russian invasion, Berlin agreed to sanctions on Russian banks that few expected the Germans to approve, reversed a long-standing ban on exporting weapons to conflict zones in order to provide arms to Ukraine, established a 100-billion-euro ($110 billion) fund for its own rearmament, and announced the purchase of American dual-capable F-35 fighters to sustain the German Air Forces nuclear delivery role. Just days before the assault, the German government said it would stop certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Berlins follow-up has been bumpy and, at times, seemingly half-hearted, which has frustrated many of its partners. Still, in a few short weeks in late February and early March, German Chancellor Olaf Scholzs coalition government erased five decades of German engagement with Moscow.\n\nOther NATO members have also accelerated their defense spending. According to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, European allies and Canada have boosted defense spending by a total of $350 billion compared to levels in 2014, when the alliance following Russias seizure of Crimea set the goal for each member of 2% of gross domestic product devoted to defense by 2024. Stoltenberg added that nine members had met the 2% goal while 10 others intended to do so by 2024. Poland plans to raise its defense spending to 3% next year, and other allies have suggested the 3% target as well.\n\nMoscow did not like the small multinational battlegroups that NATO deployed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland beginning in 2017. Each numbered some 1,000-1,500 troops (battalion-sized) and were described as \"tripwire\" forces. Since February, NATO has deployed additional battlegroups in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Slovakia and decided on a more robust forward presence, including brigade-sized units, while improving capabilities for reinforcement. The U.S. military presence in Europe and European waters has grown from 80,000 service personnel to 100,000 and includes deployment of two F-35 squadrons to Britain, more destroyers to be homeported in Spain, and a permanent headquarters unit in Poland.\n\nIn addition to larger troop deployments, the Baltic Sea has seen a geopolitical earthquake. Finland and Sweden, which long pursued policies of neutrality, applied to join NATO in May and completed accession protocols in July. They have significant military capabilities. Their accession to the alliance, expected in early 2023, will make the Baltic Sea effectively a NATO lake, leaving Russia with just limited access from the end of the Gulf of Finland and its Kaliningrad exclave.\n\nIn early 2014, NATO deployed virtually no ground combat forces in countries that had joined the alliance after 1997. That began changing after Russias seizure of Crimea. The recent invasion has further energized NATO and resulted in its enlargement by two additional members. As Russia has drawn down forces opposite NATO countries (and Finland) in order to deploy them to Ukraine, the NATO military presence on Russias western flank has increased.\n\nThe Kremlin has waged a two-front war this year, fighting on the battlefield against Ukraine while seeking to undermine Western financial and military support for Kyiv. The Russians are losing on both fronts.\n\nThe Kremlin has waged a two-front war this year, fighting on the battlefield against Ukraine while seeking to undermine Western financial and military support for Kyiv. The Russians are losing on both fronts. The Russian military has been losing ground to the Ukrainian army and has carried out a campaign of missile strikes against power, heat, and water utilities in the country, which threatens a humanitarian crisis. Much will depend on how bad the winter is, but Ukrainians have shown remarkable resilience in restoring utilities, and the Russian attacks could further harden their resolve. Moreover, the brutality of the Russian missile campaign has already led Ukraines Western supporters to provide Kyiv more sophisticated air defenses, and pressures could grow to provide other weapons as well.\n\nAs for the second front, despite high energy prices, having to house the majority of the nearly eight million Ukrainians who have left their country, and concerns over how long the fighting might last, European support for Ukraine has not slackened. Russian hints of nuclear escalation caused concern but did not weaken European support for Ukraine, and Moscow has markedly deescalated the nuclear rhetoric in recent weeks. Given Russias relationship with China, the Kremlin certainly noticed Chinese President Xi Jinpings recent criticism of nuclear threats.\n\nIt appears Moscows influence elsewhere is slipping, including among post-Soviet states. Kazakhstan has boosted its defense spending by more than 50%. In June, on a stage with Putin in St. Petersburg, its president pointedly declined to follow Russias lead in recognizing the so-called Luhansk and Donetsk \"peoples republics\" as independent states. Neither Kazakhstan nor any other member of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) or any other post-Soviet state, for that matter has recognized Russias claimed annexations of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. In a remarkable scene at an October Russia-Central Asia summit, Tajikistans President Emomali Rahmon openly challenged Putin for his lack of respect for Central Asian countries. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan spoiled a late November CSTO summit; he refused to sign a leaders declaration and noticeably moved away from Putin during the summit photo op.\n\nMore broadly, in October, the U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution calling for rejection and demanding reversal of Moscows illegal annexation of the Ukrainian oblasts by a vote of 143-5 (35 abstaining). A recent article documented how Russia has found its candidates rejected and its participation suspended in a string of U.N. organizations, including the International Telecommunications Union, Human Rights Council, Economic and Social Council, and International Civil Aviation Organization. Putin chose not to attend the November G-20 summit in Bali, likely reflecting his expectation that other leaders would have snubbed him and refused to meet bilaterally, as well as the criticism he would have encountered in multilateral sessions. The summit produced a leaders declaration that, while noting \"other views,\" leveled a harsh critique at Moscow for its war on Ukraine.\n\nA deep freeze with Washington\n\nWhile U.S.-Russian relations had fallen to a post-Cold War low point in 2020, the June 2021 summit that U.S. President Joe Biden held with Putin gave a modest positive impulse to the relationship. U.S. and Russian officials that fall broadened bilateral diplomatic contacts and gave a positive assessment to the strategic stability dialogue, terming the exchanges \"intensive and substantive.\" Moreover, Washington saw a possible drop-off in malicious cyber activity originating from Russia. However, the Russian invasion prompted a deep freeze in the relationship, and Washington made clear that business as usual was off the table.\n\nU.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, and CIA Director Bill Burns nevertheless have kept channels open to their Russian counterparts. These lines of communication seek to avoid miscalculation particularly miscalculation that could lead to a direct U.S.-Russia or NATO-Russia clash and reduce risk. But other channels remain largely unused. Burnss November 14 meeting with Sergey Naryshkin, head of the Russian external intelligence service, was the most senior face-to-face meeting between U.S. and Russian officials in nine months. Biden and Putin have not spoken directly with one another since February, and that relationship seems irretrievably broken.\n\nIn a positive glimmer, Biden told the U.N. General Assembly \"No matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures.\" Speaking in June, the Kremlin spokesperson said \"we are interested [in such talks] Such talks are necessary.\" U.S. officials have privately indicated that, while they have prerequisites for resuming the strategic dialogue, progress on ending the Russia-Ukraine war is not one of them. This leaves room for some hope that, despite their current adversarial relationship, Washington and Moscow may still share an interest in containing their competition in nuclear arms.\n\nBeyond that, however, it is difficult to see much prospect for movement toward a degree of normalcy in the broader U.S.-Russia relationship. With Moscow turning to Iran and North Korea for weapons, Washington cannot count on Russian help in trying to bring Tehran back into the nuclear deal (the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) or to increase pressure on North Korea to end its missile launches and not to conduct another nuclear test. Likewise, coordination on Syria is less likely. It may well be that any meaningful improvement in the overall bilateral relationship requires Putins departure from the Kremlin. A second requirement could be that Putins successor adopt policy changes to demonstrate that Russia is altering course and prepared to live in peace with its neighbors.\n\nWhat happens will depend on how the Russian elite and public view his performance; while some signs of disaffection over the war have emerged, it is too early to forecast their meaning for Putins political longevity.\n\nThis does not mean to advocate a policy of regime change in Russia. That is beyond U.S. capabilities, especially given the opacity of todays Kremlin. U.S. policy should remain one of seeking a change in policy, not regime. That said, the prospects for improving U.S.-Russian relations appear slim while Putin remains in charge. What happens will depend on how the Russian elite and public view his performance; while some signs of disaffection over the war have emerged, it is too early to forecast their meaning for Putins political longevity.\n\nStill, while it remains difficult to predict the outcome of the war or the impact it may have on Putins time in the Kremlin, there is little doubt that the fighting with Ukraine and its ramifications will leave Russia diminished in significant ways. It must contend with a badly-damaged military that will take years to reconstitute; years of likely economic stagnation cut off from key high-tech imports; a potentially worsening situation with regard to energy exports and future production; an alarmed, alienated, and rearming Europe; and a growing political isolation that will leave Moscow even more dependent on its relationship with China. Putin still seems to cling to his desire of \"regaining\" part of Ukraine, which he considers \"historic Russian land.\" But the costs of that for Russia mount by the day.",

These include carbon capture projects at its Minnedosa ethanol plant, Elmworth gas plant, Lloydminster upgrader and Christina Lake, as well as methane reduction initiatives across the company's conventional operations.\n\nCenovus is also a member of the Pathways Alliance, a consortium of Canada's largest oilsands companies which has pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from oilsands operations by 2050.\n\nThe Pathways companies have jointly pledged to spend approximately $24 billion on emissions reduction projects before 2030. However, none of that pledged spending appears in Cenovus' 2023 budget.\n\nPourbaix said the projects the Pathways group are proposing in particular, a massive, proposed carbon capture and storage network that would sequester carbon from the oilsands and transport it to a central storage hub are major pieces of infrastructure that take time to develop.\n\n\"We certainly don't have our permits yet that were going to require from the provincial and potentially the federal governments. These larger scale projects just take a bit of time to get everything in place,\" he said.\n\n\"I think what youre going to see is . . . a relatively back-end-loaded investment as we get more toward the end of the decade.\"\n\nWhile the federal government has already committed to an investment tax credit that will support companies with the capital costs of building carbon capture and storage projects, Pathways member companies also want to see some government support for the ongoing costs of operating such projects.\n\nLast week, political opponents and some business groups suggested Alberta Premier Danielle Smith could be getting in the way of industry goals with her proposed Alberta sovereignty act, which was recently unveiled in the provincial legislature.\n\nThese critics said the proposed act threatens to scare off investors and could make it more difficult for the province's energy sector to work collaboratively with the federal government.\n\nBut Pourbaix said it's too early to know exactly what the impact of the proposed legislation could be.\n\n\"I would just say as a general comment, in our industry, it really is important that the federal and provincial governments maintain a constructive working relationship to address any number of challenges. And the situation with net-zero aspirations would fit right in there,\" he said.\n\n\"But its really hard to know at this point how exactly it might be used, or what its impact might be. To this point, I have not heard anything from investors who have indicated theyre worried about it. So well just watch it and see how things go.\"\n\nCenovus now expects to reach its net debt target of $4 billion by year-end 2022, at which point it will begin returning 100 per cent of excess free cash flow to shareholders.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 6, 2022.",

                "cc_text": "BRUSSELS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven price cap on Russian seaborne oil came into force on Monday as the West tries to limit Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production.\n\nThe price cap, to be enforced by the G7 nations, the European Union and Australia, comes on top of the EU's embargo on imports of Russian crude by sea and similar pledges by the United States, Canada, Japan and Britain.\n\nIt allows Russian oil to be shipped to third-party countries using G7 and EU tankers, insurance companies and credit institutions, only if the cargo is bought at or below the price cap.\n\nAs the world's key shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the cap could make it difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price.\n\nRussia, which is the world's second-largest oil exporter, said on Sunday it would not accept the cap and would not sell oil that is subject to it, even if it has to cut production.\n\nSelling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources of Russian foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War Two.\n\nAn aerial view shows the Vladimir Arsenyev tanker at the crude oil terminal Kozmino on the shore of Nakhodka Bay near the port city of Nakhodka, Russia August 12, 2022. REUTERS/Tatiana Meel Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nA source who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the situation told Reuters that a decree was being prepared to prohibit Russian companies and traders from interacting with countries and companies guided by the cap.\n\nIn essence, such a decree would ban the export of oil and petroleum products to countries and companies that apply it.\n\nStill, with the price cap set at $60 per barrel, not much below the $67 level where it closed on Friday , the EU and G7 countries expect Russia will still have an incentive to continue selling oil at that price, while accepting smaller profits.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said on Monday that Beijing would continue its energy cooperation with Russia on the basis of respect and mutual benefit, following the EU's agreement of the price cap, Russias RIA news agency reported.\n\nThe level of the cap is to be reviewed by the EU and the G7 every two months, with the first such review in mid-January.\n\n\"This review should take into account... the effectiveness of the measure, its implementation, international adherence and alignment, the potential impact on coalition members and partners, and market developments,\" the European Commission said in a statement.\n\nThe cap on crude will be followed by a similar measure affecting Russian petroleum products that will come into force on Feb. 5, though the level of that cap has not yet been determined.\n\nReporting by Jan Strupczewski; Editing by David Holmes and Gareth Jones\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

It brought a welcome dose of warmth and wisdom from industry experts. Zoltan Pozsar, Ray Dalio, Peter Diamandis, Felix Zulauf, and Barry Habib.\n\nWith the impending recession, I figured itd be a good time to take another look at Dalios Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crisis. I get into that more at the end of this newsletter. In some of the biggest international news of the week, the G7 agreed to a cap on Russian oil prices, specifically linked to the insurance of carriers. There are broad implications, of course. One of them, as Zoltan Pozsar wrote extensively about, has to do with how the oil cap affects the United States oil reserves and the valuation of gold. I share Pozsars main points and my key takeaways below.\n\nPeter Diamandis also shared an exciting look at the future of connectivity, complete with satellite \"mega-constellations,\" and I share Barry Habibs award-winning forecast of what the real estate market will do in the months to come.

Before joining Credit Suisse in February 2015, Mr. Pozsar was a senior adviser to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, advising the Offices of Debt Management and Financial Research and serving as the Treasurys liaison to the FSB on matters of financial innovation. Mr. Pozsar was deeply involved in the response to the 2008 global financial crisis and the ensuing policy debate. He joined the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in August 2008 in charge of market intelligence for securitized credit markets and served as the point-person on market developments for senior Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury, and White House officials throughout the crisis. He also played an instrumental role in building the TALF to backstop the ABS market and pioneered the mapping of the shadow banking system, which inspired the FSBs effort to monitor and regulate shadow banking globally. Later at the IMF, he was involved in framing the Funds official position on shadow banking. He consulted G-20 working groups as well as G-7 policymakers, central banks, and finance ministries on global macro-financial developments. (Source: Credit Suisse) Additionally, he writes for VoxEU in a personal capacity. Mr. Pozsar has published several ground-breaking papers on the financial eco-system and wrote extensively on the global economy, most recently with Paul McCulley (formerly of PIMCO) on fiscal and monetary policy in a liquidity trap. Pozsars December 2022 letter to clients focuses on the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), Russian oil, and gold. Here are some of the key points: November 2021: President Joe Biden released 50 million barrels of oil from the SPR.\n\nMarch 2022: President Biden released 1 million barrels of oil per day for the next six months.\n\nOctober 2022: 15 million barrels released; White House says it will look to replenish the reserve.\n\nNovember-December 2022: SPR is now at a 40-year low of 400 million barrels. Given OPEC+ production cuts, end of SPR releases, re-routing of Russian oil to Asia, etc., Pozsar weighs whether the U.S. should release more oil or if its time for the United States to refill the SPR. The release and sale of so many SPR reserves dampen hopes of managing increased energy prices and, by extension, inflation.\n\nThe White House originally planned to replenish reserves when oil prices dropped below $80; now, the price target is $70. Pozsar: \"That plan [of refilling reserves when prices hit low] is hard to reconcile with OPEC+s price target near $100 per barrel. Yes, we are headed toward a recession, but unlike in 2008 or during Paul Volckers reign, oil prices arent collapsing as production capacity hasnt grown recently.\" On the role of Russian oil in refilling the SPR, he says: Russian crude trades at a $30 discount to Brent Oil, which helps buyers like China and India make significant profit margins by turning Russian oil into diesel fuel (sold at around $140).\n\nBrent Oil is trading at ~$77 dollars per barrel today. Take $30 off that price, you get $47. Buy for $47, convert into diesel, and sell for $140.\n\nThis spread makes big money for India and China.\n\nPozsar quoted Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to show that the United States changed its stance on purchasers of Russian oil. Yellen said, \"The United States is happy for India to continue buying as much Russian oil as it wants, including at prices above a G7-imposed price cap mechanism, if it steers clear of Western insurance, finance, and maritime services bound by the cap.\"\n\nPozsar says this could be one \"backdoor mechanism\" to refill the SPR within President Bidens target price. Heres the state of play: If the U.S. values Russian crude at $60 and Russia values its oil at a price for a gram of gold, then \"the U.S. dollar effectively gets revalued versus Russian oil.\" Pozsar: \"The cap of $60 per barrel for Russian oil equals the price of a gram of gold.\"\n\nHypothetically, Poszar explains that \"if the West is looking for a bargain, Russia can give a bargain the West cant refuse: a gram for more [oil]. If Russia countered the price peg of $60 with offering two barrels of oil at the peg for a gram of gold, gold prices double.\"\n\nPozsar doesnt believe Russia will increase production to these levels, but \"gold going from $1,800 to close to $3,600 would increase the value of Russias gold reserves and its gold output at home and in a range of countries in Africa. Crazy? Yes. Improbable? No.\"\n\nIf Russia opts to link its oil to gold, it could bring gold back as a medium of settlement, and its intrinsic value would sharply increase.\n\nThe big issue, however, is this presents a liquidity risk for banks involved in the paper gold market. The key thing here is that gold doubling would be an issue for banks involved with futures markets for hedging and speculative purposes. Should governments pay for oil with gold, this would create an overnight liquidity crisis at the banks. Pozsar explains: \"Banks active in the paper gold market would face a liquidity shortfall, as all banks active in commodities tend to be long OTC derivative receivables hedged with futures (an asymmetric liquidity position). Thats a risk we dont think enough about and a risk that could complicate the coming year-end turn, as a sharp move in gold prices could force an unexpected mobilization of reserves (from the o/n RRP facility to banks) and expansions in balance sheets (SLR) and risk-weighted assets. Thats the last thing we need around year-end.\" Conclusion: The U.S. needs to re-fill the SPR. Its been releasing inventory, attempting to hold down the price of oil. The SPR inventory now stands at a 40-year low and may be depleted by April 2023. Inventory will have to be rebuilt. If Russia doesnt want India to export diesel to the U.S., Russia can ask for payment in gold instead of rupees. If Russia countered the price peg of $60 by offering two barrels of oil at the peg for a gram of gold, gold prices would double. More oil would go to Europe than to the U.S. through India. And strategically for Russia, gold going from $1,800 to close to $3,600 would increase the value of Russias gold reserves. Not likely, but not impossible. If this were to happen, banks active in the paper gold market would face a liquidity shortfall. Banks have been managing their paper gold books with the assumption that states would ensure gold wouldnt come back as a settlement medium. If Russia makes this move, the U.S. dollar may be \"revalued\" versus Russian oil, and a liquidity crunch would follow. The point is, the system is complex and ripe for disruption. Keep your eye on this issue. Some allocation to gold is a good idea in an investment portfolio.

Terrestrial and space-based global connectivity will add an additional 2 billion new minds into the global economy and spur conversations representative of new consumers and creators, who will drive tens of trillions of dollars into the global economy. In todays blog, well look at how \"mega-constellations\" of satellites and the rollout of 5G and 6G networks will usher in a new era of abundance and innovation. Heres how he describes what this future world of connectivity and satellite mega-constellations looks like: With 5G and eventually 6G on the ground and satellite mega-constellations blanketing the Earth from space, we are on the verge of connecting every person on the planet with gigabit connection speeds at de minimis cost. These systems will connect 8 billion humans and trillions of sensors. In this world, a decade from now, youll be able to connect to anyone and anything, anytime, anywhere We are heading towards a world of ubiquitous and abundant knowledge. And because innovation is a function of the number of humans connected to each other, enabled by tools and powered by knowledge, as these numbers all steadily increase, were about to witness perhaps the most historic acceleration of technological innovation ever experienced by humanity.

John shared his thoughts on what he calls the \"Great Reset.\" Not the World Economic Forums crazy vision of a new world order but the \"reset\" in which sovereign debts, pension promises, and entitlement systems get restructured. John says well all be OKbut brace yourself. The reset will come in crisis, and it wont be pleasant. A guest pointed out the extreme political divide between the two parties and much of the nation, asking, \"How do we bridge this divide to get something done?\" John likened it to then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson kneeling before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2008 in a bid to keep the Democratic caucus on board with the Great Financial Crisis bailout package so it could get through Congress and onto the presidents desk before the credit markets seized up. Like in 2008, well bridge the divide when we come to the edge of the cliff and realize we have to restructure the system. We believe well reach that point sometime in the second half of this decade. On the plane to Florida, I reread Dalios book Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crisis. Its a study of more than 500 years of history and human behavior. Essentially, weve been here before. Most countries have chosen to print their way out of mess of debt, but that hasnt always been the case. When it gets too large, debt is a growth headwind; at some point, it needs to be paid back. Thus, its also a deflationary inhibitor. Governments and central banks have levers they can pull to help navigate various challenges: raising and lowering interest rates, asset purchases, QE, QT, protecting systemically important companies, lettering others defaults, helicoptering cash to the people, etc. Weve seen the Fed implement some creative tools since 2008, including buying junk bond ETFs in 2022. Are these outside of the Feds mandate? Yes. Is that going to stop them? No. The point is, we have choices. Dalio believes theres the potential for what he calls \"a beautiful deleveraging.\" But it comes down to our collective dependence on elected officials, the Fed, other countries, and their central banks. For one thing, we dont yet know who the elected officials will be. John and I believe deleveraging will come from a combination of debt restructuring, debt monetization, saving some big companies, letting others default, as well as more QE, helicopter money, higher taxes (John argues for a Value-Added Tax), asset purchases to stop the bleeding, and who knows what else. \"Beautiful\" is possible but getting there is complex and far from certain. The ride along the way will be bumpy. Youll have to remember: It was a painful financial experience for most, but many people made a lot of money. Thats our point. Our good friend and real estate expert Barry Habib joined us for the dinner, and I asked him to give everyone his take on the housing and mortgage markets. (He is a three-time Zillow Crystal Ball Award winneran award given to the most accurate real estate and mortgage forecaster in the U.S.) Barry painted a very bullish view of single-family and multi-family housing, citing the demographics around household formations and the lack of housing inventory. He believes inflation peaked in early November and that the descent will be apparent to all in January. When I spoke with him three weeks ago, mortgage rates were at 7%. Theyre now at 6%, and he believes theyll be down to 5% in January. His advice? \"Buy, dont sell!\" For more from Barry, look out for a podcast episode Ill be doing with him soon. Our dinner guests asked excellent questions. The food and wine were fantastic, as was the 80-degree weather. We plan to host a number of dinners around the country in the months to come. Stay tuned for future dateswe hope youll be able to join us. While writing today, I watched the Brazil vs. Croatia quarterfinal World Cup game, and the end came down to a penalty kick shootout. Argentina vs. Netherlands finished tied at the end of 90 minutes, and as Im about to hit send, Messe just made the first PK in the penalty kick shootout. In case youre planning to watch the games later, Ill not share the results. But I will say: Wowexciting games. Morroco vs. Portugal and England vs. France are on deck for tomorrow. So much fun.

                "cc_text": "On December 3, 2022, G7 members formally set the highly anticipated price cap on Russian oil at 60 USD per barrel. This price cap applies to crude oil, petroleum oils, and oils obtained from bituminous minerals which originate in or are exported from Russia. Below we summarize (1) some of the key aspects of the G7s price cap, and (2) the measures taken to implement the price cap by the EU,US, UK, Japan and Canada.\n\nKey aspects of the G7 price cap include:\n\nThe price cap establishes a framework for Russian seaborne crude oil and petroleum products to be exported to third countries under a capped price to achieve three objectives: (i) maintain a reliable supply of seaborne Russian crude oil and petroleum products to the global market; (ii) reduce upward pressure on energy prices; and (iii) reduce Russias revenues.\n\nThe level of the cap was established in close cooperation with the Price Cap Coalition and became applicable on December 5, 2022.\n\nThe decision sets the level at which the exemption apply, and introduces a transition period of 45 days for vessels carrying crude oil originating in Russia, purchased and loaded onto the vessel prior to December 5, 2022 and unloaded at the final port of destination prior to January 19, 2023. As the price cap may be periodically reviewed to adapt to the market situation, the decision also sets a transition period of 90 days after every change in the price cap, to ensure coherent implementation of the price cap by all operators.\n\nThe functioning of the price cap mechanism will be reviewed every two months to respond to developments in the market, and will be set at least 5% below the average market price for Russian oil and petroleum products, calculated on the basis of data provided by the International Energy Agency.\n\nEU-Specific Updates\n\nOn October 6, 2022, the Council of the European Union (\"the Council\") adopted a decision prohibiting the maritime transport of Russian crude oil (as of December 5, 2022) and petroleum products (as of February 5, 2023) to third countries, and the related provision of technical assistance, brokering services or financing or financial assistance. The Council decision also introduced an exemption from the above-mentioned prohibitions for crude oil or petroleum products which originate in or are exported from Russia, and are purchased at or below a pre-established price cap agreed by the Price Cap Coalition, the price cap exemption.\n\nThe Council also introduced an \"emergency clause\" which allows the transport of oil beyond the price cap or the provision of technical assistance, brokering services or financing or financial assistance related to the transport, when these are necessary for the urgent prevention or mitigation of an event likely to have a serious and significant impact on human health and safety or the environment, or as a response to natural disasters.\n\nIn addition to the legislation introduced by the EU, the European Commission published an FAQ for guidance on the Oil Price Cap.\n\nUS Specific Updates\n\nThe United States Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") issued this fact sheet and this statement following the announcement of the price cap. OFAC also issued this determination setting the price cap to USD 60 per barrel. This comes just a few weeks after OFAC issued a separate determination on the price cap along with this guidance on the implementation of the price cap policy. Our previous blog post on these items can be found here. OFAC also issued preliminary guidance in September 2022, which weve blogged on here.\n\nUK Specific Updates\n\nThe UK has announced a cap on seaborne Russian oil at USD 60, which came into force on 5 December 2022. It is in line with the EU restrictions discussed above, including in relation to the transition period for which there is a General Licence.\n\nThe cap is implemented in conjunction with the UKs ban on the maritime supply and delivery of Russian oil and oil products to a third country or from one third country to another third country (which came into effect on 5 December 2022 for oil and will come into effect on 5 February 2022 for oil products). It also prohibits the provision of related financial services, funds and brokering services. Exemptions to both prohibitions are available under a General Licence, which applies to oil and oil products sold under the price cap.\n\nFurther General Licences are available in relation to certain correspondent banking and payment processing and to certain listed projects and countries.\n\nThe UK Government has published guidance in relation to the price cap.\n\nJapan Specific Updates\n\nThe Japanese Government announced that there will be:\n\nAn import ban in relation to crude oil that is of Russian origin, and which is sold at a higher price than the designated capped price. Imports of such oil will require a license by the Minister of the Economy, Trade and Industry.\n\nA service ban in relation to crude oil that is of Russian origin, and which is sold at a higher price than the designated capped price. Anyone wanting to offer loan contracts, guarantee contracts, set off debts contracts or provide services designated by the MOF or METI notice should obtain a license from the authority.\n\nPlease note that these measures do not apply to crude oil generated by the \"Sakhalin 2\" project.\n\nCanada Specific Updates\n\nCanada has amended its sanctions measures in response to the G7 oil cap to prohibit certain marine transportation services. Specifically, the amendments prohibit persons in Canada and Canadians outside Canada to provide specified marine transportation services (i.e. financing, shipping, re/insurance, customs brokering, flagging, protection/indemnity, trading and commodities brokering), including ship-to-ship transfers of specified petroleum and petroleum products, if those products are:\n\nexported from Russia or originate in Russia;\n\nare purchased above USD 60; and\n\nif the service relates to sea, costal or inland water transport generally, or to passenger or freight transport industries as defined by Division 50 of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 4, published by the United Nations in 2008.\n\nCanadas Russian oil and petroleum product import ban, implemented on March 10, 2022, remains in effect.",

Most energy sanctions, like those against Iran and Venezuela, target volume, not price.\n\n\"What policymakers are trying to do is cut the world's largest oil exporter out of the market to a large degree,\" he says. \"They're trying to cut Russia off from Europe, which has always been one of its largest export destinations.\"\n\nMost of EU will stop buying any Russian oil\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe EU ban on seaborne Russian oil imports is part of a package of sanctions passed in June. It also includes barring maritime services such as shipping insurance and financial services on any tanker carrying Russian crude. Hungary and a couple of other countries can continue to import Russian oil through pipelines.\n\nMost of the world's maritime services for oil tankers are based in the U.K. and the European Union, so that ban would apply to virtually all tankers plying the world's waters.\n\nThe U.S. was concerned that the EU ban on oil and insurance could remove at least a million barrels a day of Russian crude off the market, causing a sharp spike in the price. Russia supplies about 10% of the world's oil production.\n\n\"The EU sanctions package created concerns that there would be a potential supply shock,\" Cahill, the energy analyst, says. \"And so the proposed price cap is a way to try to keep those volumes on the market, but still curtail Russia's revenue.\"\n\nThe price cap is meant to keep supply coming but limit Russia's profits\n\nAllowing oil sales under a price limit is a way to make sure the insurance ban doesn't stop the oil from flowing. Under the plan, shipping services and insurance could be provided to tankers carrying Russian crude as long as it is purchased for a price set by Western nations.\n\nAll 27 members of the EU needed to agree on the price. Poland pushed for around $20 per barrel, a figure rejected by many EU countries as too low. The final price was agreed at $60 per barrel, which could fluctuate over time. A mechanism that Poland pushed for was included in the final deal the price cap would be kept at least %5 below the market rate.\n\nRussian crude oil already sells well below other global oil market prices.\n\nIt was a balancing act between finding a price low enough to limit Russia's profits but high enough to keep the country producing oil.\n\nOver the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the $60 price cap \"a weak position\" and warned that Russian oil earnings would still top $100 billion a year.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has long warned that Russia will not sell oil to any country taking part in the price cap. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak repeated that on Sunday, adding that the Kremlin is prepared to cut oil production if necessary.\n\nUncertainty over the Western restrictions and Russia's energy threats has spilled over into global oil markets.\n\nOn Sunday, members of an alliance of oil-producing countries that includes Russia and Saudi Arabia but not the U.S. opted to maintain current production levels. Analysts saw the move by the alliance known as OPEC+ as taking a wait-and-see approach to how markets will react. The group indicated it could meet again any time to make changes.\n\nChina and India buy Russian oil and it's unclear how they view the price cap\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sergei Bobylyov/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images Sergei Bobylyov/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThere's skepticism that the price cap will work. For one thing, it will need other countries beyond the G-7 and the EU to sign on to the plan.\n\nChina and India are key. Both have gone on a buying spree of Russian oil since the war in Ukraine.\n\nArkady Gevorkyan, a commodity strategist at Citi Research, says India imported very little oil from Russia before the conflict. Now, it's helping fill the Kremlin's coffers, importing about 900,000 barrels a day, which he says is substantial. \"That allowed Russians to divert some of the oil initially going to Europe, to India,\" Gevorkyan says.\n\nChina, India and Turkey have been getting Russian oil at a big discount -- about $20 less per barrel. They'll continue to hammer out a good price if they believe they have leverage once the price cap sets in.\n\nCahill says efforts to get countries outside the G-7 on board with the plans have not been successful, in part because they're wary of the complicated plan.\n\n\"I think there's also some irritation with Western sanctions and the idea that, you know, the U.S. and the EU are really pushing countries to do this and they're interfering with the global oil market,\" Cahill adds. \"They have a lot of skepticism. And I don't think that India and China will sign the plan and fully endorse it.\"\n\nAnd according to Gevorkyan, there's some doubt Russia can find enough tankers willing and able to work around the sanctions.\n\nAnd then there's the question of insurance. \"Russia started to work on developing its domestic insurance company,\" he says. \"It has been in discussion with China and India and other trade partners of having a different insurance that would allow them to continue to import.\"\n\nEnforcing the price cap will be a challenge\n\nThe G-7 price cap plan depends heavily on documentation and proof about where the oil on a tanker is coming from and how much it costs.\n\nMichelle Wiese Bockmann, an analyst with London-based Lloyd's List, a maritime news agency, says there's already a lot of illicit oil trade, especially moving sanctioned oil from Iran and Venezuela. She says it involves everything from falsifying documents to clandestine ship-to-ship transfers in the middle of the night.\n\n\"The evasion tactics used by Iran and Venezuela can be easily met and borrowed by Russia to continue shipping without that compliance to the price cap,\" she says. \"It's very likely that sanctions evasion is going to be a hallmark of what happens post Dec. 5.\"",

The strikes plunged parts of Ukraine back into freezing darkness with temperatures now firmly below zero Celsius (32 Fahrenheit).\n\nAt least four people were killed in the Russian missile attacks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, adding that most of some 70 missiles were shot down. Energy workers had already begun work on restoring power supplies, he said.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two air bases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged by pieces of the drones when they were shot down.\n\nUkraine did not directly claim responsibility for the attacks. If it was behind them, they would be the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nOne of the targets, the Engels air base near the city of Saratov, around 730 km (450 miles) southeast of Moscow, houses bomber planes belonging to Russia's strategic nuclear forces.\n\n\"The Kyiv regime, in order to disable Russian long-range aircraft, made attempts to strike with Soviet-made unmanned jet aerial vehicles at the military airfields Dyagilevo, in the Ryazan region, and Engels, in the Saratov region,\" the Russian defence ministry said.\n\nIt said the drones, flying at low altitude, were intercepted by air defences and shot down.

Ukraine says they are clearly aimed at civilians and thus constitute a war crime.\n\nWESTERN PRICE CAP ON RUSSIAN OIL\n\nA $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil took effect on Monday, the latest Western measure to punish Moscow over its invasion. Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter.\n\nThe agreement allows Russian oil to be shipped to third-party countries using tankers from G7 and European Union member states, insurance companies and credit institutions, only if the cargo is bought at or below the $60 per barrel cap.\n\nMoscow has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. Ukraine wants the cap set lower: Zelenskiy said $60 was too high to deter Russia's assault.\n\nA Russian oil blend was selling for around $79 a barrel in Asian markets on Monday - almost a third higher than the price cap, according to Refinitiv data and estimates from industry sources.\n\nReporting by Nick Starkov and Reuters bureaus; Writing by Philippa Fletcher and Mark Heinrich; Editing by Peter Graff and Angus MacSwan\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "LawFlash US Matches EU $60 Price Cap on Russian Crude Oil Delivered by Sea December 08, 2022\n\nThe US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control issued a Determination on December 5 implementing a $60 \"price cap\" on Russian crude oil, pursuant to which US persons are authorized to provide otherwise prohibited services. The waiver applies only to the maritime transit of Russian oil purchased at or below the price cap.\n\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) Determination was issued pursuant to Section 1(a)(ii) of Executive Order (EO) 14071.\n\nTHE PRICE CAP POLICY\n\nSince April 22, 2022, the United States has prohibited the import of most petroleum products from Russia. However, the prohibition on imports included in EO 14066 does not restrict US persons from arranging or otherwise facilitating the transport of Russian oil into jurisdictions that have not themselves prohibited the import of Russian oil.\n\nIn an effort to further limit Russias oil revenues without imposing additional secondary sanctions, and while simultaneously trying to stabilize global energy supply, the United States instituted the price cap. As part of a more coordinated multilateral approach to sanctions, the G7 (the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom) and Australia agreed to adopt the $60 per barrel cap proposed by the European Union. The countries that agreed to the price cap have either already banned the import of Russian oil or have committed to prohibiting or phasing out such imports. The policy aims to strike a balance between maintaining a reliable global supply of oil and hindering Russias oil revenues. OFAC expects the price cap to be particularly relevant to emerging markets and low-income economies that are susceptible to rising energy prices.\n\nCOVERED SERVICES\n\nThe scope of the Determinations prohibited actions is broad and applies to the following services (collectively, Covered Services):\n\nTrading/commodities brokering\n\nFinancing\n\nShipping\n\nInsurance\n\nFlagging\n\nCustoms brokering\n\nAs of December 5, 2022, \"the exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person . . . of any Covered Services to any person located in the Russian Federation\" is prohibited unless the relevant crude oil is priced at $60 per barrel or below at the time of purchase. Shipping, freight, customs, and insurance costs are not included in the price cap.\n\nThe Determination excludes Covered Services relating to Russian-origin crude oil that was \"loaded\" prior to 12:01 am EST on December 5, 2022, and \"unloaded\" at the port of destination prior to 12:01 am EST on January 19, 2023. See OFAC FAQ 1094.\n\nAccording to guidance OFAC released in connection with the Determination (the Guidance), the price cap applies from the time the crude oil (defined at Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States subheading 2709.00) is sold by a Russian entity for maritime transport to when the oil clears customs in a new jurisdiction. If the oil is taken back out on the water without being substantially transformed, the price cap still applies. The maritime transport limitation means oil delivered by pipelines would not be covered (including pipelines that might be in or under water, presumably). Once the oil is substantially transformed, or once it is sold again onshore, the cap does not apply because the oil is no longer considered oil of Russian origin.\n\nIt should be noted that EO 14071 and the Determination speak to the provision of Covered Services to persons \"in the Russian Federation\" while the Guidance does not contain that limiting language. This raises the question how broadly OFAC will interpret that limitation when deciding whether to pursue an enforcement action. Limiting Covered Services based on the location of the receiving entity aligns with other Russia sanctions, which include similar limitations. See. e.g., Determination Pursuant to Section 1(a)(ii) of EO 14071 (May 8, 2022).\n\nSAFE HARBOR FROM OFAC ENFORCEMENT\n\nUnderstanding that business operations require time to comply with new restrictions, OFAC has established a \"safe harbor\" for US persons providing Covered Services if the US persons maintain certain records and meet specific attestation requirements.\n\nThe safe harbor applies across three \"tiers\" of actors throughout the oil supply chain and the safe harbor requirements differ between tiers. The tiers operate on a sliding scale: the more direct access to price information a US person has, the greater the diligence requirements that apply to verify that the price is at or below the cap.\n\nThe tiers are as follows:\n\nTier 1 : Actors with direct access to price information, including commodities brokers and traders These actors must retain price information and provide information and attestation to tiers 2 and 3, as needed. For example, tier 1 actors may retain invoices, contracts, receipts, and proof of payment.\n\n: Actors with direct access to price information, including commodities brokers and traders Tier 2 : Actors sometimes able to request price information, including institutions financing trade, customs brokers, and ship/vessel agents These actors must request and retain price information to the extent practicable, or obtain attestation from a tier 1 actor, or customer or counterparty.\n\n: Actors sometimes able to request price information, including institutions financing trade, customs brokers, and ship/vessel agents Tier 3 : Actors without direct access to price information, including insurers, reinsurers, P&I clubs, ship owners and carriers, and flagging registries These actors must receive attestation from tier 1 or 2 actors, a customer, or a counterparty. Attestation examples include sanctions exclusions clauses in policies, clauses that exclude coverage for activities related to the maritime transit of Russian oil purchased above the price cap, and price cap attestation itself.\n\n: Actors without direct access to price information, including insurers, reinsurers, P&I clubs, ship owners and carriers, and flagging registries\n\nIf Covered Service providers comply with these processes and neither know nor have reason to know that they are violating the Determination, then OFAC is unlikely to pursue enforcement actions against them. As a general matter, and consistent with past OFAC policies, the agency suggests that it does not intend to enforce against persons who act in good faith but nevertheless violate the Determination as a result of falsified or erroneous records.\n\nGENERAL LICENSES\n\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the Determination and the Guidance, OFAC issued three new general licenses authorizing US persons to engage in services related to Russian oil even where the price cap has not been satisfied.\n\nSakhalin 2 : GL 55 authorizes services related to crude oil originating from the Sakhalin-2 project for import into Japan.\n\n: GL 55 authorizes services related to crude oil originating from the Sakhalin-2 project for import into Japan. EU Derogations : GL 56 authorizes certain transactions when the oil is imported into specific EU countries. These include: Bulgaria : From December 5, 2022, to December 31, 2024, parties may execute contracts (and ancillary agreements) concluded before June 4, 2022, for seaborne crude oil (CN 2709 00) and petroleum products from Russia (CN 2710) for import into Bulgaria. Croatia : Import into Croatia is allowedfrom February 5, 2023, to December 31, 2023for vacuum gas oil (CN 2710 19 71) originating in or exported from Russia if no alternative for such oil exists and Croatia notifies and receives permission from the European Commission. Landlocked EU Member States : If the supply by pipeline of oil from Russia is interrupted for reasons outside the countrys control, that country may import seaborne crude oil from Russia (CN 2709 00) until pipeline supply is resumed or the EU Council terminates the exemption.\n\n: GL 56 authorizes certain transactions when the oil is imported into specific EU countries. These include: Emergency Services for Vessels: GL 57 authorizes otherwise prohibited transactions that are ordinarily incident and necessary to address vessel emergencies related to the health or safety of the crew or environmental protection, including safe docking or anchoring, emergency repairs, or salvage operations.\n\nFINAL TAKEAWAYS\n\nThe Determination implementing the price cap took effect December 5, 2022. This policy parallels the Biden administrations decision to waive certain oil-related sanctions on Venezuela and allow Chevron to restart limited production in that country. While the administration has denied it, these policies could be seen as a tandem effort to reduce oil prices globally while having the simultaneous benefit of limiting Russias influence over Venezuela.\n\nThe situation remains fluid and evolving. Russia has indicated that it will not sell oil subject to the price cap. Meanwhile, OFAC also announced it would institute a similar price cap on Russian-origin petroleum products starting February 5, 2023. Compliance obligations will need to be updated in tandem with those changes.\n\nUKRAINE CONFLICT: HOW TO MAINTAIN GLOBAL BUSINESS CONTINUITY\n\nOur lawyers have long been trusted advisers to clients navigating the complex and quickly changing global framework of international sanctions.

He was praised for providing thousands of Starlink satellite internet devices, made by Musks SpaceX, to Ukraine free of charge but the friendship ran into difficulties in October when Musk voiced support for peace conditions rejected by Kyiv.\n\nUpdated at 13.04 EST\n\n4 Dec 2022 12.14 EST There is currently no diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine, Irina Scherbakova, a co-founder of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Russian rights organisation Memorial, said. \"I am absolutely convinced that there is not a diplomatic solution with Putins regime, so long as it is still there,\" she said. \"The solution that there will now be is a military one,\" said Scherbakova, who was presented with an award for her human rights work at a ceremony in Hamburg, Germany. \"But these decisions, this diplomacy will only happen when Ukraine believes it has won this war and can set its terms.\" Scherbakova added that calls for peace were \"childish\", she said, adding that things would not return to the way they were before the outbreak of the conflict. \"This war has turned so many things upside down, it will never be like that again.\"\n\nUpdated at 12.27 EST\n\n4 Dec 2022 11.44 EST After major oil-producing countries led by Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to maintain their current output levels on Sunday ahead of fresh sanctions against Moscow next week, Russias deputy prime minister Alexander Novak said: \"We will sell oil and oil products to countries that will work with us on market terms, even if we have to reduce production somewhat.\" Even though \"inflation, the tightening of monetary policies and Chinas Covid-19 epidemic\" were posing risks to the market, it was still \"in a better state than two months ago\", Novak said, according to Russian news agencies. \"We are currently working on mechanisms to prohibit the use of the price cap tool at any level\", Novak added, stating that \"such interference\" could only cause \"further market destabilisation and scarcity of energy resources\", AFP reports. Moscow had repeatedly denounced the incoming oil price-cap, threatening to suspend deliveries to any country that adopted the measure.\n\nUpdated at 12.12 EST\n\n4 Dec 2022 11.16 EST Military medics looks at a body of a Ukrainian soldier that was brought to a frontline field hospital, near Bakhmut, Donetsk region, Ukraine.

The G7 and Australia agreed to the price-cap on Friday.\n\nOPEC+ has agreed to stick to its oil output targets at a meeting on Sunday. OPEC+, which comprises the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia, angered the US and other western nations in October when it agreed to cut output by 2m barrels a day (bpd), about 2% of world demand, from November until the end of 2023.\n\nA draft resolution is circulating at the United Nations in New York for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to hold the Russian leadership accountable for crimes of aggression in Ukraine.\n\nMore than 500 Ukrainian localities remained without power on Sunday following weeks of Russian airstrikes on the electric grid, an interior ministry official said.\n\nUkraine is imposing sanctions on 10 senior clerics linked to a pro-Moscow church on the grounds they agreed to work with Russian occupation authorities or justified Moscows invasion, the security service said.\n\nUpdated at 10.50 EST\n\n4 Dec 2022 09.56 EST More on Russias response to the $60 a barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil. Reuters reports Russia will not sell oil that is subject to a western price cap even if it has to cut production, quoting President Vladimir Putins point man on energy. The Group of Seven and Australia agreed to the price cap on Friday. The move to prohibit shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargoes of Russian crude above the cap, is an attempt to punish Putin for the Ukraine conflict, Reuters reports. The Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said on Sunday the move by the west was a gross interference that contradicted the rules of free trade and would destabilise global energy markets by triggering a shortage of supply. He said:\n\nWe are working on mechanisms to prohibit the use of a price cap instrument, regardless of what level is set, because such interference could further destabilise the market. We will sell oil and petroleum products only to those countries that will work with us under market conditions, even if we have to reduce production a little.\n\nNovak said the western cap could trigger trouble in the products markets and could affect other countries beside Russia. A source who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the situation told Reuters that a decree was being prepared to prohibit Russian companies and traders from interacting with countries and companies guided by the cap. In essence, such a decree would ban the export of oil and petroleum products to countries and companies that apply it. Putin in September warned the west that he could cut off energy supplies if price caps were imposed, telling them that Europe would be \"frozen\" like a wolfs tail, in a reference to a well-known Russian fairytale. Russia can access enough tankers to ship most of its oil beyond the reach of a new G7 price cap, industry players and a US official told Reuters in October, underscoring the limits of the most ambitious plan yet to curb Moscows wartime revenue.\n\nUpdated at 10.00 EST\n\n4 Dec 2022 09.25 EST Patrick Wintour A draft resolution is circulating at the United Nations in New York for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to hold the Russian leadership accountable for crimes of aggression in Ukraine. There are signs that US opposition to the proposal may be softening in the face of lobbying by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Beth Van Schaack, the US ambassador for global criminal justice, said this week: \"Its something that President Zelenskiy cares deeply about. This is something Ukraine wants, and I think thats going to carry a lot of weight. The question is, will they have the votes at the general assembly?\" She added: \"So far, all of the [general assembly] resolutions on Ukraine have prevailed. The numbers have been quite strong.\" The international criminal court has already started investigating war crimes in Ukraine, but Ukraines leadership argues that the ICC is hampered in that while it can try those charged with individual war crimes, it cannot prosecute the Kremlin leadership over the broader crime of aggression since Russia is not a signatory to the relevant statute.

Russia will not operate under a price cap, even if Moscow has to cut production, Novak said.\n\nUpdated at 08.58 EST\n\n4 Dec 2022 07.26 EST More than 500 Ukrainian localities remained without power on Sunday following weeks of Russian airstrikes on the electric grid, an interior ministry official said. \"The enemy continues to attack the countrys essential infrastructure. Currently, 507 localities in eight regions of our country are cut off from electricity supplies,\" deputy interior minister Yevgueny Yenin told Ukrainian television, AFP reports. \"The Kharkiv region is the worst hit with 112 isolated villages,\" Yenin added. A further 90 villages were cut off in the Donetsk and Kherson regions, he said, with others in the regions of Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia and Lugansk. Repeated daily power cuts have left millions of people without heat or lighting while outside temperatures have dropped below zero Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) in recent days. With further strikes on the network widely expected, Ukrainians fear a difficult prolonged winter as well as a flood of departures by refugees from a war now into a tenth month. Private Ukrainian energy operator DTEK said on Thursday that nearly half of Ukraines electricity grid remains damaged after Russia began targeting Ukrainian energy facilities in October.\n\nUpdated at 08.59 EST\n\n4 Dec 2022 07.06 EST OPEC+ has agreed to stick to its oil output targets at a meeting on Sunday, two OPEC+ sources told Reuters. The decision comes two days after the Group of Seven (G7) nations agreed a price cap on Russian oil. OPEC+, which comprises the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia, angered the US and other western nations in October when it agreed to cut output by 2m barrels a day (bpd), about 2% of world demand, from November until the end of 2023. Washington accused the group and one of its leaders, Saudi Arabia, of siding with Russia despite Moscows war in Ukraine. OPEC+ argued it had cut output because of a weaker economic outlook. Oil prices have declined since October due to slower Chinese and global growth and higher interest rates. On Friday, G7 nations and Australia agreed a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil in a move to deprive Vladimir Putin of revenue while keeping Russian oil flowing to global markets. Moscow said it would not sell its oil under the cap and was analysing how to respond.\n\nUpdated at 07.27 EST",

                "cc_text": "A year ago, political, corporate and market leaders across the globe contemplated what the buildup of Russian forces along Ukraines borders would portend.\n\nWhile the U.S. administration and intelligence community warned that a Russian invasion was likely, many corporate leaders and market participants were nevertheless taken by surprise when it occurred. Shaken by yet another seemingly low-probability risk made manifest, major economic actors attempted to get ahead of the next crisis, with many concerned that the erosion of the sanctity of international borders meant an invasion of Taiwan could be next.\n\nThat risk remains highly unlikely in the near-term, and it should not distract from the risks still emanating from the war in Ukraine, such as dislocations in energy and other commodities markets and fiscal and political risks in Europe. The trajectory in Sino-American relations pertains not just to territorial and sovereign disputes, but the access to and control over the critical products and resources of our time: semiconductors and the refined metals, minerals and elements required for the sustainable-energy transition, in particular.\n\nIn the pages that follow, our team of analysts highlight what they are tracking as we head toward 2023. As we contemplate the risks and opportunities that may unfold this coming year, it is worth stepping back and considering the global context. The role that the United States will play in designing, championing and perpetuating the evolving global system, the uncertainties of a rising, but perhaps not inexorable China, the risks of an energy transition devoid of centralized design or leadership and the disruption of technologies impacts on the very nature of societal/governmental relations are in flux now.\n\nThe U.S. is being challenged as the economic and strategic hegemon, the existential threat of climate change is looming and the nature of the power of the state is evolving. A clear-eyed assessment of the global operating environment has never been more critical. We can start by remembering that the incentives for political actors to take actions against their perceived economic interests should not be underestimated whether they be super-empowered, autocratic leaders or voters in the polling booth.\n\nThis outlook represents our first look at whats to come in 2023. We will continue to monitor, analyze and update you daily, as we have since 2013.\n\nAfrica\n\nNigeria A Race Like No Other\n\nWith just under three months to go before Nigerias 25 February/11 March 2023 general elections, none of the three main presidential contenders has taken a clear lead on his rivals. The outcome will likely come down to the wire and possibly result in the first run-off since 1999.\n\nBola Ahmed Tinubu, the candidate of the governing All Progressive Congress (APC) party, should ordinarily be able to rely on his partys incumbency for a significant advantage at this point. However, declining support for the APC, the partys decision to field two Muslims as running mates (in a country with strong sensitivities around religion and regional identities), allegations of a drug dealing past and concerns about his health are all denting Tinubus personal appeal.\n\nIn any other election cycle, these conditions would likely set the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, on a path to victory. Yet, the former vice president and two-time battle-tested presidential contender is far from guaranteed victory given the emergence of a \"third-force\" in the form of Labour Party (LP)s Peter Obi, which has set the scene for a highly contested race.\n\nOne thing is clear: this election cycle is like no other. This means that historical voting patterns cannot be relied upon to provide accurate clues regarding the possible outcomes of next years presidential race. A three-horse race, the existence of an unprecedented combination of individuals as running mates and a surge in new young voters will mean that historical voting maps are likely to be redrawn.\n\nSouth Africa Conference May Not Deliver Upsides\n\nWith President Cyril Ramaphosa nearly unseated by a report into the Phala Phala scandal in early December 2022, the outcomes of the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference even if Ramaphosa were to win over his rivals, including Zweli Mkhize and possibly Paul Mashatile will likely dash hopes that South Africas president might be able to consolidate his administration via a significant cabinet reshuffle and focus firmly on delivering reforms. After all, the ANCs problems are structural, the governments decision-making culture is slow and crisis-driven, and Phala Phala and other scandals will continue to loom over the administration in 2023, eroding Ramaphosas authority and political standing even if he clings on. This suggests that the administration will be characterized more by drift than determination.\n\nAt the same time, the ANC faces a fast-approaching electoral reckoning, namely the hitherto unprecedented risk of losing its parliamentary majority in the 2024 elections. A minor drop in electoral support to just below 50% should be manageable for the ANC, but any scenario in which the partys support drops more decisively towards 40% would trigger a frantic scramble that could throw up various troubling, unstable coalition scenarios. Such possibilities will feed into policymaking in 2023, all while the government tries to contain public finance strain and the continuing energy crisis.\n\nDebt Doldrums\n\nConcerns are rising about a possible wave of sovereign defaults across Africa as many economies are facing the triple whammy effects of a weakening economic recovery, rising food and energy prices and already-high public debt. The IMF has warned that \"regional debt is approaching levels last seen before the impact of the HIPC initiative\" while the UNDPs \"Avoiding Too Little Too Late on International Debt Relief\" report deems that 25 African countries face severe debt strains, including the DRC, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique and Zambia. Ghana will see particular market scrutiny as the government embarks on debt restructuring in 2023.\n\nA consensus is building around the need for comprehensive debt relief, including for middle -income countries. Yet the existence of a wide range of creditors multilateral development banks, the Paris Club, China, India, Russia and myriad commercial lenders will make for complicated negotiations and slow progress. The G20 Bali summit suggested a continued focus on the voluntary redistribution of USD 100bn worth of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to the countries in greatest need, as well as a reliance on the international financial institutions (IFIs) as the prime channels for financial first aid.\n\nFor now, the main tool remains the G20s Common Framework for debt restructuring. Zambia is one of three testcases, and negotiations there may set a crucial precedent for how Beijing coordinates with Paris Club creditors. As CR restructurings drag on, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has called for a \"debt service standstill during negotiations\" as well as \"clear and timebound processes that foster confidence and facilitate implementation, including participation of private creditors.\"\n\nDebt vulnerabilities increasingly tie in with the climate crisis given countries deepening exposure to climate-driven natural disasters, exemplified by record floods in Nigeria and South Africa, and severe drought in the Horn of Africa in 2022. COP27s in-principle agreement on a loss and damage fund has been hailed as a major breakthrough after nearly three decades of lobbying. However, the key parameters how the fund will operate, who will finance it and who will be eligible for funding are yet to be negotiated. A lower-hanging fruit may be reforms of IFIs to provide financing to developing economies for climate change mitigation or extreme weather events and increasing the reliance on the IMFs new Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST).\n\nAsia\n\nChina Re-focusing on Growth, Stabilizing Foreign Relations\n\nAfter a year dominated by political jockeying ahead of the 20th Party Congress and the struggle to maintain the zero-Covid policy, China will re-focus on economic growth in 2023. The combination of the zero-Covid policy and a cratering housing market dragged GDP growth in 2022 far below the official target of 5.5%, but policy paralysis ahead of the Party Congress appeared to prevent aggressive action in response. Following the Party Congress, however, policymakers unveiled a series of measures to support the property market, while street protests pushed them to accelerate the timeline for exiting zero-Covid.\n\nMarkets are cheering the long-awaited exit from \"dynamic zero,\" but the transition is likely to be bumpy. Due to the countrys success in containing the virus, Chinas population lacks herd immunity, so the ongoing shift to a coexistence policy is prompting a surge in cases that threatens to overwhelm the healthcare system.\n\nOn foreign policy, Xi has restarted foreign travel and hosted a series of foreign leaders in Beijing. Meanwhile, Xi moved to distance himself modestly from Russias war in Ukraine by condemning Moscows threat to use nuclear weapons. A meeting between Xi and U.S. President Joe Biden appeared to signal both sides intention to prevent further worsening of bilateral relations. Tensions over Taiwan will continue to simmer, but both Washington and Beijing have committed to maintaining communication, including between their two militaries, to prevent any unplanned escalations that could lead to crisis.\n\nA Busy Year for Election Politics in Southeast Asia\n\nOnly Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to hold elections in 2023, but the ripple effects around the recent Malaysian elections and the upcoming 2024 presidential elections in Indonesia will also have significant effects on these countries respective political outlooks. The risk is highest in Thailand, where political allies of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra appear set to make a major comeback in elections that must take place by May 2023 at the latest. His daughter, Paetongtarn, is polling the highest among likely candidates to be the next PM, but could be frustrated by the military-appointed senate a dynamic that raises the prospect of social unrest and political gridlock. In Cambodia, Hun Sen may stand down after 36 years in power to be replaced by his western-educated son Hun Manet, who may present a more palatable face for the countrys politics.\n\nIndonesia could be the biggest focus. Elections are in 2024, but the nomination of presidential candidates will occur in October 2023. If the moderate Central Java governor Ganjar Pranowos presidential prospects flounder, then Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto and former Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan could emerge as favorites, increasing perceptions of a turn towards nationalism and sectarianism in the regions largest economy, which generated substantial optimism in 2022. Malaysia will also continue to suffer the aftereffects of its recent election. With the fragmented outcome of the vote and internal wrangling among the parties, long-term political stability will remain elusive, compounded by the perception that voters have turned towards socially conservative parties.\n\nDismal Poll Numbers in Japan and South Korea\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida will begin 2023 with chronically low poll numbers, with voters irked by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)s long-concealed ties to the controversial Unification Church and rising cost-of-living pressures. A forthcoming USD 200bn package of economic countermeasures should help ease the latter. Japan is set to begin a major upshift in defense expenditure and capabilities in response to Chinas growing military assertiveness and may hike corporate taxes in FY2024 to fund it. Before April, Kishida must also choose the next Bank of Japan governor, with a medium-term reversal of outgoing Haruhiko Kurodas decade-long ultra-loose monetary policy stance looking possible. If Kishida gets a boost in the polls from hosting the G7 summit in his hometown Hiroshima in May, he could call a snap general election in the summer to reset his administrations fortunes.\n\nSouth Koreas president Yoon Suk-yeol is also beset by dismal poll numbers and a challenging economic environment in addition to the fallout from the Itaewon Halloween tragedy. These factors will impede his ability to advance a meaningful domestic policy agenda through the opposition-controlled National Assembly in 2023. On foreign policy, Seoul will increase cooperation with the U.S. on defense and economic security matters, though there will be tough choices around export controls and supply chainsparticularly regarding semiconductors in the context of the Biden administrations new export control regime and the Chip 4 alliance. Seoul is also likely to seek a deal with Tokyo on the wartime forced labor issue.\n\nIn North Korea, Pyongyang will continue testing missiles and even nuclear weapons until it reaches its goals for technological development, further catalyzing an arms race on the peninsula. Seoul, Washington and Tokyo are set to increase cooperation in response.\n\nIn Focus: Global Energy\n\nGeopolitical Tensions Underpin Structural Shifts in Global Commodities Markets\n\nDevelopments in recent years have exposed and expedited dramatic transformations already underway in global commodities markets, many of which are reinforced by geopolitical developments and tensions.\n\nWhether it was the shift to Europe from Asia as the global LNG price-setter in response to the Ukraine war, the preliminary establishment of a \"loss and damages\" climate reparations fund at COP27 in response to significant and growing climate disasters, or the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act targeting rapid deployment of new U.S.-centric clean energy supply chains to reduce Chinese influence, events in 2022 triggered responses that will set the pace for substantial changes and tensions in global energy markets, with a few trends looking to become significantly more pronounced in 2023.\n\nVolatility Will Instigate Anticompetitive Oil and Gas Market Responses\n\nWith volatility and uncertainty continuing to define oil and gas markets in 2023, buyer/supplier relationships and trade policies will remain in the spotlight with a growing risk of market interference and anticompetitive practices.\n\nThis could translate into more of the same in the standoff between OPEC+ looking to influence the market through output adjustments and the U.S. and other markets using strategic reserves and other tools to try to counter these market forces to tackle high prices. These dynamics risk entrenching some of these buyer/supplier disputes in a way that could reinforce higher prices and supply disruptions in fossil fuel markets. These tensions could also carry through to assessments of U.S.-Middle East relations, causing some frictions while also pointing to the need for discipline in differentiating between energy market and global security priorities.\n\nIn addition, these trends could prompt more attempts by buyer markets to introduce additional market management measures. For example, the EUs proposed gas price cap risks unnatural interference in markets that could have an array of consequences for the global gas trade if eventually introduced in some form.\n\nMinerals and Metals Supply Chains Will Emerge as a 2023 Priority (and Beyond)\n\nCompetition to secure critical mineral supply chains, which will underpin the global energy transition, will likely be the most heated issue intersecting energy markets and geopolitics in 2023 and beyond.\n\nWhile a rocky post-pandemic recovery period and the ripple effects of Russias war in Ukraine prioritized energy security over energy transitions, the push for emissions reductions and a cleaner energy future will pick up pace in the new year, supporting demand for key metals and critical minerals. Although bearish price pressures could continue to impact the metals and minerals market in the year ahead, emerging policy environments strengthening clean energy initiatives and supply chains, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, will lend demand and price support in the long term.\n\nThe U.S. and EU are starting to supplant China as the new drivers of metals demand, as consumption growth is set to surge in support of each markets energy transition and electrification agendas and as the Chinese market experiences some headwinds. The U.S. is set to add significant additional wind, solar and energy storage capacity over the next few years under the Inflation Reduction Act, global electric vehicle demand is estimated to increase by some 30% annually over the next few years and the European Union is looking to launch the European Raw Materials Fund, targeting up to EUR 150bn in public and private investments by early 2023.\n\nThese trends will reinforce competition and demand for copper, lithium, cobalt and nickel, among others, with shortages starting to emerge as a real and imminent risk. The rush to secure these alternative metals and minerals and corresponding supply chains could not only exacerbate escalating U.S.-China tensions, but also could generate transatlantic frictions in U.S.-EU relations. Both sides will inspect potential discrimination or WTO violations inherent in the very policies intended to support local economies and manufacturers and to\n\nreduce perceived energy security risks associated with an overdependence on the Chinese supply.\n\nExpect U.S. and EU tensions over China and transatlantic trade to remain a crucial part of the 2023 critical minerals and metals debate. Accompanying policy and investment decisions will influence these markets directly and likely spill into proxy markets, impacting investments and geopolitical dynamics with countries across Africa, Latin America and beyond.\n\nEurope\n\nHow (Not) to End the War in Ukraine\n\nAs Russias war in Ukraine extends into 2023, its trajectory will continue to be shaped by multiple interrelated factors on both sides, including military capabilities, political and public determination to continue fighting, as well as the availability of financial and economic resources. While none of these factors alone is sufficient to bring about a victory, a failure to sustain any of them could force either side into painful concessions and strategic setbacks.\n\nFollowing a number of humiliating defeats on the battlefield in autumn, the Russian side is intensifying calls for negotiations. Such calls are backed by devastating missile strikes on Ukraine and threatening rhetoric towards the West. These tactics seek to convince Kyiv and its allies that the risk of continuing the war is too high for all sides. This raises the question of whether any meaningful negotiations are possible with the Putin regime openly questioning Ukraines sovereignty and claiming to be in an existential struggle with the West. Even if the answer was \"yes,\" the opposing strategic objectives on both sides make a lasting ceasefire, let alone any sustainable resolution to the conflict, very unlikely, at least as long as Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky remain in power.\n\nPerhaps the most important factor to determine the outcome of the war will be the extent of continued international support for Ukraine. This entails not only military, macro-financial and humanitarian assistance, but also political backing to seek an agreement that would be acceptable to Ukraine. Any attempts by the West to negotiate a deal with Moscow over Kyivs head or to push Zelensky into a compromise lacking domestic Ukrainian backing would be corrosive to the perceived credibility of the Western alliance.\n\nIncumbents Fight for Survival\n\nElectoral politics will require monitoring, as ruling parties fight for re-election in Estonia, Greece, Turkey, Poland and Spain. In the Baltic country, the Reform Party is expected to prevail in the poll in March, although it will face stiff competition from the right-wing Conservative Peoples Party of Estonia. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis from the center-right New Democracy (ND) is likely to get re-elected in Greece despite the ongoing spyware scandal. However, given the countrys electoral system, two consecutive polls in May and June will likely be necessary for ND to obtain the necessary parliamentary majority.\n\nIn Turkey, incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdoan will probably secure re-election in the June presidential poll despite a challenging economic context. At the same time, his Justice and Development Party (AKP) is unlikely to obtain a parliamentary majority in the concurrent legislative polls, but will still be able to form a coalition with the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). In Poland, the ruling United Right bloc faces much tougher competition in the legislative election that will be held in October, with opposition parties still debating whether to form an alliance. At this stage, the opposition has a slightly better chance of obtaining a parliamentary majority and forming a government.\n\nAnother incumbent who might have a hard time getting re-elected is Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, given the strong momentum of the opposition center-right Peoples Party (PP) in the polls. However, whether the PP can obtain a convincing victory in the legislative election likely to be held in November or December will depend on its ability to keep intra-party divisions at bay. The regional and municipal elections in May will provide a good signpost of each partys electoral strength. Finally, no legislative elections are planned in France, but President Emmanuel Macron could dissolve the National Assembly if the government cannot get its reforms passed in parliament.\n\nNo More Anarchy in the UK?\n\nAfter a year with three prime ministers, the Conservatives will try to display stability, preparing the ground for the general election expected in 2024. The immediate factor to watch is how grave the recession will turn out to be. Following Liz Trusss disastrous stint at 10 Downing Street, a prolonged downturn might make it even harder for PM Rishi Sunak and his Conservatives to win back their trademark perception of economic competence.\n\nThe budget announced late in 2022 was a first step in that direction, even if it made few tough choices, with major spending cuts envisaged only after the election. Rather, the Tories have returned to kicking the can down the road, which has long been the Conservative approach to fiscal policy, except for Trusss brief episode of recklessness.\n\nOver recent years, short-term justifications for delaying fiscal consolidation were provided by the pandemic and Russias war on Ukraine. However, the underlying political issue is that the Conservatives are still struggling to decide what the role of the state should be, while having since Brexit attracted new voter segments that depend on expanding rather than cutting public services.\n\nThe market turmoil of 2022 may have shielded Sunak from an immediate backlash from within his own party against tax hikes. Delaying the most difficult choices beyond the next election might only increase the burden on Sir Keir Starmer in case of a Labour win. In the meantime, the key signpost to watch is how quickly internal opposition will gain pace within the Conservative Party.\n\nLatin America\n\nTest of Resilience\n\n2023 will be challenging for Latin America. The region faces a major fall-off in growth, and inflation will take time to moderate. Growth in the two major markets Brazil and Mexico will be limp, though not as weak as in Chile and Colombia. That will create delivery headaches for leftist governments that promised voters so much. Perus long-running political crisis may not abate significantly in 2023 even following Pedro Castillos ouster in late 2022, while polarization is also likely to remain high in Bolivia.\n\nThe biggest test for institutional resilience in 2023 may center on Mexico and Central America. On the isthmus, democratic rules and norms have already been dismantled at speed by El Salvadors Nayib Bukele, while Nicaragua has become a full-blown dictatorship. Guatemalas June 2023 elections could see Yuri Rios, an authoritarian admirer, winning power. In Mexico, the extent of democratic backsliding is less pronounced, but President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO)s objective of securing hegemony for his National Regeneration Movement (Morena) will see continuing political battles over the electoral system.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. willingness and ability to counter democratic backsliding will continue to be limited by domestic pressures to stem migration, as well as more pressing priorities beyond Latin America. At the same time, left-leaning governments will try to re-forge regional alliances that exclude the U.S., while continuing to embrace Chinese investment, trade and finance.\n\nBrazil Under Lula\n\nThe immediate challenge for the incoming administration of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who takes office in January 2023, will be the handling of the economy. Unlike his two previous mandates, when he inherited a balanced fiscal situation and benefitted from a commodity super cycle that favored Brazilian exports to China, Lula will face a challenging economic environment, characterized by a virtually inexistent fiscal space to promote growth or attend to significant social demands. Interest rates will likely remain in double digits in Lulas first year in power.\n\nParties aligned with the outgoing Jair Bolsonaro won congressional majorities. However, all these parties belong to the \"Big Center,\" which is notorious for negotiating itself into an alliance with the government in power. It is therefore likely that Lula manages to put together a strong alliance in congress that will comprise parties from the Left and the Big-Center, in addition to \"democratic center\" parties that formed a coalition to support his election. There will be compromises on sensitive issues such as the \"secret budget,\" which allows parliamentarians access to public funds in the absence of any transparency obligation on their allocation.\n\nEnvironmental policy under Lula will provide the greatest contrast to the Bolsonaro administration. Lula should follow through on his promises and tackle deforestation and strengthen environmental institutions that were virtually dismantled under the previous government. Initial agribusiness opposition to Lula should evolve into a collaborative partnership with a view to ensuring restriction-free trade with Brazils main trading partners.\n\nOn foreign policy, Brazil is expected to \"return\" to the concert of nations under Lula, as exemplified by his participation in COP27. It is less likely this time that Lula will favor political alliances with so-called Bolivarian countries i.e., countries with left-wing populist governments such as Venezuela or Nicaragua. Lula will seek out major OECD countries early in his administration, including the U.S., but should also pursue a normalization of bilateral relations with China following a difficult period under Bolsonaro.\n\nThe Electoral Horizon\n\nThe regions most important election will take place in Argentina in October. Economic difficulties, led by stubbornly high inflation, make it highly likely that the governing Peronists will lose the presidency. It is difficult to see what formula Cristina Fernandez (CFK) can conjure to retain the levers of power. Even so, the main opposition coalition is beset by internal divisions and must manage what could be a bruising primary to settle on a candidate, or risk fortifying the anti-establishment far-right. A defeat for Peronism would debunk the notion that Latin America is in the grip of a \"pink tide\" and instead reinforce the sense that the region is experiencing a reaction against incumbency more than a leftward shift.\n\nOther votes across the region may not garner so much attention but will be important markers of political currents. Mexico holds a pair of state elections one in the economic powerhouse state of Mexico that represent the curtain-raiser for the 2024 presidential elections. 2023 will also see the competition to succeed AMLO intensify. In Venezuela, a primary process to select an opposition presidential candidate will also take place over 2023. Meanwhile, Chile could see a vote for a fresh constituent assembly and/or a referendum to ratify or reject a(nother) draft constitution, meaning constitutional uncertainty will drag on into a fifth year. Finally, regional and local elections in Ecuador and Colombia will provide tests for governments that are respectively struggling and new.\n\nIn Focus: Global Tech\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. has pursued policy measures aimed at containing Chinas technological ascendancy. The export controls announced in October signal an unprecedented escalation by marking the first time that blanket restrictions were applied on entire product categories rather than targeting specific Chinese buyers, entities or government institutions. Vis--vis tiered foreign direct production rules that restrict the sale of U.S.-origin technology components, the controls not only curb the sales of U.S.-based semiconductors and semi-equipment firms, but they also position the U.S. to dictate who non-U.S. companies sell to, regardless of where production takes place.\n\nThe immediate business implication is the anticipated lost revenue for firms with significant exposure to Chinese customers and chipmakers. Approximately 15% of revenues of the major U.S.-based equipment suppliers are estimated to be at risk as a result of these controls. Major non-U.S. suppliers of allied countries are also expected to take a hit, such as Japan-based Tokyo Electron, which derives 25% of its sales from China, while Netherlands-based ASML expects less material losses, but an indirect impact nonetheless. In 2023, companies could develop workarounds to continue sales to China, whether by selling through foreign subsidiaries or designing out U.S.-origin components from their technologies, which could accelerate the technological and economic decoupling of China and the West.\n\nMore Controls? More Fragmentation?\n\nIf firms choose the \"design-out\" option, the sector may see more firms consider dual-track manufacturing or multiple tech stacks. As governments increase regulations at the manufacturing and input sales level, this may increase the likelihood of technology firms building multiple configurations of their technologies to maintain consumer bases while adhering to government policies. Technology fragmentation has already been noted with the \"splinternet,\" which is a product of varying government regulations on digital content, social media and access to technology. These fragmentations may now also be seen at the product manufacturing level.\n\nWhile this is not something that will happen overnight, we are seeing firms such as Nvidia find ways to sell their products to Chinese markets while following U.S. policies. Dual-track manufacturing of technologies can have serious implications for the future of global technology. For one, dual-track manufacturing is a costly and labor-intensive option and consumers may find product costs increasing to reflect this. Second, this fragmentation can increase the chances of incompatibilities and less secure products. It can also create challenges for product useability. Firms opting for multiple tech stacks will need to ensure that differing product specifications have a limited impact on end users. Third, having multiple tech stacks can limit the efficacy of global standards for technology, cross-border data usage and user consent. Finally, fragmented technologies can limit innovation, openness and growth in the technology sector. In the coming year, companies will have to spend more time finding ways to address regulatory hurdles rather than focusing on encouraging innovation.\n\nWill the U.S. Go it Alone\n\nWashington had hoped for these export controls to be issued in conjunction with European and Asian allies to send a unified message about global technology decision-making. However, U.S. allies, namely the EU, have not yet decided on a stance since the bloc is strongly divided regarding how to deal with Beijing. For instance, countries such as Germany and Hungary want to take a less confrontational approach, given existing trade relations and a cloudy economic outlook.\n\nU.S. officials are seeking a trilateral deal with the Netherlands and Japan to enhance broader efforts to curtail the Chinese chip industrys ability to grow. Decisions about these issues may be expected in 2023. At the same time, the big powers will remain committed to their strategy of boosting their domestic chip production capabilities, with the EU expected to approve its Chips Act in the first half of next year.\n\nMajor Signposts for 2023\n\nOn the political side, it will be important to watch how partners proceed on the topic. Japan and the Netherlands have joined the U.S. in principle, but their level of partnership is yet to be detailed. While the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council (TTC) may not address this before year-end, it will become a topic of discussion for the TTC export controls working group in 2023. In Japan, even with a tilt towards Washington, officials and business stakeholders may try to rein in any desire for a complete decoupling from Beijing.\n\nOn the technology side, an issue to watch is the announcements of new production facilities in other countries. Firms will have to monitor new policies and regulations that could further complicate their supply chains, product designs and sales strategies. Increased due diligence, as well as the potential for decreased sales, will continue to be a concern for firms who are already grappling with reduced revenues. 2023 may bring forth fragmentation of technology if public and private sector decision-makers are unable to balance geopolitical and technological priorities.\n\nMiddle East & North Africa\n\nSaudi Arabia's Transformation Continues\n\nSaudi Arabia is full of swagger with the run-up in energy prices. Commercial interest in the Kingdom is increasing, and even some of the countrys more quixotic efforts are garnering serious attention. The Biden visit to Jeddah in July and the decision to extend sovereign immunity to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November reinforced the conclusion that the Kingdom is too important to ignore and too central to the global economy to isolate.\n\nThe opportunities in Saudi Arabia arise from the leaderships appetite for disruption, driven by an awareness that the energy transition is looming. Saudi Arabia has about a two-decade window to transform its economy, and in particular its private sector workforce, from a low-wage, high-productivity, expatriate-heavy population into one reliant on the productivity of Saudis. Maintaining discipline in the face of windfall profits hasnt worked before, but Saudi Arabia has new management.\n\nIn the near term, the risks are far more on the side of ill-considered adventures than public backlash. Still, Saudi Arabias transformation process is built around one man, which creates key person risk.\n\nToughened Economic Straits for Egypt\n\nEgypt has its own set of risks. The Ukraine war wreaked havoc on government budgets and the government had to hit pause on debt-fueled development and disruption that sometimes seemed every bit as ambitious as Saudi Arabias. The IMF forced Egypt into a major devaluation of the pound in October that rescued the countrys foreign reserves, but will increase the cost of servicing dollar-denominated debt and fuel inflation.\n\nExternal support will come on harder terms now; Gulf countries that had previously made deposits with the Egyptian central bank are now insisting on equity in Egyptian businesses. President Sisi pleaded for leniency from international lenders, arguing that the population is a tinderbox, but he got little sympathy. Lenders have tired of supporting the government in general, and the military in particular, as it embarked on unsustainable economic projects.\n\nThe toughened economic straits will challenge Sisi politically, both among the elites and the public, and they will tarnish the image he has put forth as Egypts savior.\n\nProtests in Iran and Beyond?\n\nA rising protest movement in Iran is not yet a threat to the government. Still, economic conditions are deteriorating, and the government is once again pursuing nuclear brinkmanship to force Western powers to engage with it.\n\nAyatollah Khamenei, who has been in office for 33 years, is 83 and reportedly ailing. We are beginning to see signs that battle lines are being drawn for succession. There are a wide variety of possible outcomes, among them the succession of his son and the rising authority of the revolutionary guard at the expense of the clerical establishment.\n\nEven if Khamenei remains in office, rising internal pressure increases the likelihood of Iran doing something disruptive in a bid to increase its leverage over outside powers or distract the domestic population. Irans skillful exploitation of deniable activities gives it potential reach throughout the Middle East.\n\nBeyond Iran, the brake on instability in the wider MENA region remains the Arab Spring, which populations widely regard to have produced no lasting benefit. Yet, the grievances of hundreds of millions of Arabs are likely to increase this year. The key question to watch is whether it will matter.",

Under this arrangement, retailers keep the difference between wholesale prices and pump prices as costs fall back.\n\n\"Between 2017 and 2021, the difference between the price retailers paid for fuel and the pump price (the \"fuel margin\") rose by the equivalent of 2-3p a litre on diesel and 3-4p a litre on petrol,\" the CMA found.\n\nThe watchdog said the rise could be a result of \"the extreme volatility of prices and supply in 2022\" but pledged to \"investigate further.\"\n\nBrent crude oil hit highs of more than $125 per barrel in March in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putins war and reached similar prices in June. Since then prices have declined and oils most recent value was closer to $80.\n\nPrices for petrol reached record highs of almost 200 pence per litre over summer but have since fallen back, recently falling below 160 pence per litre.\n\nDiesel drivers have suffered more enduring rises, the CMA said. The gap between the two fuels is the largest ever recorded, with a 24 pence premium for diesel.\n\nMuch of this is down to Western Europes reliance on diesel imports from Russia, which have been disrupted by Moscows attack on Ukraine.\n\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: \"While it's encouraging the CMA has found evidence of 'rocket and feather' pricing taking place this year, we believe there was clear evidence of it happening this time last year and in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\"Volatility has unquestionably been an issue in fuel pricing since Russia invaded Ukraine, but when wholesale prices trend down for weeks at a time drivers should see pump prices do the same at a similar rate.\n\n\"Unfortunately, our data shows that this is not often the case.\"\n\nThe CMA also found evidence that areas with fewer petrol stations, and thus less competition, had higher fuel prices, particularly in areas with no supermarket-owned pumps.\n\nSupermarkets often sell fuel on smaller margins than dedicated petrol station networks in order to lure shoppers to their stores.\n\nInterim CMA Chief Executive Sarah Cardell said: \"It has been a terrible year for drivers, with filling up a vehicle now a moment of dread for many.\n\n\"The disruption of imports from Russia means that diesel drivers, in particular, are paying a substantial premium because of the invasion of Ukraine. A weaker pound is contributing to higher prices across the board too.\"\n\nHigher energy costs have also contributed to rising petrol and diesel prices at the pump as driving up oil refining and distribution costs rise.",

REUTERS/Mehmet Emin Caliskan Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nLONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Turkey's maritime authority said on Thursday it would continue to block the passage of oil tankers that don't carry appropriate insurance letters, adding that insurance checks on ships in its waters were a \"routine procedure\".\n\nThe logjam is creating growing unease in oil and tanker markets and comes as the G7 and European Union introduce a price cap on Russian oil.\n\nMillions of barrels of oil per day move south from Russian ports through Turkey's Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits into the Mediterranean.\n\nHere are key facts about the issue.\n\nShips typically have protection & indemnity (P&I) insurance, which covers third party liability claims including environmental damage and injury. Separate hull and machinery (H&M) policies cover vessels against physical damage.\n\nTurkish authorities introduced new requirements, which came into effect at the beginning of December, in which every ship must have P&I insurance cover in place for all circumstances when sailing through Turkish waters or when calling at ports.\n\nA circular issued by Turkey's Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure on Nov. 16 and seen by Reuters said it was \"necessary to confirm that P&I insurances are still valid and inclusive during the passage of cargo ships, especially crude oil products ... through the Turkish Straits\".\n\nCiting the potentially catastrophic of impact of any accident, it added: \"It was considered that it would be the most cost-effective and reasonable solution to receive an additional confirmation letter that the ship would still be covered by the valid P&I insurance during this voyage.\"\n\nThe new regulations came into effect before a $60 per barrel price cap was imposed on Russian seaborne crude on Dec. 5. read more\n\nWith that mechanism, Western insurers are required to retain proof that Russian oil covered is sold at or below that price. The industry has a 45-day transition period and a 90-day grace period if the G7 changes the price cap at a later date.\n\nShip insurers say the Turkish requirements would mean continuing to provide cover, and thereby pay for any losses, even in the event that a ship is found to be in breach of Western sanctions.\n\nThe top tier of P&I insurers, which numbers 13 clubs, covers about 90% of the world ocean-going tonnage and are represented by the International Group association.\n\nThe International Group, which has held discussions with Turkish authorities, has assessed that member clubs should not issue such a letter, P&I clubs said this week in advisory notes.\n\n\"Issuing a confirmatory letter under these circumstances would expose the Club to a breach of sanctions under EU, UK and US law and as such the Clubs cannot comply with the Turkish Authority's request,\" ship insurer UK P&I Club said in an advisory.\n\nSince the regulations came into effect, one tanker covered by Russian insurer Ingosstrakh was able to sail after a letter was submitted. read more\n\nThe International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) association, which represents over 80% of the world's merchant fleet, said it hoped for a swift resolution of the issue.\n\n\"We're aware that high-level discussions are underway to provide clarity on Turkish government requirements that crude tankers entering or transiting Turkish waters must provide assurance from the owner's insurers that cover will remain, even in the event of a breach of sanctions,\" an ICS spokesperson said.\n\n\"The notice goes beyond usual confirmations of cover, causing delay to vessels while clarity is sought on the scope of the new requirements.\"\n\nThe Turkish Straits, which include Istanbul's Bosphorus and the Dardanelles waterways, divide Asia from Europe.\n\nThe Bosphorus, a 17-mile waterway that connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and eventually to the Mediterranean Sea, is one of the world's most important choke points for the maritime transit of oil.\n\nAccording to analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration in 2017, over 3% of global supply or 3 million barrels per day, mainly from Russia and the Caspian Sea, passed through the Bosphorus.\n\nThe 40-mile Dardanelles strait separately connects the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas.\n\nThe number of tankers waiting in the Black Sea to cross the Bosphorus strait on the way to the Mediterranean Sea rose to 19 from 16 earlier on Thursday, the Tribeca shipping agency said.\n\nWith 9 others waiting at the Dardanelles, there were a total of 28 tankers waiting, the agency said. read more\n\nReporting by Jonathan Saul, additional reporting by Noah Browning\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "A price cap on Russian crude oil in response to the countrys invasion and ongoing war in Ukraine will go into effect on December 5. The price cap is an effort to reduce Russias oil revenues while maintaining adequate supplies of crude on the global energy market.\n\nIn this second installment of a two-part Q&A on the price cap,[1] Edward Fishman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy, answers questions about how one can evaluate whether the policy is successful and what alternatives exist if it fails.\n\nWhat would success for the price cap look like?\n\nFor the policy to be judged a success, it will need to significantly cut Russias oil revenues. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Russia has been selling its oil at big discountsaround $20 or $30 below the Brent benchmark price.[2] At the very least, the price cap should lock in these discounts. The G7 will set the cap at a fixed price as opposed to a moving discount to Brent, but it reserves the right to alter its level at any time.\n\nIdeally, the price cap should require Russia to sell its oil with even steeper discounts than already exist on the marketplace. The United States has said that it plans to keep the price cap above Russias marginal cost of production, which the Russian government assesses at roughly $40 per barrel.[3] (Independent analysts believe Russias marginal cost of production may be much lower.[4]) The closer the cap pushes the price of Russian oil to $40 per barrel or even below that threshold, the more successful it will be, as it will signal that Putin is generating minimal profits from oil sales.\n\nAt the same time, to be judged a success, the price cap must not inadvertently cause a spike in global oil prices. How might that happen? With US sanctions, overcompliance is the norm. Instead of abiding by American sanctions regulations precisely, companies often stay well clear of the line. In the case of the price cap, overcompliance would look like traders, insurers, or shipping firms refusing to deal with Russian oil even if its sold for a price below the cap. The result could be a major drop in the supply of Russian oil available on the global market, which could increase prices for everyone. (Of course, if the supply of Russian oil is squeezed but global energy prices do not increase, that would not be a problem from the perspective of the G7.) Fears of overcompliance explain why senior US officials have made compliance expectations relatively simple[5] and have repeatedly downplayed the threat of American penalties when companies accidentally violate the policy.\n\nWhat would failure look like?\n\nThere are many ways the price cap could fail. For starters, if the price cap does not meaningfully reduce Russias oil revenues, it would be fair to question why the United States and other members of the G7 invested so much time and effort into the policy. While it may be tempting to keep the cap conservativefor instance, by maintaining it roughly in line with the current market price for Russian oildoing so would defeat the purpose of the policy.\n\nAnother way the cap could fail would be for buyers of Russian oil, including firms in China and India, to find full-scale supply chains for Russian oil that dont involve the G7 service providers that must adhere to the price cap. If Russia can sell all its oil without using any G7 services (including trading, commodities brokering, financing, shipping, insurance, flagging, and customs brokering), the cap will not exert any substantial pressure on Russias oil revenues. US officials have emphasized that Russia is free to sell oil without using any G7 services, but its doing so wouldnt represent policy success. On the contrary, it would demonstrate that a \"service providers cartel,\" as the G7 effort might be considered (see Part 1 of the Q&A), was ill-founded in the first place.\n\nA third way the cap could fail would be widespread evasion and undercompliance. If buyers of Russian oil find it simple to continue to use G7 services while surreptitiously paying Russia prices that exceed the cap, the policy will not just fail to cut Russias revenues, it will also damage the reputation of US sanctions. This is what happened in the 1990s when the UN set up the \"oil-for-food\" program with Iraq, which was riddled with corruption.[6] The Biden administration seems to fear overcompliance more than undercompliance. But if this expectation proves incorrect, Washington must be prepared to vigorously enforce the cap with penalties.\n\nCould Putin respond by just cutting off oil sales?\n\nYes, Putin himself could remove oil supplies from the global marketplace by shutting in large quantities of Russian oil. Putin is clearly not opposed to using energy as a weapon: he has cut gas supplies to the EU in recent months, a policy that has put pressure on both Europe and Russia.[7] With oil, however, Russias biggest customers are not in Europe but rather in China, India, and Turkey.[8] So if Putin decided to shut in oil production, it would not only grievously harm Russias own energy sector and its state finances, it would also inflict pain on Beijing, New Delhi, and Ankaragovernments that Moscow cannot afford to anger.\n\nAnyone who attempts to forecast Kremlin policy must have a healthy degree of humility. To be sure, Putin could decide to cut oil supplies despite these obvious downsides. Yet its not clear such a decision would mark policy failure. In fact, it could even be a welcome scenario for the G7 if it proves fiscally devastating for Moscow and the hardship caused by supply cuts turns the rest of the world decisively against Russia and its aggression in Ukraine.\n\nIf the current policy fails, are there ways the G7 could restructure the price cap or pursue a different approach to cut Russias oil revenues?\n\nThis initial price cap is just one arrow the G7 has in its quiver when it comes to depriving the Kremlin of its oil riches. If the problem with the price cap is either undercompliance or the establishment of reliable supply chains that avoid the G7 entirely, the G7 can strengthen the policy by threatening secondary sanctions against any company that buys Russian oil for a price above the cap. Legislation introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) would do just that.[9]\n\nThere are other policy options that dont rely on the price cap concept at all. For instance, if oil demand falls and pressure on supply eases, the G7 could attempt to cut the volume of oil that Russia sells as opposed to reducing the price of that oil. The United States has successfully imposed such restrictions on Iran for years. Starting in 2012, Washington threatened secondary sanctions against buyers of Iranian oil unless their home countries significantly reduced their total purchases of Irans oil every six months. This policy led to sharp declines in Irans oil salesfrom roughly 2.5 million barrels per day when the policy was instituted to well below 1 million barrels of oil per day at their low point.[10]\n\nAnother option is to use financial sanctions to block Russia from enjoying unfettered access to its oil revenues. Such a policy also has a precedent in the Iran context. Later in 2012, Capitol Hill pushed for the Obama administration to require all importers of Iranian oilincluding companies in China, India, and Turkeyto reduce their purchases to zero or face secondary sanctions. The Obama administration was wary of such a move, so a compromise was reached: Instead of pushing for purchases of Iranian oil to fall to zero, it would require all of Irans oil revenues to flow into restricted accounts, where the funds could only be used for bilateral trade in nonsanctioned goods as well as humanitarian-related products.[11] The policy was a huge success, locking up more than $100 billion of Iranian oil funds in restricted bank accounts.[12] This provided Washington with its best source of leverage in nuclear talks with Tehran. Theres no good reason the G7 couldnt dust off this policy and direct it at Russia.\n\nA fourth option would be an import tariff on Russian oila policy that several influential policy analysts in Europe favored over the price cap.[13] Regardless of what the best alternative to the price cap may be, the important point here is that there are plenty of alternative policies that could cut Russias oil revenues. So if the price cap fails, members of the G7 need not throw up their hands in defeat. They canand shouldgo back to the drawing board.\n\nNotes",

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled at $73.17 a barrel, rising $2.15, or 3%.\n\nLast week, Brent and WTI fell to their lowest since December 2021 as investors worried a possible global recession could hurt oil demand.\n\nThe potential of a prolonged outage of TC Energy Corp's (TRP.TO) Canada-to-U.S. Keystone crude oil pipeline helped turn prices around.\n\n\"Keystone Pipeline repair appears to be taking longer than expected (and) upping the possibility of further stock draws at Cushing,\" said Jim Ritterbusch at Ritterbusch and Associates.\n\nTraders worried about how long it would take to clean up and restart the Keystone oil pipeline after more than 14,000 barrels of oil leaked last week, the largest U.S. crude oil spill in nearly a decade.\n\nTC Energy shut the pipeline after the spill was discovered late last Wednesday in Kansas. The company told officials in Washington County, Kansas, that they have not yet determined the cause or timeline for a restart. Officials were excavating around the 622,000 barrel-per-day Keystone line, a critical passageway for heavy Canadian crude shipped to U.S. refiners and to the Gulf Coast for export.\n\nThe outage is expected to shrink supplies at the Cushing, Oklahoma storage hub, and delivery point for benchmark U.S. crude oil futures.\n\nSeven analysts polled by Reuters estimated, on average, that overall crude inventories dropped by about 3.9 million barrels in the week to Dec. 9, a preliminary Reuters poll showed.\n\nBank of America Global research said Brent could rebound past $90 per barrel on the back of a dovish pivot in the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy and a \"successful\" economic reopening by China.\n\n\"China's reopening is definitely something the market is focused on,\" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures group.\n\nChina, the world's biggest crude oil importer, continued to loosen its strict zero-COVID policy, though streets in the capital Beijing remained quiet and many businesses stayed shut over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday, queues formed outside fever clinics in the cities of Beijing and Wuhan, where COVID first emerged three years ago.\n\n\"Oil markets will likely stay volatile in the near term amid uncertainty over the impact on Russian output from the EU's ban, headlines on China's COVID policy, and central bank movements in the U.S. and Europe,\" UBS analysts said in a note.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia could cut production and would refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes a \"stupid\" price cap on Russian exports.\n\nSaudi Arabia's energy minister also said on Sunday that price cap measures had no clear results yet.\n\nThe number of tankers waiting to pass through Istanbul's Bosphorus Strait fell on Monday, showing an easing of the recent build-up in traffic.\n\n\"The emergent EU embargo on Russian crude... may add moderate upside energy price risks in the next few months. But supply uncertainty should ease by spring 2023, after the embargo on oil products (on Feb.5) plays out,\" Deutsche Bank said in a note.\n\nAdditional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, Florence Tan and Emily Chow in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Those are: a European Union boycott of most Russian oil and a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian exports imposed by the EU and the Group of Seven democracies.\n\nIt is not yet clear how much Russian oil the two sanctions measures could take off the global market, which would tighten supply and drive up prices. The world's No. 2 oil producer has been able to reroute much, but not all, of its former Europe shipments to customers in India, China and Turkey. The impact of the price cap is also up in the air because Russia has said it could simply halt deliveries to countries that observe the limit but would likely also find ways to evade the cap for some shipments.\n\nOn the other side, oil has been trading at lower prices on fears that coronavirus outbreaks and China's strict zero-COVID restrictions would reduce demand for fuel in one of the world's major economies. Concerns about recessions in the U.S. and Europe also raise the prospect of lower demand for gasoline and other fuel made from crude.\n\nThat uncertainty is the reason the OPEC+ alliance gave in October for a slashing production by 2 million barrels per day starting in November, a cut that remains in effect. Analysts say that took less than the full amount off the market since OPEC+ members already can't meet their full production quotas.\n\nWith the global economy slowing, oil prices have been falling since summertime highs, with international benchmark Brent closing Friday at $85.42 per barrel, down from $98 a month ago. That has eased gasoline prices for drivers in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nAverage gas prices have fallen for U.S. drivers in recent days to $3.41 per gallon, according to motoring club federation AAA.\n\nTo prevent a sudden loss of Russian crude, the price cap allows shipping and insurance companies to transport Russian oil to non-Western nations at or below that threshold. Most of the globe's tanker fleet is covered by insurers in the G-7 or EU.\n\nRussia would likely try to evade the cap by organizing its own insurance and using the world's shadowy fleet of off-the-books tankers, as Iran and Venezuela have done, but that would be costly and cumbersome, analysts say.\n\nFacing those uncertainties for the global oil market, OPEC oil ministers led by Saudi Arabia could leave production levels unchanged or cut output again to keep prices from declining further. Low prices mean less revenue for governments of producing nations.\n\nMaintaining OPEC production targets makes sense because \"right now I think they see the market as adequately priced, adequately supplied, and there's no reason to rock the boat,\" said Gary Peach, oil markets analyst with Energy Intelligence.\n\nThe G-7 price cap could prompt Russia to retaliate and take oil off the market. But the cap of $60 a barrel is near the current price of Russian oil, meaning Moscow could continue to sell while rejecting the cap in principle. Oil use also declines in the winter, in part because fewer people are driving.\n\n\"If Russia ends up taking off more oil than about a million barrels per day, then the world becomes short on oil, and there would need to be an offset somewhere, whether that's from OPEC or not,\" said Jacques Rousseau, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners. \"That's going to be the key factor is to figure out how much Russian oil is really leaving the market.\"",

                "cc_text": "Never pass up an opportunity to use foreign policy as a prop in domestic theatre. This is the mantra apparently taken to heart by the Austrian government, which is vetoing the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area, while approving that of Croatia.\n\nTroubles at home\n\nThe situation was triggered by the crisis in which Chancellor Karl Nehammers government was mired. In 2019, the centre-right Peoples Party (VP) then led by Sebastian Kurz won a decisive victory in the snap election called in the wake of the Ibiza scandal. Rather than re-enter into coalition with its disgraced partner, the far-right Freedom Party (FP), the VP opted instead to partner with the Greens.\n\nIt transpired that the 2019 election was a highwater mark for the VP, senior functionaries of which were implicated in the various corruption investigations that grew out of the Ibiza scandal. Among them was Kurz himself, who had no choice but to resign as chancellor in October 2021 before leaving politics altogether two months later.\n\nKarl Nehammer, who had previously served as interior minister, consequently became chancellor and VP leader. Since then, the fortunes of the VP have only worsened. Nehammer is a more conciliatory figure than Kurz, but he is less a leader of his fractious party than a chairman juggling the interests of the various regional governors. Meanwhile, the corruption scandals have only grown, reinforcing the perception that the VP is structurally rotted in a way that Nehammer is either unwilling or unable to address.\n\nTaken together with the disastrous mismanagement of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, energy shortages and high inflation, the VP is haemorrhaging credibility. The polls suggest that, in the event of an election, the vote share of the party will fall from 37.5% to as low as 20%.\n\nMeanwhile, the issue of illegal migration has re-entered the public eye, with over 100,000 migrants filing asylum claims in Austria so far in 2022 and 75,000 of which remained in the country. This is higher even than at the height of the migrant crisis in 2015. Sensing that the FP would exploit the exposed right-flank of the VP, Nehammer mounted the one-trick pony that Kurz had ridden to such great effect in 2017.\n\nThe timing is not coincidental, as state elections will be held in Lower Austria at the end of January. Lower Austria is the foremost stronghold of the VP and its regional party branch is its most powerful faction. The party is already expecting to lose its last absolute majority in the state legislatures; but if Nehammer, whose beleaguered authority is propped up by the Lower Austrians, contributes to a worse result than expected, he will pay a dear price.\n\nDouble standards\n\nWhen the Czech presidency of the Council of the EU unexpectedly put Schengen membership for Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria on the agenda, the Austrian government found itself between a rock and a hard place from a domestic perspective.\n\nThe VP decided that it would come out swinging. Nehammer and his successor as interior minister, Gerald Karner, announced that Austria would veto the proposal for all three member states, arguing that the number of asylum applications indicated that their border controls were not functioning properly. The way in which the announcement was made was particularly provocative because it was done via the media a favoured practice of Kurz rather than being raised at the EU or bilateral level.\n\nBut Nehammer soon changed stance, saying that Austria would support the Schengen accession of Croatia as the government was satisfied that its external border controls were working properly. It was probably no coincidence that just days before, Nehammer had travelled with Bavarian premier Markus Sder to the LNG terminal on the island of Krk, where they met with Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. Nehammer and Sder received assurances from Plenkovic that the Adria pipeline would be expanded to serve the Austrian and Bavarian markets respectively, thereby reducing their dependence on Russian gas.\n\nFurthermore, according to a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Croatian stakeholders threatened to block upcoming Austrian investments into major infrastructure in the country, prompting the Austrian Chamber of Commerce (WKO) to lobby the government to change course. It also did not hurt that the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has extensive connections with the VP, with which it shares membership of the European Peoples Party (EPP).\n\nThe Austrian government conceded that Croatia was being used by migrants to illegally enter the Schengen area, having passed through Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Indeed, nationals from various third countries that do not enjoy visa-free access to the EU such as India and Tunisia may fly into Serbia without the need for a visa. However, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic agreed to scrap the visa-free regime for many of these countries, including India, in the near future. Thus Nehammer found himself able to backtrack on his veto threat.\n\nThereafter, the VP dug in on Romania and Bulgaria. The Interior Ministry (BMI) argued that it was not satisfied that their external border controls were adequate, despite assessments by Frontex that they fulfilled the technical criteria. The BMI cited its own study that found that of the nationals that had illegally entered Austria in 2022, 40 percent had come through Serbia, another 40 percent through Hungary via Romania and Bulgaria, with 20 percent coming via other routes. This contradicted Frontex data, but the BMI claimed that its figures are more reliable given that they are based on the mapping of mobile data as well as interviews with asylum seekers. At the same time, the study is not publicly available.\n\nThe WKO, anxious about Austrian business interests in Romania and Bulgaria, lobbied hard against the veto but without success. The Romanian MEP Eugen Tomac claimed that attempts to lobby Nehammer through the EPP were similarly fruitless: he rejected \"every rational argument\" and \"threw out every proposal the European Commission made, denied every report and every statistic.\" Hopes that the VP was simply posturing and would mimic the Dutch in accepting some symbolic assurances on border controls and corruption proved to be in vain.\n\nTheoretically the opposition of the VP is not categorical. The chancellery stated that it would support the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to Schengen once it was satisfied with their external border controls, suggesting that it is only a matter of time before the proposal can be tabled again. Yet Austrian sources in Romania and Bulgaria speaking on the condition of anonymity were very pessimistic that it would be so easy and that the intransigence of the government would do lasting damage to Austrian interests in those countries.\n\nThe anger is already palpable, with the Romanian interior minister expressing incredulity given that Karner had promised him support for Schengen membership back in February. Meanwhile, the president of the Romanian association for clean energy and countering climate change is calling for Austria to pay 200mn per month in compensation for the cost of the country remaining outside of Schengen.\n\nAustrian regional influence in decline?\n\nThe entire affair could be laughed off as a comedy of errors if the government were not holding 26mn EU citizens hostage, needlessly squandering the soft power that Austria has accumulated in Central-Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE).\n\nIndeed, before but particularly since 1989, Austria has been one of the states that was most supportive of the integration of the region into the EU. Austria was by no means altruistic in its motives; there were massive advantages to this strategy. Austrian investors found lucrative new markets in which they had a first movers advantage, while its economy was able to source cheap labour. Vienna was able to revive and reinvent its status as the de facto capital of the region.\n\nNonetheless, it was a stalwart ally of states in the region even as the political establishment often overestimated the extent of its geopolitical influence. Yet the VP with the tolerance of the Greens as well as the flip-flopping opposition Social Democrats (SP) is torpedoing this reputation in conducting itself in a way that is so nakedly political.\n\nFurthermore, in accommodating some member states while throwing others under the bus, it is showing itself up as cynical and untrustworthy. Nehammer was prepared to back down on his opposition to Croatian membership once Zagreb responded with the carrot and stick approach. The VP continues to court Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, holding three major meetings with him in 2022 alone, even though the country is the weakest link in the migration chain. Not only has the Orban government made it virtually impossible for asylum seekers to file claims, but it also waves them through to Austria.\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed in Bucharest or Sofia. A palpably deflated Austrian delegate with whom I spoke told me off the record that the decision is entirely \"political\" and that this would make life needlessly difficult for Austrian businesses, especially in Romania, which is one of the largest destinations in the EU for Austrian foreign investment. The government has not only thrown two allies under the bus, but its own economic interests as well. This is also ominous for the Western Balkans, where Vienna continues to command substantial influence even as it has declined elsewhere.\n\nThis muddled strategy illustrates the extent to which the VP is experiencing brain death. It accelerated under Sebastian Kurz but, along with the SP, began about two decades ago. Its big beasts have variously retired, died or been sidelined, leaving mostly careerist party apparatchiks. Once upon a time the VP was the most pro-European party in Austria. It called an ill-fated snap election in 2008 when the SP, for similarly populist reasons, announced via the tabloid press that it would subject any EU treaty changes to referenda. The days of such thinking are long gone.\n\nAustrian opposition to the Schengen membership of Romania and Bulgaria is a sobering demonstration of just how parochial its political culture has become and that this parochialism threatens to be periodically belched out of the domestic vacuum.\n\nMarcus How is the head of analysis at VE Insight, a business intelligence and political risk advisory based in Vienna.",

                "cc_text": "Brent crude oil price continued falling as the market reflected on this weeks cap of Russian oil. It plunged to $83.17, which is close to the lowest level since January this year. Oil has plummeted by about 40% from its highest level this year. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Russian urals have also retreated.\n\n2022 oil market review\n\nBrent crude oil price has had an eventful performance this year. It initially surged to over $130 in February when Russia invaded Ukraine and western governments unveiled their sanctions. The US was the first country to ban Russian oil.\n\nOil prices then retreated throughout the year as the impact of sanctions waned and as the slowdown of the Chinese market continued. Chinas GDP is expected to have the slowest growth in decades this year because of the lockdowns.\n\nFurther, actions by the United States also pushed oil prices lower. Joe Biden decided to release millions of oil barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) in a bid to lower gasoline prices.\n\nThe most recent oil price news was the decision by the G7 to place a limit on Russian ural price at $60. In its response, Russia warned that it will stop shipping oil to countries that participate in the cap. The European Union and the UK also joined to ban Russian oil.\n\nAnother oil news was the decision by OPEC+ to stick with its oil production target despite headwinds. There are signs that China is reopening its economy as well.\n\nBrent crude oil price forecast for 2022\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that Brent has been in a strong bearish trend in the past few months. Along the way, it managed to move below all moving averages and the important resistance level at $88.72. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved below the neutral point at 50 while the price is below the Supertrend indicator.\n\nTherefore, Brent crude oil price will likely end 2022 at or below the support at $80. A move above the resistance at $88.7 will invalidate the bearish view.\n\nOil prices prediction for 2023\n\nAnalysts have a mixed prediction of oil prices in 2023. Goldman Sachs analysts expect that oil prices will jump to $110 in 2023, helped by soaring demand from China.\n\nThe same view was shared by analysts at Bank of America, who expect that oil will soar to $110 in 2023. They noted the Chinese risk and supply disruptions in countries like Libya, Nigeria, and Iraq. They wrote:\n\n\"At present, we embed Russian total oil production levels of 10 mn b/d in our assumptions for 2023 compared to the 9.59 mn b/d figure provided by the IEA. Any meaningful downward deviation from these figures could turbocharge oil prices higher.\"\n\nOn the other hand, analysts at Citi are worried that crude oil prices will crash to about $45 in 2023. They wrote that Russian crude will remain robust despite the sanctions and that a global recession could hit demand. I am inclined to support Citis view that prices will likely remain low in 2023. Besides, Citis analysts have been relatively accurate this year.\n\nBrent forecast for 2025\n\nIt is difficult to predict where Brent crude oil prices will be in 2025. For one, it is hard to predict whether there will be another Covid-19 or not. All factors held constant, we expect that Brent will average between $55 and $80 by 2025. This view is based on the fact that countries will continue seeing strong demand for oil and that companies will continue pumping more oil.",

This is a momentous time for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, AML/CFT, policy. Sanctions are frequently on the front page of the major papers, and compliance is receiving unprecedented attention across a number of industries.\n\nHowever, before I go into these topics, I want to acknowledge the untimely passing of the American Bankers Associations Rob Rowe. Rob was a formidable foe at times, but he was an outstanding friend to our industry. His expertise and passionate commitment to anti-money laundering policy and rulemaking are unimpeachableI consider myself lucky to have come to know him and only regret that I didnt have more time to work alongside him on the AML issues so vital to the broader success of our financial system. He will be sorely missed and leaves us with the solemn responsibility to carry forth on his work and vision of creating a stronger and more transparent financial system.\n\nWe are all witnessing dramatic shifts in the global order: countries are still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia is engaged in a shocking and unjustifiable war in Europe, and the proliferation of digital assets and payment services are pushing the boundaries of financeand the risk of illicit financial flowsto places that would have been unfathomable a decade ago. These tectonic shifts matter a great deal to the health and functioning of the financial system and to our understanding of the risks encompassed within this system. That, after all, is what the field of AML/CFT is all about: how we identify and manage certain illicit finance risks within the context of the broader financial risks this system seeks to measure and efficiently address. We know that risk is not a one-way ratchet, where less is always better.\n\nToday, Id like to share our thinking on some of the key risks we all confront today and how we think about balancing them alongside our broader policy goals.\n\nRussia\n\nFor many of you, the risk that is top of mind is the illicit finance threat posed by Russia. In February of this year, Russia launched an illegitimate and brutal invasion into Ukraine. This violence continues to this dayRussia is not only attacking on the battlefield, but also striking Ukraines power grids and metropolitan residential areas specifically to inflict pain on Ukraines civilian population.\n\nResponsible nations of the world were quick to respond. Almost immediately after Russias first strikes, the United States was one of over 30 countries to implement sanctions or other economic measures against Russia in response to the invasion. Since then, we have created an effective, expansive, and multilateral web of restrictions targeting Russias ability to fund and wage its terrible war of choice.\n\nMost recently, in the last few weeks, the U.S. Treasury designated Russian national Dmitry Kudryakov alongside a Belarusian national for their roles in exploiting the Guatemalan mining sector. Also, Treasury designated entities facilitating the transfer of Iranian drones into Russia.\n\nThe evidence is clear that these actions are effectively denying Russia the financial means to wage their horrifying war. The Russian economy will be in a fiscal deficit by the end of this year. The IMF expects Russias economy to continue contracting for the next two years, Russias stock market remains depressed below pre-war levels, and Russias inflation rate remains in the double digits. Moreover, the U.S. intelligence community assesses that these actions have led to critical shortages of inputs needed for tanks, helicopters, and other critical military supplies.\n\nAnd while governments can create the policies that lead to these outcomes, you all have played the essential role of implementing these policies by reassessing your understanding of Russian illicit finance risks and adapting your businesses in response.\n\nSo long as Russia continues to wage its war in Europe, we will continue to work in concert with our international partners and take more and novel economic and financial actions targeting Russias ability to fund and execute its reprehensible war.\n\nThis is the root of a policy coming into effect todaya price cap on Russian oil. This policy is a way for the international community to apply economic pressure on Russias main source of revenue, energy earnings, while also ensuring the global energy market remains well supplied.\n\nAs the risks Russia poses have evolved, so too has our need to assess those risks. The reports, analysis, and typologies you develop identify and enable us to better understand the evolving risks associated with Russian illicit finance and are paramount in keeping the pressure on Russia to cease their violence. In fact, in terms of understanding risk and risk exposure, financial institutions are on the front lines and serve as our eyes and ears on providing critical insight on emerging illicit finance threats.\n\nIn turn, the information you report to us helps to influence, shape and inform our actions, whether it is new policy guidance, enforcement actions, or advisories, to help both the public and private sectors better understand the risks in front of us and craft the appropriate responses.\n\nRisk-Based Policy\n\nAs Secretary Yellen has stated before, the size and stability of our economy and financial sector make the United States, almost paradoxically, one of the most desired destinations for money laundering and illicit finance. While this creates numerous challenges, our resources are unfortunately not unlimited.\n\nThis means that we at the U.S. Treasury must also take a risk-based approach in crafting our policy responses, focusing our resources where they are needed and balancing the many risks we must manage.\n\nBeneficial Ownership\n\nTake beneficial ownership transparency as an example. On September 29, 2022, the U.S. Treasury moved forward with our implementation of the monumental Corporate Transparency Act by announcing a new rule on beneficial ownership reporting. This rule will aid law enforcement, national security agencies, and other partners by giving them the information they need to identify and crack down on criminals, corrupt individuals, and others seeking to take advantage of our financial system for illicit purposes. Our approach seeks to balance the risk that opaque financial structures are abused to obscure illicit financial flows against the compliance burden placed on industry by the rule and the resources needed to collect this information. We believe our approach strikes the right balance by focusing on the areas of greatest risk and giving our government tools to address them.\n\nInvestment Advisers\n\nInvestment advisers and the funds they manage offer another instance in which a risk-based approach is needed. According to the Investment Advisers Association, there are approximately 15,000 SEC-registered investment advisers who manage approximately $130 trillion in assets. While this includes tens of trillions managed by mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or other financial institutions that are subject to comprehensive AML/CFT obligations, there are significant parts of this sector subject to less stringent rules. The complexity of this population varies greatly: there are roughly 3,700 advisers to more than 40,000 private funds that have more than $20 trillion in total assets, whereas there are 17,000 state-registered advisers who manage smaller amounts of funds and have only one or two employees.\n\nOur preliminary research has identified several ways that investment advisers can be misused by illicit actors. We have seen investment advisers who facilitate the movement of illicit proceeds, such as those derived from foreign corruption, fraud, and tax evasion, into the U.S. financial system. In one instance, a Miami-based financial adviser used an investment fund scheme to launder 12 million dollars worth of bribes into the U.S. financial system. Surrounding and supporting this false-investment scheme were complicit money managers, brokerage firms, banks, and real estate investment firms in the United States and elsewhere, that were operating as a network of professional money launderers.\n\nAnother example of abuse in the investment adviser sector is Heritage Trust, a Delaware-based trust formed in July 2017, for the purpose of holding and managing Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimovs assets. Treasurys investigation into Kerimov, spurred by his first designation in 2018, revealed a complex web of legal structures and front persons to obscure his interest in the trust. Funds in the trust were subsequently invested in large public and private companies and managed by a series of U.S. investment firms and facilitators. Treasury blocked these funds in September of this year, but the magnitude and breadth of this scheme is indicative of the broader risk these vehicles can pose.\n\nWe are also concerned about how investment advisers and the funds they manage may offer foreign governments opportunities to invest in and gain access to firms involved in emerging and critical technologies such as microelectronics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and biomanufacturing, quantum computing, and advanced clean energy. According to our colleagues at the Department of Justice, the Chinese government routinely conceals its ownership or control of investment funds to disguise efforts to steal technology or expertise while attempting to avoid the scrutiny of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, more commonly referred to by its acronym, CFIUS.\n\nThe systemic mismatch between AML obligations and the information available to those holding these obligations creates a real risk for our system. For instance, qualified custodians and prime brokers have AML obligations but do not have regular access to information about the clients of investment advisers they serve and may not see all investment activity by the investment adviser when conducted in omnibus accounts by the advisers. This structure limits the ability of custodians and brokers in identifying suspicious activity tied to the clients of the investment advisers.\n\nAdditionally, business activities in the investment adviser space are segmented, bloating the number of intermediaries, crossing international borders, and increasing the distance between the actual investor and those who move the assets around. These business practices promote obfuscation of the client or investor identity and outsource compliance responsibilities to those who are operating with an incomplete picture.\n\nLastly, on private fundsthese businesses routinely invest funds on behalf of foreign legal entities, through arrangements that do not require them to disclose the ultimate beneficial owner. According to the most recent data we have, private funds held $305 billion in assets that were beneficially owned by non-U.S. investors, but they did not have the information on hand to identify the specific owners in question. Further, many of these funds are domiciled in jurisdictions with uneven AML/CFT supervision and routinely rely on representations and warranties from intermediaries who cannot obtain client identity or information about the source of funds.\n\nWe know the investment adviser sector is diverse, ranging from small firms managing retiree assets to firms investing billions and trillions of assets on behalf of pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds, and that the risk may vary based on an advisers clients and the services they offer. As noted in the U.S. Treasurys 2022 National Illicit Finance Strategy, our first step is to build a better understanding of this sector and the risk typologies within it. This exercise will help us build a risk-based approach that focuses our energy and resources in the right way.\n\nReal Estate including Commercial Real Estate\n\nAnother sector we are examining to better understand risk is real estate, both residential and commercial. Much like the investment adviser sector, the real estate market in the United States is also incredibly broad and diverse, with corresponding differences in the kinds of risk different parts of this sector pose.\n\nTreasury has promulgated comprehensive AML/CFT regulations for residential mortgage lenders and originators, as well as government-sponsored housing entities, which covers an estimated 76 percent of the $43.4 trillion residential real estate market.\n\nThe remaining portion of the U.S. real estate market that is not subject to comprehensive AML/CFT regulation includes non-financed residential real estate transactions and certain commercial real estate transactions. We assess the size of this market is approximately $20 trillion.\n\nAs you all are aware, starting in 2016, Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, issued a series of Geographic Targeting Orders to impose reporting requirements for certain non-financed residential transactions and, the resulting information is helping us to better understand associated risks. In December 2021, FinCEN also published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on potential systemic solutions to address the illicit finance risks in the real estate sector.\n\nFor illicit financiers, commercial real estate is an attractive market in which to hide and grow illicit funds because it is deep and liquid, identity-obfuscating legal entities are commonplace, financial intermediaries facilitating this activity are not subject to comprehensive AML/CFT regulations, and investors frequently pool funds for lending and purchases. In other words, the banal business activities at the core of this market are unfortunately well-suited to their illicit activities. These vulnerabilities are compounded when foreign investors purchase or invest in U.S. commercial real estate using foreign investment vehicles and legal entities/arrangements, further complicating efforts to identify ultimate beneficiaries and the sources of their wealth. At this point, its not hiding a needle in a haystack, it is hiding a very particular needle in a stack of needles.\n\nRecent high profile law enforcement cases involving the proceeds of corruption and narcotics demonstrates that criminal actors are indeed using commercial real estate properties to obfuscate their funds. In one example, proceeds from international drug trafficking were invested in a hotel less than twenty miles from this location. In another case, the proceeds of fraud were alleged to have purchased three office properties worth more than $60 million across the country.\n\nAs we continue to fine-tune our understanding of risk in this sector, I would just restate how important your information is to our understanding of these risks.\n\nDe-risking\n\nFinally, I want to address the other side of risk managementthe one that receives less attention but is no less critical as a matter of policy: de-risking, or the practice of voluntary \"over-compliance.\"\n\nThe foundation and expectation of our anti-money laundering regime is that financial institutions implement a risk-based approach to identify and address risks. But what does that mean in practice?\n\nUnlike a rules-based approach where everyone follows exactly the same rulebook, the risk-based approach offers both the public and private sectors the opportunity to create a bespoke set of practices tailored to the particular assets, interests, or businesses at issue even where the same fundamental program requirements exist for all regulated entities. Nevertheless, no two businesses are identical and therefore no two businesses face exactly the same risks.\n\nImplicit in this approach is that areas of greater risk require more resources to mitigate, and areas of lower risk require fewer resources. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 embraces and enshrines in law a systematic risk-based approach, such as through the development of AML/CFT National Priorities and their integration into the supervisory and examination process.\n\nThere are, of course, challenges in implementing a truly risk-based approach. At the Financial Action Task Force, which adopted the risk-based approach to combating illicit finance in 2012, we have observed that countries and their financial institutions are keenly aware of where enhanced due diligence is needed but often can not readily identify the inverse: places where simplified due diligence should be expected and permitted. This is not meant to point the fingerin the U.S. government and in our private sector, too, it is a natural impulse to focus more on what is needed for high-risk areas than lower-risk parts.\n\nWhile this impulse is understandable, it is not without costs. De-risking is chief among them and is illustrative of why a true risk-based approach must take into account both sides of this coin. One common form of de-risking is when financial institutions categorically cut off relationships or services to avoid perceived risksfor example, certain geographic regionsrather than applying a nuanced, risk-based approach.\n\nI understand that financial institutions have to make profit-driven decisions to stay in business, and that profit concerns are often cited for severing services like correspondent banking relationships. Nevertheless, I have heard time and time again about the deleterious effects of categorical de-risking. Money service businesses losing accounts based on a banks decision to categorically exclude them because of their location or status as a nonbanking financial institution. Moreover, the jurisdictions subject to these concerns are often emerging markets with underbanked populations and higher rates of povertyplaces where access to these services could do immense good, if made available in a way consistent with a thorough risk-based approach.\n\nTo me, this reveals two concerns related to financial institutions ability to assess risk. The first is that some financial institutions are not applying a risk-based approach, which would entail taking the time to truly understand their risks. Instead, they are applying a de facto rules-based approach, and cutting off business instead of truly matching resources to risk. While this gives the impression of a strong compliance policy, in reality it can leave significant gaps as institutions lose access to evolving information about these jurisdictions to analyze future trends or report on new suspicious activity. Money launders, terrorists, and sanctions evaders are always adapting their methods and financial institutions must adapt with them and not use their AML obligations to walk away entirely.\n\nMy second concern is that when experienced and responsible financial institutions such as those here today disengage from specific sectors or whole jurisdictions, we are empowering those with less stringent compliance and oversight by driving business toward them. Remittances are a good example of this. When remittances are unable to process through traditional financial networks, we empower cash smugglers, traffickers, and less reputable financial facilitators to take over this business outside of the United States. Should this type of business grow too large, it could undermine the centrality of the U.S. financial system, or of large, well-regulated, stable financial systems generally, and become a national security concern. Also, it imposes higher costs on precisely the populations least able to bear them, a factor which can lead to a host of economic, governance, and social challenges.\n\nCongress has mandated the U.S. Department of the Treasury to study these concerns through the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020. My team will be coming out with a strategy to address de-risking, which will include recommendations on how to improve public-private engagement on this issue, regulatory guidance and adjustments, and international supervision.\n\nConclusion\n\nI want to conclude my remarks by highlighting some commonalities among the constituencies represented here. Ive spoken at length about how risk is unique to each jurisdiction, institution, and situationit is different based on what each institution prioritizes and how it interacts with the world. What I want to note, however, is that there are also important commonalities that bind us, and our approaches, together. Some events, like the Russian invasion and the global pandemic, are so broad ranging that we all cannot help but be affected. Finally, and most importantly, all of us here are unified in our vision to work towards a safer, more transparent, and more prosperous financial system. Treating risk with the nuance and detail it deserves across these areas is one way I hope we can work together to achieve that shared goal\n\nThank you for your time and I look forward to carrying this mission forward with you all.",

If you want to see more ETFs in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing Commodity ETFs in 2022.\n\nAs per a new S&P Global Market Intelligence report, dated November 4, commodities prices for core metals will be hit by the macro backdrop facing the global economy through most of 2023. However, these commodities are positioned to survive the market turbulence in the long-term as they are essential for energy transition. Due to the Inflation Reduction Act being passed, the US renewable energy generation capacity is expected to increase by nearly 150GW in the next few years and global demand for electric vehicles will jump approximately 30% yearly through 2026. This means that metals including copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel will remain highly demanded.\n\nGlobal Commodities Outlook 2023\n\nHowever, the uncertain global economic environment offers a mixed commodities outlook for the year ahead. According to the BMO Capital Markets Commodity Price Index, commodity prices climbed in October after half a year of consistent declines in the wake of Russias invasion of Ukraine. Against tighter monetary and fiscal policies, BMO Economics now forecasts global growth to slow from 3.0% in 2022 to 2.3% in 2023, with multiple economies around the world facing at least mild recessions.\n\nFor example, BMO Economics expects higher volatility in the energy space in the near-term, given attempts to cap Russian oil prices. Similarly, agricultural prices are impacted by uncertainty around grain exports from Ukraine and softer demand worldwide. In 2023, BMO predicts that aluminum and lumber prices will also be affected due to residential construction headwinds.\n\nBrent crude oil is forecasted to average around $100 per barrel in 2023 and peak at $110, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is expected to average $94 per barrel, as per the Bank of America. BofA also announced its latest forecast for US natural gas and noted that supply will exceed demand, pushing prices down to $4.50, while refusing Russian gas will keep liquified natural gas and coal markets tight.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrent crude oil prices declined heavily during the third quarter of 2022, with prices in September 2022 averaging 25 percent less than their June highs. The fall in oil prices represents fears about a global recession next year, ongoing pandemic restrictions in China, and meaningful releases from different reserves. However, commodity prices remain high in several countries in domestic currency terms as their currencies have depreciated against the US dollar.\n\nDevelopments in coal markets have been largely influenced by rampant natural gas prices, which led many countries to transition from natural gas to coal for power generation. Additionally, the European Unions decision to ban Russian coal also switched up trade flows, as Europe has shifted to Colombia, South Africa, the United States, and even Australia for coal imports. Food commodity prices dropped in Q3 2022 from their all-time highs in April. The plunge was a result of larger-than-anticipated edible and oilseed global supplies during the current season, the UN agreement that enabled Ukrainian grains to be sold in global markets, and slow global growth prospects.\n\nIn light of the current global commodities landscape, while equities like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) often make it to investor portfolios, many individuals lean towards exchange traded funds that are managed by professionals. This minimizes portfolio risk and allows exposure to multiple asset classes which are otherwise too advanced for a layman to understand, such as futures, swaps, and other derivatives.\n\nETF investors have benefited from a rebound in Q4 after the very challenging first three quarters of 2022. ETFs representing the primary asset classes saw positive momentum after the October inflation numbers came in lower than anticipated. ETFs represent 12% of equity assets in the US, 6.8% in Europe, and 3.8% in the Asia Pacific. In the third quarter of 2022, average daily trading volumes for US equities and US ETFs came in at $484 billion and $148.9 billion, respectively. This suggests that US ETFs represented approximately 31% of the total US composite volume in the secondary market over the quarter.\n\n10 Best Performing Commodity ETFs in 2022\n\nPhoto by Francisco Fernandes on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWith this industry outlook in mind, we selected the following commodity ETFs based on positive share price gains year-to-date as of December 6.

Our guest is Louis-Vincent Gave founding partner and CEO of Gavekal, a leading independent provider of macro research in Gavekal Capital a global asset manager. In todays episode, Louis kicks it off with the biggest topic in global markets today, the chief pivot and reopening of China. He shares his outlook for how it may affect global supply chains, commodity markets, financial markets, he covers the case for emerging markets, why he isnt bullish on the U.S., and why it may be time to rethink your portfolio construction as we head into a new year. Please enjoy this episode with Gavekals Louis-Vincent Gave. Louis, welcome to the show.\n\nLouis-Vincent: Thank you very much. Thanks for having me. Good to meet you.\n\nMeb: Where do we find you today?\n\nLouis-Vincent: Im on Vancouver Island. About 30 minutes north of Victoria.\n\nMeb: I got to see your view out the window. Im also looking out the window here is a beautiful SoCal day. Its a little Pacific Northwesty you mentioned youre a little bit interior, not Victoria waters a little colder. Where are you?\n\nLouis-Vincent: Yeah, Im on a place called Cobble Hill, right on the water as well. So were looking, I guess at the same ocean, but youre probably right. Its not exactly the same weather its dark and gray. Actually, I own a property that used to be owned 100 years ago by Al Capone. He used to run his whiskey from here because were right across from the San Juan Islands. So he would load up some small ships and bring whiskey over to the San Juan Islands that are obviously U.S. owned and put the whiskey on to bigger boats that would then go down to LA and San Francisco. Im basically in the Bahamas of the days.\n\nMeb: You find any Capone artifacts, any bottles of whiskey in the basement?\n\nLouis-Vincent: No, I was hoping. No old guns, no bottles of whiskey, no hidden stashes of money. Nothing at all, no, been very disappointing. We should have had Ronaldo come and open the basement, but no, nothing like that.\n\nMeb: So you spent a pretty good amount of time in Hong Kong as well. A lot of the team there. How do you kind of divvy up the travel these days?\n\nLouis-Vincent: So our firm is based in Hong Kong, and I spend most of my career there. Ive lived in Hong Kong more than Ive lived anywhere in my life. As you point out Gavekal my company is headquartered in Hong Kong, we have an office in Beijing, we have an office in Singapore. So were primarily an Asian firm. Before COVID. I was sort of doing half and half obviously, during COVID. That was impossible. I did go back a few times and dealt with the quarantine and everything else. But since then, Ive basically been mostly here. Im starting to go back and forth again. I was just back in Hong Kong for three weeks. Just got back. And now Im here.\n\nMeb: All right. So Ive been a long-time listener anytime I see you come across my podcast feed or get lucky to read one of your research reports, I jump at it. And Ive always been a big fan. You certainly have a view thats global, most U.S. investors, and this is institutions too they love to have the home country bias, as does everyone really, but you have a global perspective. So were going to talk about a lot today. And Im going to let you choose where we begin, whether its U.S. or whether its China. Were recording this mid-beginning of December 2022. Whats the world look like as we finish this year?\n\nLouis-Vincent: I think the big story is Chinas reopening, right? You have the second-largest economy in the world thats been kept mothballed for three years. Now its reopening. And I think that begs a ton of questions. Its how much pent-up demand is there going to be? How much supply chain dislocations are we going to face? What does the reopening of China tell us for the near-term political health of the country? I mean, there are so many different rabbit holes, we can go down. But for me, thats the big change. And its all the more important change since we know that the U.S. economy is slowing down. If you look at most leading indicators, whether your ISM surveys, your yield curves, your OECD leading indicators, theyre all pointing to some kind of slowdown, same story in Europe, probably worse in Europe. Actually. We also know that each time Chinese growth has really accelerated in 2003, in 2008, in 2015, it sort of triggered a rebound in the global industrial cycle, China reopening is going to lead to a rebound. The question is how much, and is it going to be big enough to trigger a global rebound? That for me is a big question. So I think bottom line, we should start with China.\n\nMeb: All right, so I think a lot of listeners investors say, Okay, well, weve seen this play before China looks like theyre going to start to reopen and they dont they shut everything down. One of the different things seems to be an indicator of this last grouping has been the protests, is that something from a Western media perspective is legit and real? And is this causing a real pivot. Or is it something that, you know, is just going to get smashed down and go back to lockdowns?\n\nLouis-Vincent: No, I think it is causing a real pivot. And here, thats perhaps where theres divergence between the western view of China and the reality on the ground. Most people in the Western world probably dont realize this. But there are protests all the time in China. Theyre not covered by CNN or CNBC or anybody, because the protests are typically about local issues, polluted water, or corrupt officials, or whatever else. So you have a sort of roadmap as to how the Chinese government deals with protests. And the roadmap is they give in as quickly as possible, what they do is they blame middle management. So theyll fire the local mayor, fire the party official, and then they give in and they give in because fundamentally, the Chinese Communist Party owes its legitimacy from its ability to keep social stability.\n\nNow, I know in the Western world, the view is, the Chinese Communist Party owes its legitimacy to its ability to deliver the economic goodies to deliver growth. But thats actually not true. What the Chinese Communist Party prides itself on is maintaining social harmony, peace, etc. Partly because if you look at Chinas own history, from basically 1850, till 1975, it was nothing but anarchy, hyperinflation, famines, foreign invasion, Civil War, it was the most miserable place to live for 125 years. So the bottom line theres a huge premium to social stability in China massive premium. And I know that in the Western world, when we think Chinese protests, our minds immediately hark back to 1989, right, because those were very powerful images, the guy blocking the tanks the students getting shut down. These are powerful images.\n\nSo in our minds, we see this, when the protests broke out a couple of weeks ago, everybody thought, oh, my God theres going to be another Tiananmen, theyre going to send the troops, theyre going to shoot down everybody in the streets. Its going to be horrible. Not at all. Instead, what were seeing is, theyve turned around, and theyre rapidly reopening, you had an editorial in the Beijing times last week highlighting that, look, when we shut down, it was the right thing to do, because COVID was very deadly, but COVID isnt very deadly anymore. Weve had now 5000 cases a day in Beijing for the past week, weve had zero deaths. So we can reopen COVID is no longer deadly. And that is now basically, the message being pushed out there.\n\nAnd the only question now is how fast is the reopening going to happen. And what are the consequences? Now the good news is we sort of have a playbook. Weve seen reopenings. In the U.S., weve seen reopenings in Europe, weve seen reopenings in Australia, and Brazil, wherever else. And youve sort of always seen the same thing, massive pent-up demand, but at the same time, and for me, thats the big question is when you first reopen, everybody catches COVID. And it doesnt mean you die, because actually, the death rate is really low. But everybody calls in sick. Do you remember a couple summers ago, when the U.S. reopened? It was the summer of the canceled flights. All the flights were canceled because the pilots were calling in sick because the stewardesses were calling in sick, do you remember you live in LA, you had like 100 ships waiting outside of LA because the dockers were calling in sick the truckers were calling in sick. You had massive supply chain dislocations everywhere, simply because people wouldnt show up to work for two weeks. Chinas now going to experience this. You have to imagine that the virus is going to run through the country, partly because thats what the virus does. Partly because China is a very, very densely populated country.\n\nThe landmass of China is roughly the same as the U.S. but its four times the population and its like everybody lives along the east coast. So its super, super densely populated. So bottom line, I think if your business model, lets say your Apple, and your business model is dependent on having 100,000 workers show up and live in dorms on top of each other, youre going to have a tough three to six months, because those guys are going to be sick.\n\nMeb: Yeah. So your best guess as you look to this, and culturally speaking, accounting for the differences is this something that you feel like China has really planned for? Theyre like, all right, were going to stock up on materials. We know that this is coming at some point were going to prepare for this or is this something thats just going to be a massive surge in consumer demand that overwhelms everything? Like, whats the kind of implications that you think as far as markets and economies this is really going to have?\n\nLouis-Vincent: I wish I knew. I wish I knew. I do think China was in the path of reopening, you saw Hong Kong already reopened, they already reduced the amount of quarantine to come into China. So it was on this path already. So I think that there was some level of planning. I do believe the demonstrations have brought everything forward and at an accelerated pace, but they were going in that direction anyway. Now, have they stockpiled commodities? Yes, I believe they have. Because if you look at the data, for me, one of the more interesting data points that nobody talks about is pre-COVID, China was importing 4 billion a month worth of commodities from Russia, every month, post-COVID. These past few months, China was importing 11 billion. So almost three times as much. You would look at this and you think, hows this happening when theres no construction going on? When the real estate markets been tanking? When obviously, everybodys stuck at home. It has to be stockpiling.\n\nAnd in that regards, its interesting that as China reopens I along with a lot of people expected energy prices to rally hard. Its like Chinas consuming a million and a half barrels less than it otherwise would. But its not happening. So on the commodities front, I think that they have stockpiled. But heres the other question. In the U.S. when people came out of lockdowns, they found out that mortgage rates were 100 basis point below where they were when theyd gone into lockdown. They found out that for the same monthly car payment, instead of getting a Toyota, you could get a BMW or you could get a second car. And everybody did that. Its like, oh, for the same monthly payments, I can get 50% more house, oh, Ill upgrade my house. And then everything that goes along with it, I need to buy a new fridge, I need to buy a new oven, then you find out like supply chain dislocations all over the shop. I highlight this because while everywhere in the world mortgage rates have just gone up 200, 300, 400 basis points in China in the past 12 months have gone down 150 basis points.\n\nSo now people are going to come out of lockdown. And theyre going to find out that oh, my car payment is so much cheaper. I can afford two cars instead of one. Or I can afford 50% more apartment. So the big question is, are they going to do that? Because, yes, they might have stockpiled commodities, but they didnt stockpile Toyota cars. They didnt stockpile ovens and fridges. Nobody does that. So if at the same time, the Toyota factory in China, or the Honda factory in China doesnt get delivered gearbox because the guys at the gearbox factory all have COVID, then of course, you cant deliver a car. If you have a car without a gearbox, you have a paperweight. And so I think the potential for supply chain dislocation on the consumer goods side is quite high. In essence, why should we expect China to have a different experience than what we had? Thatd be my question. When I say we, I mean, France or the U.S. or most of the western world, I think as China reopens, youre going to get the increase in demand on the one side, and the supply chain dislocations on the other. So its going to be potentially the last COVID-linked inflationary shock to the system.\n\nMeb: And so as we started to think about China and assets in a portfolio, we tweet a lot about emerging markets. But China in particular being the elephant of emerging markets, you know, the average U.S. investor, if you look at I think global market cap emerging markets is lets call it 13% ish depends on if you do float-adjusted or whatever, but the average American has about 2%. I think Goldman says in emerging markets, so way underweight in general, but China and particularly on the equity side, if you look at the valuations, its either at or near the cheapest its ever been going back 30 plus years the market going down 60% has a way of causing that to happen, of course, who are the winners and losers? As we look out Chinese stocks, they look good to you they risky, as we look around the implications of this, whats the impact?\n\nLouis-Vincent: Id add one more thing. Two months ago, I was doing call after call with clients who were asking, Is China uninvestable, which is of course what you ask before it falls 60%. So I think theres been like, everybodys puked out China and there was a sort of cathartic moment with the peoples Congress when they took out Hu Jintao and very publicly humiliated him and Xi Jinping basically monopolized all political power. Everybody decided all right Im out. For me. That was the final puke. And since then its been good news after good news. But you know the luck. The bottom line is Chinas reopening. How do you play that you buy China, I mean, lets not beat around the bush. Its undervalued, its under-owned, and you have a positive catalyst for growth, positive catalysts for earnings. And it has started to outperform. The beauty is its a liquid market, its decently big. Theres some fast-growing names in there. So thats the obvious play. But to your point, China, its the second biggest economy in the world. And its the primary source of growth for most emerging markets. You look at the Indonesias the Thailands, the Saudi Arabias of this world, their growth are increasingly tied to whats happening in China.\n\nAnd so the fact that China is now rebounding is going to be a great boon for all these guys. Now, its also a very important market for Japan and for Europe, if youre very reluctant to take risk, and you think, I cant trust emerging market accounting, or this or that you can play through Japan or through Europe, Ill just highlight one thing if wed had this chat a year ago. And if I told you look over the coming year, youre going to see the Fed be much more hawkish than anybody expects. Theyre going to raise rates, 400 basis points, or 375. But whatever, while the markets expecting 150, so much more hawkish than anybody expects, number one, number two, the U.S. dollar, as a result is going to rebound very strongly, the DXY is going to go up 22% in six months, which its basically only done once before. And number three, Chinas going to stay on lockdown, and a much harder lockdown than anybody expects for the next 12 months. If we thought that a year ago, we would have said, \"Oh, my God, just avoid emerging markets. Its going to be a bloodbath,\" right? Tied to Fed, strong U.S. dollar, weak China. That was like a recipe for a massive faceplant.\n\nNow, interestingly, in the past year, you look at whether on the bond side or the equity side markets like Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, India, theyve all outperformed the U.S. bond and equity markets in spades. This is highly unusual, because emerging markets in general, they tend to be the redhead stepchildren of financial markets. When things go bad, theyre the first ones to get slapped. In Asia, where Ive spent most of my career, you take a market like Indonesia, Indonesia is your typical market, you avoid each time theres a sell-off, it always gets sold hard. And yet this year Indonesian bonds, you barely lose any money on them. And you actually make money on Indonesian equities. I highlight this because for me bear markets as unpleasant as they are out there for a reason. Theyre there to transfer the leadership of one group of stock to the next. Were in the midst of a bear market. Its not fun. Nobody enjoys it. But while youre in a bear market, what you need to do is try to look for where are you seeing outperformance? And today, one of the places youre seeing clear outperformance in spite of massive macro headwinds is emerging markets.\n\nNow, lets fast forward to the coming year. What are going to be the trends next year? Number one, by far the biggest trend, China reopens massive, very important trend. Number two, I think theres a good chance the Fed is basically done rising pretty soon, they might have one more rate hike and then maybe two, but thats roughly it. Number three, the U.S. dollar has already started to roll over, identifying that the Fed is getting close to done, the U.S. dollar is rolling over. So those huge three headwinds to emerging markets are now turning into tailwinds because when the U.S. dollar is weak, thats good for emerging markets. When the Fed doesnt tighten, its good for emerging markets. And when China is booming, thats good for emerging markets, emerging markets outperformed when they should have underperformed. So what are they going to do now? I think its the place to be emerging markets, the markets right now, if you just listen to them, its telling you this is the new bull markets. This is where you need to deploy capital. And to your point, everybodys looking at it and be like, no, Im not doing this. And Americans have like you point out 2% of their assets in emerging markets. So theyre going to miss that whole first massive leg in the bull market.\n\nMeb: One last thing on emerging markets that I think is probably one of the reasons particularly the big institutions had a big pause, and individuals too was the entire Russian securities market becoming essentially paused or uninvestable. Russia is largely a rounding error compared to China, as far as size with these investing markets, even though like 95% of emerging market funds own Russian stocks, they look and say, wait a minute, this is a possible playbook for China, Taiwan. Its hard to ever come up with odds but is that something that should be a serious concern from the investor standpoint is it likely unlikely consensus non-consensus what do you got?\n\nLouis-Vincent: It should but perhaps not for the reason you think. So first, I dont believe for a second Chinas going to invade Taiwan. They cant pull it off, mounting an amphibious operation of 100 miles of sea. Hitler when he controlled the whole of Europe didnt even try to invade Britain, and that was just six miles of sea. Mounting and figures, operations is the hardest thing in military and Taiwan is a chain of mountains that fall into the sea. And when you look at the struggles that Russia is having to invade Ukraine, and thats just sending tanks over fields of wheat, then forget that its like Taiwan isnt going to happen. But the question is, nonetheless important, because it highlights the underlying theme of the day, which is deglobalization. When most people think of deglobalization. They think of the Apple supply chain or the Nike supply chain, and whether that moves back towards the U.S. The much more important deglobalization is the deglobalization of financial flows, the fact that Russians obviously cant invest in anywhere, but Russia now.\n\nAnd if you are a European investor, if youre a U.S. investor, all of a sudden, you think, oh, maybe China is a dangerous place for me to deploy capital. But that knife cuts both ways. If youre Chinese, and you look at this Russian invasion, if youve been a rich guy in China, for the past 20 years, each time you made money, you bought a house in Vancouver, or a house in Sydney, or a house in London, you redeployed capital in the Western world, because the greatest comparative advantage of the western world is the rule of law. Its property rights, its the fact that if I have a problem whether Im black, brown, yellow, whether Im Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Hindu, I go in front of a court of law, in Vancouver, in London, in New York, and Im treated equally next to the next guy, right? Its all flat. Except weve just added a little asterisk to this. Weve said except if youre Russian. If youre Russian we can take all your stuff, we can take your football club, we can take your house in Saint Tropez, we can take your yachts, we can take your private jets, we can take your house in South Kensington. And we can do this without any court orders. Without any discussion in Parliament. We basically have the G7 world leaders get together over a weekend and they decide to do this.\n\nNow, if youre Chinese, you see this, you think, okay, except if youre Russian today, it could be except if youre Chinese tomorrow, this house in Vancouver that I bought on the premise that it was a safe house if in case things went wrong in China I could always move to Vancouver. Well, actually, this house isnt what I think it was it is because if things do go bad, then it can get confiscated. And so following this Russian invasion, I think weve undermined the biggest when I say we I mean the Western world, our biggest comparative advantage, the rule of law and the sanctity of property rights, weve torn that up. I dont think we realize it. When you live in the Western world, you dont realize weve just done that. But from an emerging market, where youre very attuned to these things. Because youre always worried that the government is going to come and take your stuff. If youre rich in China, if youre rich in Saudi Arabia, youre worried the governments going to come and take your stuff. Look at what happened to the Saudi princes, when MBS got to power, right, they all got to be holed up in the Ritz Carlton and basically for a shakedown.\n\nSo when you come from an emerging market, always worried about this, and the Western world was always the place where you deploy capital. If you were Chinese, and you bought houses in Australia, or the UK, you didnt do it because you thought this would have good returns, you did it for the safety of the capital, forget the returns, you didnt care about the return on capital, you cared about the safety of capital. So we undermine that. And since weve undermined that, whats happened, our bond markets have collapsed, bond yields have gone through the roof property is going down. And here you get to the crux of the matter, which is why I thought this deglobalization matters a lot more than people think, but perhaps for the wrong reasons. Theyve got it backwards. You take a country like the U.S., you take a country like my own France, you take the UK, these are countries that have run for 20 years, massive twin deficits, big trade deficits on the one hand, big budget deficits on the other, you need somebody to fund that. And the way we funded that was by selling assets to foreigners.\n\nThe biggest assets we sold were one government bonds and two real estates. And we sold it to the countries that had constant current account surpluses. The Saudi Arabias of this world, the Burhans the Qatars the Chinas the Bruneis, if you look around the world, most western democracies have big twin deficits. Most emerging markets have big twin surpluses. So weve lived in this odd world where poor countries are funding rich countries, and they were doing so because of the security of capital. Now, if youre China, you think if youre Chinese, I dont want to buy any more Vancouver real estate. I dont want to buy any more London or LA real estate. Now what youre going to do is youre going to buy your real estate in Singapore, youre going to buy it in Dubai, which are really miniscule markets. So its going to be a lot of money going into a very, very small place. And for me, this deglobalization of finance is perhaps one of the explanations why emerging markets have outperformed this year when really they shouldnt have is the savings are no longer going to flow from emerging markets to developed markets. Theyre going to stay in emerging markets, begging the question of, okay, how is the U.S. going to fund twin deficits worth 7%, 8%, 9% percent of GDP. How is the UK going to do that? The answer is that they wont. And so the currencies will have to fall.\n\nMeb: So other than shorting Vancouver real estate, I heard you guys mention, India has been having a nice run of it lately in their equity market. Theyre one of the most expensive markets that we track, most of the countries around the world we think are pretty reasonable too cheap to screaming cheap, the U.S. is not in that bucket, we think theyre still pretty expensive market cap weighted, but what story with India? Are they going to be a beneficiary or are they going to get hurt by the China reopening?\n\nLouis-Vincent: I think in the short term, they get hurt. So first, look, India is always expensive. Its been expensive, pretty much my entire career. Its expensive, because its an exciting story, its an exciting story of a rising middle class of pretty good track record of local entrepreneurs and using capital relative to a lot of emerging markets, its got a lot going for it. Now, the one great new advantage for India is, in every cycle India, whenever oil prices rose too much, they would get crushed because they have to import so much of their energy. And so theyd have a deterioration in their current account balances, which would force the central banks to tighten, and youd enter a bear market, something new is happening in India, in that theyre getting to pay for more and more of their energy in their own currency. Theyre buying their oil from not only Russia but also Iran in Indian rupees. So that basically relieves a sort of Damocles sword from over their head or at least a sort of current account constraint that was always there. Having said that, I think one of the reason Indias done quite well, is that if youre an EM manager, or if youre a Pan Asian manager, its been the only good story this year, that and to some extent, Brazil, but you have some political uncertainty in Brazil.\n\nSo if youre an EM manager, and you have to go pitch your clients, and you cant say, well, where are you invested? You want to say India, because then you dont get nasty questions. If you say, Oh, Im overweight China, you get all sorts of nasty questions. Oh, but arent you worried about Taiwan being invaded, money being frozen, etc, etc. So, the way perhaps, you know, that swing games that kids have where one goes up, the other goes down, and it swings like this, to me, this is how China and India are, when foreign investors decide, cant be in China, for whatever reason, the money all goes to India, all the EM money, but then when China rebounds, the money has to come from somewhere. And initially, it comes from India. So as you look at China reopening, I think the first adjustment will be every emerging market fund, every Pan Asian fund will have to sell India and buy China. So in the near term, Chinas reopening is not great news for India. But I think once you pass that phase of portfolio readjustments which will probably take six to nine months, then India is fine, just like its not going to be a great six to nine months thats it.\n\nMeb: This episode is brought to you by Cambria, a global asset manager, unhappy with your portfolios performance this year with one of the worst starts ever for traditional U.S. stocks and bonds.

Investing involves risk including possible loss of capital past performance is not indicative of future results.\n\nLets talk a little bit about the U.S. which Ive heard you describe as for the better part of a while the cleanest dirtiest shirt, which is like my theme for the pandemic I feel like of my wardrobe. What does that mean, when were talking about the U.S. economy? I mean, the U.S. dollar is just romping and stopping the U.S. stock market has been the only place to be for a better part of a decade. Is that coming to an end? What do you see?\n\nLouis-Vincent: I think its already come to an end. And I think it was Bruce Kovner of Caxton who said where hes made the most money in his career is when everybody he talks to was telling him one thing, but the market was already telling him something else. And today to your point, the general perception out there partly because of the U.S. dollar strength is that the U.S. is the cleanest dirty shirt. Its the only thing that can be seen in. Everything else, Europe has got potential energy crisis. China is uninvestable. By default, youre left with the U.S. So the general perception is the U.S. is the place to be but meanwhile, when you look at the performance of markets again, you know youve made money in Brazil this year. Youve made money in India, youve made money in Mexico, youve made money in Indonesia, theres so many big markets that did fine. So the market is everybody tells you oh U.S. is the cleanest dirty shirt. And meanwhile, its like well hold on stock market thats down 20%. And the bond market thats down 20% does not qualify as a clean, dirty shirt, its just a plain dirty shirt. Its just dirty, and you shouldnt be seen in it.\n\nSo the bottom line for me is, if you project yourself to the coming year, whats going to be the big story, one is China reopening. So weve covered that. I think the second story for 2023 will be a lot of U.S. bankruptcies, during the years of easy money, you had a lot of stupid projects that got funded, and companies that are still to this day burning through cash. Now, the reality is, if by now youre not in a positive cash flow as a business, if youre not in positive cash flow when youve just had quite a few quarters of basically double-digit nominal GDP growth, plus 0% interest rates, if you cant make money in that environment, that means youre never going to make money. And in the coming year, investors are going to let you go. So youre going to see a lot of bankruptcies in the U.S., youre going to get into a bankruptcy cycle, which will mean wider corporate spreads.\n\nAnd here for me, thats if you want to be scared about something, for me, the story is pretty simple. In 2007, 2008, you had roughly 600 billion of triple B debt in the U.S., today, you have about 4 trillion of triple B debt. In the U.S., when you get to a recession, anywhere from a fifth to a quarter of that triple B debt typically gets derated to non-investment grade, now the non-investment grade market in the U.S., is around a trillion dollars. If you think that in the coming year through bankruptcies, youre going to get another trillion added to that, its like whos going to buy this because dead markets are extremely binary, if youre managing an investment grade fund, if something gets downgraded to non-investment grade, you can no longer hold it. Now historically, what you would do is you would call your friendly broker at Goldman Sachs or your friendly broker at Morgan Stanley, and you say, hey, I need to get rid of this on my book, can you guys take this from me, and you know, Goldman would bid you I dont know, 55 cents on the dollar. And youd shout at your broker, but youd have no choice. And thats what investment banks did. Their value add was to provide liquidity to the market in times of stress, they cant do that anymore, since 2008. That ability of them to bring liquidity into a stressed market has been regulated away from them.\n\nSo youre going to enter into a period of corporate bond downgrades at a time when the corporate bond market has never been bigger, with no liquidity provider anymore. And this is very specific to the U.S. because you havent had that growth of corporate debt elsewhere in the world. So I think the view that the U.S. is the cleanest dirty shirt is going to be severely, severely challenged in the coming year. Because look, youve had, again, a massive increase in corporate debt in the U.S. And thats very specific, again, to the U.S. And a lot of that debt needs to get repriced at much higher rates.\n\nMeb: Yeah. As we look at sort of U.S. economy, I mean, obviously, the interest rates ripping up and looking at you have some of my favorite charts, if we can talk you into sharing some of these, well put them in the show notes. Because you do a great job on laying this out with charts. Im a visual person, but looking at a lot of your topics. As we look out to 2023. It feels like everyones obsessed with the Fed. Does Powell pivot, is the bear market over it seems to be that youre and Im putting words in your mouth. But you would say that theres going to be more pain, as far as it comes to that view of the world. Is that accurate?\n\nLouis-Vincent: It is. And perhaps one of the slides you can share, I can bring it up if you want. But I have this table where I look at the top 10 market caps at the end of every decade, in the late 70s, six of the top 10 market caps in the world were energy stocks late 80s, eight out of 10 with Japanese stocks, late 90s eight out of 10 were telecom and Internet stocks 2000s It was all about how China was going to take over the world. And obviously the past decade, its all been about how software eats the world and you need to be in U.S. tech, etc. 10 out of the top 10 companies are tech stocks today. This has been the theme now the interesting thing when I show this table to clients they say oh yeah, the 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s Those were bubbles. But today, thats not a bubble. These guys generate great cash flows. They have quasi-monopoly situations, which gives them the ability to bully governments. Its very different this time. Theres this belief to your point, everybodys talking about the Fed pivot. Everybody you talk to says oh, well, I need to wait for the Fed to cut interest rates again.\n\nAnd then I can go back to buying Amazon and go back to buying Tesla and go back to buying Facebook. As soon as that happens. Forget it. Forget it. That bubble has now imploded. The markets already moving on to something else to me sitting around waiting all day for the Fed to cut interest rates so I can buy Facebook again, makes about as much sense as being in Tokyo in 1992. And thinking oh, when is the BOJ going to cut so I can buy bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi again? You had some great rallies in Japan through the 90s. And you know, you could trade those rallies, but you want to play the fundamental trends and not a lot of people made money, and even though you had big rallies, not a lot of people made money in Japan in the 90s because structurally, you were in a bear market. Again, bear markets are there for a reason. Were in a bear market, bear markets are there to change the leadership, the bear markets 2011, it allowed to change leadership from everythings about China to everythings about U.S. tech. For me, the bear markets were in now is telling us time to change the leadership.\n\nAnd by the way, when the Fed cuts sure youll get a rally in Facebook and in Google and everything else. But it will mark the starting gun for the massive outperformance of emerging markets. From the moment the Fed cuts, the U.S. dollar will really faceplant. This is when itll become obvious to people that actually most of the growth in the world over the next decade is going to occur in emerging markets. And this is where you need to be. So the Fed pivot does matter. And I think as you get financial accidents in the U.S. in 2023, you will see that Fed pivot, but to me, it wont be a sign of oh, lets go back to the previous winners.\n\nMeb: I mean, the illustration of Japan alone, we talked a lot about it on the show, not just because I like to ski in Japan and hopefully get to revisit this year after many years of not going and were getting a nice discount on the yen.\n\nLouis-Vincent: Very nice discount.\n\nMeb: Right. The example you give is so true. I mean, look at the 80s I mean, it was 30 years on a total return basis before that market got its head back above water. Ive been trying to tell investors, as much as I love stocks for the long run, its going to be a lot longer than you think.\n\nLouis-Vincent: Well, so interestingly, in Japan, in the 80s, a lot of the bubble was around real estate and of course, banks. If you actually strip out the banks from the index, when you got to 1989 10 of the top 10 banks in the world were Japanese. The Japanese banks alone with 25% of the world MSCI just the Japanese banks, Japan was 45% of the world MSCI. I highlight this because yes, once the bubble imploded, everything collapsed, etc. But if you strip out the banks from the index, actually, the index didnt take 30 years to make a new high, it came back pretty quickly. Because that was really the sort of central point of the bubble, right? So I highlight this because in the U.S., I think where the bubble was in tech funding any business model that was pretended to be tech, the WeWorks, the Beyond Meats, the Pelotons, all this stuff, you strip that part out. And I think the U.S. will come back very fast. Its just that tech is 30% of the benchmark now, but you strip that part out the rest because the rest of the U.S. will do okay. The one hurdle for the industrials etc. Now is the strong dollar as the strong dollar rolls over, theres no reason the John Deeres and the Caterpillars of this world cant go on going on.\n\nMeb: Well, youre speaking right to the heart of a value investor. But we talk a lot about this, we say look, a lot of the times value investing is fine. And everyone focuses on the value part youre buying cheap stocks, or youre buying an asset. But equally as important to that entire strategy is youre avoiding the really crazy expensive stuff. And the problem with market cap weighting historically has been theres no tether to value. So when you do have these giant booms, the really expensive stuff goes nuts. So Japan in the 80s, my favorite bubble U.S. late 90s. So just avoiding that sitting that out means you hopefully get to survive another day. And we talk a lot about how we think, even within the U.S. right now value or just anything other than the junk at the top can be probably a totally fine place to be. But thats one of the big weaknesses of market cap weighting. And historically why we say its fine, but not optimal for us.\n\nLouis-Vincent: And by the way on this, I think the equal cap weighted has been beating the crap out of the market cap weighted right. And thats in spite of the Apples outperformance if you did it ex Apple, it would really beat the pants out of it.\n\nMeb: Yeah, you had a great quote where you were talking basically the era coming up is going to be the return to the mean investor, where youre starting to have this reversion. As we look out, you had a great slide where youre talking about various rugby players and how they complement each other Americans we can talk about basketball team point guard, center, or whatever it may be. As we think about, you know, portfolio characteristics. Were going to probably print one of the worst traditional portfolio years ever for most stock and bond investors in the U.S. We did a poll, we said are you down on the year? And its like 90% said, yeah, and its like 90% of ETFs are down. And we look out into the future. So we got the China part in emerging markets. Anything else that we didnt talk about that you think are interesting areas to plug into the portfolio or to avoid as well?\n\nLouis-Vincent: Yeah, absolutely. So to your point, I think theres fundamentally three ways to make money in markets. You either run a return to the mean strategy, you run a momentum strategy, or you run a carry trade strategy. When you put on a trade, its very important that you know what that guy is doing for it. To your point. Its like putting a team together, right? You mentioned basketball. You dont expect your point guard to be the highest rebounder on your team. You dont expect your center to shoot a bunch of threes. I mean, if they do, its great. But thats not their job. Thats not why you put them on the court in the first place. And so as you build your portfolio, I think its very important to know, okay, if I buy this, what am I buying it for? Is this a return to the mean trade, momentum trade, carry trade, so that you can judge if hes doing their job or not? Again, youre not going to judge the point guard on his ability to rebound. I highlight this because for most people, you bought government bonds for their antifragile characteristics, you bought them thinking, well, if my equity is down 20%, then my bonds will be up 10. So thats their job. And that job has failed massively this year.\n\nThe big failure in most peoples portfolio, whether youre a pension fund, an endowment, a private investor, etc, isnt as much as equities went down 20%, thats part of the model, I would say, you buy equities, you accept that you might be down 20%, the part that has failed is that bonds havent done their job. Now, the fascinating thing to me is that we should acknowledge this, itd be like a point guard who cant shoot free throws, who went 0 for 10 at the free throw line. If youre the coach youd sub him out, its okay, you know what youre out. Youve lost it, you dont have it. But if you show up today, to whatever wealth management firm you want to show up to, theyre going to give you a nice questionnaire, and theyre going to say, oh, youre a conservative investor. So well put 60% in bond 40% in equity, oh, youre an aggressive investor, well do 60% in equity, 40% in bonds, and then you tell them hold on. This hasnt worked for two years now. But people still manage money the same way. Because its like, well, it worked for 25 years. So hopefully it goes back to working. What if it never works again? What if bonds and equities are now positively correlated, because were now in a structurally inflationary environment, then you need to completely reconsider your portfolio construction.\n\nAnd I dont think people are doing that yet. I mean, again, you still go to the wealth advisory firms, you still get the same questionnaire you were getting two years ago, and you still get broadly the same asset allocation. And theyre just sitting there crossing their fingers that the past two years were an anomaly. What if it is the new normal? What if this is now the world we live in, then you need to find different assets that are anti-fragile, different assets that protect your equity downside.\n\nNow, in an inflationary environment, you need to basically get assets that benefit from inflation, not get assets that get hurt by inflation, assets that benefit from inflation are, of course, commodities, its energy, its emerging markets, its all the things that actually did diversify your portfolio a year ago, and my portfolio, Im loaded up with energy, I have so much energy, and its not been doing well these past few weeks. But I almost dont care because Ive other stuff thats doing well, right now, most notably, all my China stuff, its ripping higher. So my China stuff is ripping higher, my energy stuff is doing badly. Its okay if tomorrow, energy prices go through the roof, my China stuff will sell off, but my energy stuff will do well, again, what would you own bonds for OECD government bonds for? Whos going to buy these from you at a higher price? For what reason? And why should portfolios still have 40%, 50% built around those? To me, those are the questions investors should be asking themselves.\n\nMeb: Yeah, I mean, always like thinking back investors to why you own an asset is such a basic, but also critical insight to work through and thinking about what role they play, and not just assuming that. I mean, bonds are such a great example, if you study history for past 100-plus years, you know, bonds dont always hedge when stocks do poorly, sometimes they do. But sometimes they show up to the Christmas party, they drink too much. And thats that, sorry. Thats who you get your crazy cousin showing up this year. As we start to wind down, whats the view you hold that say 75% plus to the vast majority of the professional investing world does not hold could be right now or it could just be all the time, anything coming to mind?\n\nLouis-Vincent: The view I would hold right now that most people dont hold is how, excuse my French, but how screwed as an asset class the OECD government bonds are and how theyve benefited from constant inflows from emerging markets. And how that is now structurally finished. A view I hold very dearly is weve completely undermined in the Western world, our single biggest comparative advantage, you know what we talked about, and that this is going to be reflected in lower and lower asset prices, especially for the asset prices that are perceived to be safe i.e. bonds in real estate. I think these two asset classes are almost condemned asset classes in the Western world. And we did this to ourselves like this is whats so infuriating, is we did this to ourselves.\n\nSo my firm belief, I guess, to sum it up is the assets you think are safe, are far less safe than you think they are and the assets that you think are unsafe, are probably much safer than you think they are. Peoples perception of safety is completely wrong. And partly because people equate safety with volatility, and if you look at periods that have countries that have gone through inflation, if you had your money in real estate or in bonds in Argentina, or in Brazil when they had big inflation, or in Zimbabwe or South Africa or wherever else, you got cleaned out, if you held equities, you actually did okay. It was volatile. But over the course of the cycle, you still did okay. So I think the view I hold dearly is actually equities. Today, given the macro environment, equities are much safer than bonds.\n\nMeb: Theres a couple comments one was, I listened to a good podcast this week called Messi Economics, but it was talking about the perspective was an Argentine reporter, and I think it was on NPR was the show note links listeners, where an Argentine reporter talked about her childhood in Argentina, and then also kind of overlaid the experience of the soccer player Messi and kind of a lot of lessons about inflation and just moving out of Argentina and the flight from massive inflation. Its a really eye-opening, I think, for a lot of investors, particularly in the U.S. who havent even thought about inflation, even at all in 30-plus years, and the vast majority of investing managers who are managing money today have never really experienced an inflationary environment. If you do, youre probably 70. And no ones listening to you anymore anyway. So youre out playing golf, but we did a post during the pandemic called the Stay Rich Portfolio. And I love to do polls on Twitter to ask people questions, and just to kind of pro-sentiment. One of them is like, what do you do with your safe money? And everyone the assumption is T-bills or bonds, right? And we said, you hit on the examples, so accurate, which is people look at that on a nominal and volatility basis.\n\nBut after inflation, we say how much do you think T-bills or bonds have declined in the past on a real drawdown basis? Most people say like zero to 10%, few crazy, say 10 to 20, you know, and the answer is over 50, right? And so you can look at, you go through a thought experiment. And what we did is we looked at a global portfolio of global stocks, global real assets, and bonds, and then you mix that in with some cash. And you cant say prove in our world, but you demonstrate, historically speaking, thats actually a safer, safe money portfolio than just sitting in T-bills and bonds, which is what everyone does, and every corporation in the world does.\n\nSo anyway, thats definitely in my non-consensus views as well. And I dont know really many people that believe that besides me, but fun thought experiment to go through. Also why theres so many yachts in Argentina, if you go down there, and various places in Latin America, if you look back on your career, what has been your most memorable investment, it could be good or bad. And you can also say, your most memorable call or position that youve had, over the years, theres going to be thousands of them, Im sure but anything come to mind?\n\nLouis-Vincent: I dont think thousands I think a career is made of three or four calls, to be honest. And if you get three or four right, youve had a pretty good career, for me, in terms of learning curve, both but also, frankly, money-making opportunity after the 2008 mortgage crisis. As a firm, we looked at the financial situation of most European countries, and we thought, the Euro is not going to be sustainable. All these European countries have had to issue massive amounts of debt to backstop their banks. And the market cant carry that much debt. So theyre going to hit the wall. So I teamed up with a very good friend of mine called Mark Hart, and we set up a fund called the European Divergence Fund. And we did two things. We bought a bunch of CDS, credit default swaps on Greece, Portugal, etc, on the premise that credit spreads would widen.\n\nAnd we bought a bunch of puts on the euro. And the premise said that the euro would tank. What was baffling was, we made a bunch of money on the credit default swaps, and we lost a bunch of money on the Euro puts because few people remember this, but basically between 2009 and 2011, the Euro went from 120 to 150. And it was very visible that Europe was hitting the wall, you know, Greece was going bankrupt, Italy was in dire straits. And as all this was happening, the Euro kept rising. I was like, What the hell is going on? Why am I getting my face ripped off over here being short, the euro, the fun in it, Im making fine because we made lots of money on the credit default swaps. But we also lost a bunch on the euro. And I was talking about it with my dad who ran a macro firm in the 80s and 90s. And he told me, you should have tried being short Japan in the 90s. Because by 1990, it was obvious that Japan had hit the wall. So he went short, the Nikkei, and he went short, the yen and the short Nikkei worked fine. And the yen went from 150 to 85 in 1994. So that means its going up. So the yen rose massively.\n\nSo in the end, you go through these episodes and you think okay, actually, when countries hit financial stress, you would think the currency would go down, but you can have a period where the currency actually shoots up as pension funds repatriate capital as banks repatriate capital as insurance companies repatriate capital, as everybody brings money back from abroad to plug the holes, and theres nobody on the other side, then the currency can just go up in a vacuum. Thats what we saw in Europe in 2010, 2011. Thats what we saw in Japan in 91, 92, 93. I highlight this because everybody looks at the U.S. dollar as a sign of strength today. But could it be a consequence of the bear market? The U.S. has just had you lose 20% on equities us 20% on bonds. If youre a U.S. pension fund if youre a U.S. insurance company, are you bringing money back to sort of plug the domestic holes and as you do. You get these parabolic moves in the currency. I look at the U.S. dollar and I wonder is this a sign of strength or a sign of weakness with things on the other side.\n\nSo for me, that was one that European divergence trade was a big thing in my career. The second big thing in my career was China, decided to basically open a bond market in 2011. I saw this as a huge opportunity for our firm, I thought, how often am I going to be in the same starting blocks as Schroeders as PIMCO as Fidelity, they have as much of a track record on Chinese printing as I do, which is none because the market didnt exist. So we built a pretty good Chinese fixed-income franchise. And we did so partly on the premise that if China was going to do this, they wanted to do it well. And our bet was that Chinese bonds would outperform most bond markets over any period. And if you look at the past 10 years, five years, three years, Chinese government bonds have outperformed U.S. Treasuries, JGBs. Because you had massive government support to that markets. And so one of the things I learned is, especially when it comes to bonds, especially when it comes to currencies, you dont want to underestimate the strength of government. Through the past 10 years, everybody was telling you, the renminbi is going to collapse cant invest in China cant invest in Chinese bonds, and it was the best-performing market.\n\nMeb: Well said, Louis, where do people find you? They want to read some of your work. Hear some more of your soothing voice, whats the best place to go?\n\nLouis-Vincent: Thank you very much. Well, the best place to go is our website.

                "cc_text": "Ukraine war: Oil prices fall back after cap on Russian crude kicks in\n\nBy Annabelle Liang & Daniel Thomas Business reporters, BBC News\n\nGetty Images\n\nOil prices initially rose, then fell back amid concerns that a new cap on the price of Russian crude could disrupt global supplies.\n\nA separate decision by major oil-producing countries to keep cutting how much they produce to prop up prices also affected prices.\n\nDespite climbing initially, the price of Brent crude ended Monday almost $3 lower a barrel at $82.68.\n\nPrices remain well below the highs seen after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nHigher oil prices tend to push up petrol prices and the cost of living which, in the UK, is rising at its fastest pace in 41 years.\n\nPrice cap\n\nOn Monday, the G7 group of major economies implemented a cap on the price of Russian oil at $60 a barrel to \"prevent Russia from profiting from its war of aggression against Ukraine\".\n\nIt will stop any Russian crude sold for more than that price from being shipped using G7 and EU tankers, insurance companies and credit institutions. Many major global shipping and insurance companies are based within the G7.\n\nHowever, Russia - which is the world's second biggest producer of crude oil - has said it will not accept the price cap and threatened to stop exporting oil to countries adopting the measures.\n\nJorge Leon, senior vice-president at Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy, told the BBC's Today programme that oil prices could increase as a result.\n\n\"Russia has been very clear that they will not sell crude [oil] to anybody signing up to the price cap,\" he said.\n\n\"So probably what's going to happen is that we will see some disruptions in the coming months and therefore probably oil prices are going to start increasing again in the coming weeks.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on Sunday the group of top oil-producing countries known as Opec+ said it would stick to its policy of reducing output to prop up global prices.\n\nOpec+ is made up of 23 oil-exporting countries, including Russia, who regularly meet to decide how much crude oil to sell on the world market.\n\nIn the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, global oil prices soared to more than $120 a barrel amid concerns about a shortfall in global supplies from Russia.\n\nBut they have fallen sharply since then as the global economy slows down and countries use less oil.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"This decision by Opec+ to keep the quota where it is... is by itself an implicit sort of support to the oil market,\" Kang Wu of S&P Global Commodity Insights told the BBC.\n\nAnalysts warned oil prices could also be impacted by the easing of Covid restrictions in some Chinese cities, leading to an increase in demand for oil.\n\nMore cities in China, including Urumqi in the north west, have said they will loosen strict lockdown rules after mass protests against the country's zero-Covid policy.\n\nThe $60 cap on Russian oil comes on top of an EU embargo on imports of Russian crude oil by sea and similar pledges by the US, Canada, Japan and the UK.\n\nBut this weekend Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky called the cap \"a weak position\" that was not \"serious\" enough to damage the Russian economy.\n\nWhile the measures will most certainly be felt by Russia, the blow will be partially softened by its move to sell its oil to other markets such as India and China, who are currently the largest single buyers of Russian crude oil.\n\nOn Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would respond to the latest measures, adding that they would not stop its military campaign in Ukraine.\n\n\"Russia and the Russian economy have the required capacity to fully meet the needs and requirements of the special military operation,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nCorrection 30 January 2023: This article has been expanded to reflect that following a rise in oil prices on the market opening, the price of Brent Crude slipped back below the starting price by the end of the day's trading.\n\nYou may also be interested in:",

                "cc_text": "December 2, 2022\n\nFollowing agreement by the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU), the members of the G7 (the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and United Kingdom) and Australia (collectively, the \"Price Cap Coalition\") are joining the EU in adopting a price cap of $60/barrel on seaborne crude oil of Russian Federation origin. The price cap is an important tool to restrict the revenue Russia receives to fund its illegal war in Ukraine, while also maintaining a reliable supply of oil onto global markets. This policy is especially critical to make oil supplies available in low- and middle-income countries hit hard by the effects of Russias war.\n\nNext week, the Price Cap Coalition will ban a broad range of servicesincluding maritime insurance and trade financerelated to the maritime transport of crude oil of Russian Federation origin (\"Russian oil\") unless purchasers buy the oil at or below $60/barrel. Importers who purchase Russian oil at or below the price cap will maintain access to an array of Coalition-country services vital to the oil trade. On February 5, 2023, this ban on services will extend to the maritime transport of Russian-origin petroleum products unless the products are sold at or below a price cap to be announced before February 5, 2023.\n\nGOALS OF THE PRICE CAP\n\nThe price cap policy is intended to maintain the supply of Russian oil to the global market while reducing the revenues the Russian Federation earns from its oil sales, particularly in light of elevated prices caused by Russias war of choice. To accomplish this goal, the EU and the other countries in the Price Cap Coalition designed the price cap to maintain the flow of Russian oil at a discounted price.\n\nThe price cap will be of particular benefit to emerging markets and low-income economies that are highly exposed to rising energy prices. Russias unconscionable war in Ukraine has disrupted energy markets and caused widespread economic hardship, from natural gas shortages in Europe to elevated oil prices around the globe. The rise in energy prices has proven especially harmful to those economies with heightened vulnerability to energy price shocks. These economies are well-positioned to benefit from the price caps stabilizing effect on prices for two reasons. First, countries in the Price Cap Coalition, are already committed to prohibiting or phasing out imports of Russian oil and will not directly benefit from a lower price. Accordingly, it is prospective buyers elsewhereespecially emerging marketsthat stand to gain directly from low-cost Russian oil. Second, emerging market and low-income economies are generally more exposed to price shocks than advanced economies. The price cap therefore particularly benefits importers from these countries by helping stabilize global oil prices.\n\nHOW THE PRICE CAP WORKS\n\nThe price caps operation depends on a vital element of the global oil trade: the maritime services industry, which includes insurance, trade finance, and other key services that support the complex transport of oil around the globe. Traders, brokers, and importers rely on these services to protect and finance their trade, and vessel-owners rely on insurance to protect their ships. Moreover, almost all ports and major canals require ships to carry protection and indemnity insurance. Companies based in the G7 control around 90 percent of the market for relevant maritime insurance products and reinsurance. The price cap works by allowing access to these critical services from Coalition-country providers for Russian oil only if that oil is purchased at or below the cap.\n\nThe price cap works by creating an exception from upcoming restrictions on the use of maritime services. We know the status quowhere Russia can trade freely at levels near prevailing market prices, which have been elevated by Russias invasionis not acceptable, but we are also committed to supporting stability in global energy markets. The price cap policy should be regarded as a complement to the implementation of forthcoming EU sanctions announced in June 2022, to encourage stable energy supplies. The price cap is structured as an exception to those restrictions, allowing companies based in Coalition countries to provide services related to the maritime transport of Russian oil trade only if the oil is traded at or below $60/barrel. This approach relies on the G7s dominant role in the maritime services industry. Once the price cap is in place, any importer of Russian oil that pays a price above the cap will have to do so using services exclusively from companies outside the Coalitionwhich represent only a fraction of the market and are often more expensive and less reliable.\n\nWe know the status quowhere Russia can trade freely at levels near prevailing market prices, which have been elevated by Russias invasionis not acceptable, but we are also committed to supporting stability in global energy markets.

The level of the price cap, $60/barrel, is set high enough to maintain a clear economic incentive for Russia to continue selling oil on global markets. This price is set at a level that Russia has historically accepted, which is above its cost of production and comparable with prices Russia sold at prior to its war in Ukraine. Russia has multiple options to respond to the price cap. Russia can sell at or below the price cap and keep its oil flowing onto global markets, at lower prices for importers and with the benefit of best-in-class G7 services. Alternatively, Russia can rely on non-G7 service providers, which are limited in scale, more expensive, and less reliable. Given these constraints, reducing the volume of sales would not be in Russias economic interest, especially because doing so would mean reducing sales to key emerging markets, including Russian allies. The Coalition will review and, if necessary, adjust the price cap based on Coalition objectives and market fundamentals. The Coalition will continue to engage with market participants to help ensure updates do not introduce volatility and are practical to implement (including assessing feasible timelines for implementation).\n\nThis price is set at a level that Russia has historically accepted, which is above its cost of production and comparable with prices Russia sold at prior to its war in Ukraine.\n\nCOMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK\n\nThe price cap policy establishes a \"safe harbor\" for G7 service providers that comply with a simple recordkeeping and attestation process, designed to allow each party in the supply chain of Russian oil shipped via maritime transport to demonstrate or confirm that the Russian oil has been purchased at or below the price cap. On November 22, 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued guidance on the U.S. implementation of the price cap policy for Russian crude oil. As this guidance makes clear, this \"safe harbor\" for service providers through the recordkeeping and attestation process is designed to shield such service providers from strict liability for breach of sanctions in cases where service providers inadvertently deal in the purchase of Russian oil sold above the price cap owing to falsified or erroneous records provided by those who act in bad faith or make material misrepresentations. The U.S. government anticipates working with other members of the Coalition to enforce the price cap, including by sharing information.",

                "cc_text": "Quick Notes\n\nNon-Fossil Fuels in Power Generation: Mitigation at the Expense of Adaptation?\n\nBackground\n\nIndias updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) contained two energy related quantitative commitments: (i) to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP (gross domestic product) by 45 percent by 2030, from its 2005 level and (ii) to achieve about 50 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, with the help of the transfer of technology and low-cost international finance, including from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Increasing the share of non-fossil fuel based installed capacity by 50 percent by 2030 is within the scope of \"business-as-usual\" growth trajectory but will mean greater pressure on Indias meagre public finances.\n\nStatus\n\nAs of October 2022, installed capacity for power generation was about 408,714 megawatts (MW) out of which coal accounted for 210,605 MW or just over 51 percent, renewable energy (RE) accounted for 119,092.59 MW or about 29 percent followed by 46,850 MW of hydro which accounted for about 11 percent of capacity. Natural gas accounted for 6 percent of installed capacity with 24,824 MW and nuclear accounted for 1.7 percent of capacity with 6780 MW. A total of about 172,723 MW of non-fossil fuel based installed capacity accounted for just over 42 percent of total installed capacity for power generation as of October 2022.\n\nThe report on Indias long-term low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategies (LTLEDS) released at COP27 in 2022 does not mention any new quantitative target for RE (wind, solar etc) other than what it has already communicated but it clearly states that Indias installed capacity for nuclear power generation will be tripled by 2030. The existing nuclear power capacity of 6780 MW is projected to touch 22480 MW by the year 2031 on progressive completion of projects under construction and projects that have been sanctioned. In the case of hydro 79 hydro projects with an aggregate capacity of more than 30000 MW including 11 pumped storage schemes of 8700 MW are expected to come online by 2030. This includes just over 12,663 MW of hydro projects under construction and 5 projects with a capacity of 1023 MW that have been commissioned.\n\nTrends\n\nFossil fuels, mainly coal, accounted for over 62.7 percent of the installed capacity of power generation in 1947 and hydro-power, the only non-fossil fuel accounted for 37.30 percent. The highest share of 71.16 percent for an installed capacity of fossil-fuel based power generation was in 2002 with non-fossil fuel-based power generation recording its lowest share of 28.84 percent. The lowest share for fossil fuel-based power generation capacity was in 1969 when it accounted for 54.36 percent of total generation capacity while non-fossil fuels (hydro and nuclear) accounted for the highest share of 45.64 percent. In terms of generation, the highest share of non-fossil fuel-based power generation was in 1947 when it accounted for over 53 percent of generation. The lowest was in 2002 when non-fossil fuel-based generation accounted for 16 percent of the generation. Since then, the share of non-fossil fuel-based generation is increasing primarily on account of RE. In 2022 non-fossil fuels accounted for just over 24 percent of generation.\n\nFuture Projections\n\nThe draft national electricity plan (NEP) expects installed capacity to increase to 865,941 MW by 2032. The largest capacity addition of 214,020 MW is expected from RE with about 69 percent contributed by solar photovoltaics (PV). Offshore wind power generation capacity of about 10,000 MW is expected to come on stream by 2032. Overall, RE is expected to account for about 60 percent of power generation capacity by 2032 estimated at 516,361 MW. The share of coal-based power generation capacity is expected to fall to 28.3 percent in 2032. No additional gas-based power generation capacity is expected after 2027 and the share of natural gas in power generation is expected to fall to just 2.9 percent by 2032. With 68,641.17 MW the share of hydropower is also expected to fall to 7.9 percent by 2032. Projections for nuclear power are optimistic with an additional capacity of 15,000 MW coming onstream by 2032. This will increase nuclear power generation capacity to 22,480 MW and its share in total power generation capacity is expected to increase to 2.5 percent. Total power generation is expected to increase to 865,941 TWh (terawatt hour) by 2032 in which coal is projected to account for the largest share of 1333.8 TWh or about 50 percent. Generation from RE is expected to touch 938 TWh equivalent to 34.8 percent of generation. Generation from hydropower of 231.8 TWh is expected to account for 8.7 percent of total generation in 2032. Generation of 134 TWh of power from nuclear generators is projected to increase to 5 percent of total generation.\n\nIssues\n\nIn 1947, the share of non-fossil fuel-based capacity (only hydro) was about 37 percent but its share in generation was over 53 percent. As per projections by the draft NEP, the share of non-fossil fuel based installed capacity for power generation is expected to increase to over 71 percent by 2032 but the share of non-fossil fuels in power generation is expected to touch only 47 percent by 2032 even under optimistic assumptions. The share of RE (primarily wind and solar) alone is expected to account for over 60 percent of installed capacity but its share in generation is expected to touch only 34 percent. This underscores the challenge of low capacity factors of new RE sources. This means greater investment in capacity is required to produce one unit of power from RE sources than from non-RE sources.\n\nPublic finance has so far played a key role in supporting broader finance flows towards increasing the shares of RE electricity and electrification. Policies that increase the costs of fossil fuels through high taxes to support RE investment would imply a higher cost of living, which may require either subsidies or recycling of public revenues back into the economy through various support schemes. In the case of power supply, the \"must-run\" status of RE has led to significantly increased costs for distribution companies. Public sector distribution companies bear the cost of policies that seek to increase electricity access to the poor and renewable purchase obligations (RPO) add to their costs. This excludes other socialisation of RE costs that are borne elsewhere in the system, including support like free inter-state transmission and other substantial system balancing costs.\n\nSuch support from public finance has increased since 2014 and is likely to increase further as new production linked incentives are announced for production of RE technologies. This is an issue that requires a place in the dominant narrative of RE power being cheaper than traditional fossil and non-fossil energy sources. Scarce public resources are being spent on increasing the production and consumption of RE. Mitigation or increasing the share of RE should not come at the cost of adaptation or development of the poor.\n\nMonthly News Commentary: Natural Gas\n\nIndia Auctions Offshore Oil & Gas Blocks\n\nIndia\n\nProduction\n\nIndia is offering 26 blocks or areas for finding and producing oil and gas in a mega offshore bid round, upstream regulator DGH (Directorate General of Hydrocarbons) said. Simultaneously, 16 areas for prospecting for coal-bed methane (CBM) are also being offered in a separate round. Out of the 26 blocks, 15 areas are in ultra-deepwater, 8 in the shallow sea and 3 blocks are on land. The bid rounds are being held under the 2016 policy, called the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP), which was promulgated on 30 March 2016. DGH said the 16 CBM blocks being offered in the special bid round are spread over Madhya Pradesh (4), Chhattisgarh, Telangana (3 each), Maharashtra, Odisha (2 each), Jharkhand and West Bengal (1 each).\n\nReliance Industries Limited (RIL) will commission its deepwater MJ gas condensate field in Bay of Bengal block KG-D6 by year end, boosting natural gas output to 30 percent of Indias total. MJ is the third and last of a set of discoveries that RIL and its partner BP are developing in the eastern offshore block. The two will use a floating production system at the high sea in the Bay of Bengal to bring to production the deepest gas discovery in the KG-D6 block. RIL and BP are spending around US$5 billion (bn) on three separate development projects in the KG-D6 block R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster, and MJ which together are expected to produce around 30 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of natural gas by 2023. R-Cluster started production in December 2020 and the Satellite Cluster came onstream in April last year. While the R-Cluster has a plateau gas production of about 12.9 mmscmd, the Satellite Cluster will have a peak output of 6 mmscmd. The MJ field will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd. Combined gas output from R-Cluster and Satellite Cluster stood at more than 19 mmscmd during July-September. RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 the largest two were brought into production in April 2009, and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put into production in September 2008. While the MA field stopped producing in 2019, the output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February 2020. Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production. MJs reservoirs are about 2000 metres below the D1-D3 gas fields.\n\nLNG\n\nIndian Oil Corporation (IOC) is in talks with US (United States) energy firm Tellurian Inc for a long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply deal as well as an equity investment in the latters Driftwood project. IOC has grand ambitions in the natural gas segment but turmoil in the international market has made it harder for it to source affordable LNG. Indian Oil, Petronet LNG and GAIL (India) Limited are all seeking long-term contracts but have been unable to lay their hands on any deal that can bring supplies ahead of 2026 when large global liquefaction capacity is expected to come onstream, easing the current crunch. IOC has begun discussions with Tellurian but is yet to agree on the volume or the equity investment in the Driftwood LNG project.\n\nCGD/CNG\n\nIndraprastha Gas Ltd, which retails compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped cooking gas in the national capital and adjoining cities, reported a 4 percent rise in its September quarter net profit as a rise in input natural gas prices hurt margins. The net profit stood at INR4.16 bn (US$50.98 mn) in July-September compared with INR4 bn in the same period a year back. Gas prices have doubled since Russia invaded Ukraine. IGLs expense on the purchase of natural gas soared from INR9.29 bn (US$113.84 mn) in July-September 2021 to INR26.10 bn (US$319.84 mn) in the current year. The firm registered an overall sales volume growth of 12 percent over the corresponding quarter in the last fiscal, with the average daily sale going up from 7.24 mmscmd to 8.09 mmscmd. Product wise, CNG recorded sales volume growth of 15 percent, while piped natural gas (PNG) recorded sales volume growth of 3 percent in the quarter as compared to the corresponding quarter last year.\n\nAfter a relief for a brief period, CNG has once again become more expensive than petrol in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. This happened for the second time but in total it was the fifth hike in the current financial year. Now the consumer must pay INR97 per kg (kilogram) for CNG in Lucknow, Agra and Unnao, which was INR95 per kg earlier. Similarly in Ayodhya, the vehicle owner has to pay INR 98.45 per kg, which is INR96.45 per kg. The current petrol price in Lucknow is INR 96.57 per litre, while diesel is sold in retail at INR 89.91 per litre. In April, CNG retail cost was INR 84.25 per kg.\n\nGas Trade\n\nChief Minister (CM) M K Stalin inaugurated Tamil Nadus first liquefied, compressed natural gas (LCNG) station set up by AG & P Pratham near Manthangal village in Ranipet district. The new facility would transform Ranipet and Vellore districts and surrounding areas into a gas-based ecosystem and fuel industrial growth. The company is developing city gas distribution networks in six districts Kancheepuram, Chengalpet, Vellore, Ranipet, Tirupattur and Ramanathapuram besides South-East Chennai. The company has launched 27 CNG stations in Kancheepuram and Chengalpet districts and South-East Chennai, three in Ramanathapuram district and 14 in Vellore and Ranipet districts. The company plans to launch 22 more CNG stations in the state by March 2023. The company is working aggressively at the grassroots level to realize the governments vision of migrating towards a gas-based economy. The company has authorizations to develop CGD networks across 12 geographical areas covering 34 districts across 8 percent of India and 64 million people in the states of Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. In its 12 geographical areas, the company is developing and operating CNG stations for vehicles, and piped natural gas to homes, industries and commercial establishments.\n\nPolicy & Governance\n\nPunjab Director General of Police (DGP) Gaurav Yadav, who is also the chairman of the Onshore Security Coordination Committee (OSCC), assured complete assistance and support from the Punjab Police to the Oil and Gas Companies to ensure the security and safety of oil and gas, which are vital national assets. The DGP, chairing the third OSCC meeting organised by GAIL (India) Limited in Chandigarh, reviewed the safety measures in place for security of oil installations in the state. A number of issues such as the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), scaling up of security, keeping vigil via CCTVs and Drone Surveillance were discussed during the meeting, which was aimed at effective coordination between the stakeholders. DGP Yadav said that although Punjab has been secure so far, the Police and Oil-Gas Companies need to be alert and aware all the time and should work together for the safety of the oil and gas. He also stressed the need to hold district level security coordination meetings for greater synergy between oil-gas companies and district police.\n\nRest of the World\n\nEurope\n\nA gas pipeline is to be built connecting Iberia to France and the rest of Europe, Spanish Prime Minister (PM) Pedro Sanchez has confirmed. Spain, France and Portugal have agreed to cooperate on the project. Sanchez said that the pipeline will hugely increase the volume of the two existing links between Spain and France. It will also help to transport green hydrogen and gas during the transition period Europe needs until it increases its capacity for renewables. Spain has spent several months pushing for the project, which is also supported by Germany. As well as its Algerian pipeline, Spain also has a high capacity for converting LNG, with 6 LNG terminals.\n\nGermany has called for European Union (EU) states to work with countries that can develop new gas fields, prompting concern from campaigners over the climate change commitments of Europes biggest economy as it scrambles to replace Russian gas. EU leaders are meeting to debate new measures to tame high energy prices and plug the gap caused by plummeting deliveries of Russian gas a response that Brussels has said should speed up, rather than slow, Europes shift to green energy. Germany is racing to find alternatives to Russian fossil fuels both by expanding renewable energy faster and importing more non-Russian gas. Russia supplied more than half of Germanys gas before Moscow invaded Ukraine.\n\nIberian wholesale market gas prices extended steep declines, with the day-ahead contract falling for the first time below the 40 euros per megawatt-hour (MWh) cap set in May for gas-fired power plants., after the national grid operator warned it may reject LNG shipments due to overcapacity. The price decline comes after Spains national gas operator Enagas warned it may have to reject shipments of LNG due to overcapacity at its six terminals. Dozens of ships carrying LNG are circling off the coasts of Spain and other countries in Europe, unable to secure slots to unload because of a lack of regasification capacity, with plants that convert the fuel back to gas operating at full capacity. Portugal has warned that recent floods there could affect the supply of LNG, while low levels of rainfall in Iberia could further stymie hydroelectric production and mount pressure on electricity suppliers to produce their energy using gas.\n\nDamage to the Nord Stream gas pipeline from Russia to Europe was caused by powerful explosions, Danish police said, echoing earlier findings into leaks that erupted in the network under the Baltic Sea and that have been blamed on sabotage. Dwindling flows of gas from Russia, which once supplied 40 percent of Europes needs, have left the EU struggling to unite over how to respond to surging prices that have deepened a cost-of-living crisis for families and businesses. The European Commission proposed a package of emergency measures to tackle high energy prices, including for EU states to start jointly buying gas. But it avoided proposing an immediate price cap on gas amid splits over the idea.\n\nThe Czech Republic and Germany are close to reaching an agreement on sharing gas in times of emergency, Czech Industry Minister Jozef Sikela said, as the countries seek to bolster energy security amid dwindling supplies of Russian gas. Bilateral pacts are a part of the European Unions plans to cope with any gas supply shock, although deals have been slow to materialise. As per the Minister, the two countries had defined conditions under which they would start sharing gas as well as what compensation the Czech Republic would pay Germany for use of the mechanism, without disclosing further details. Germany had been a large destination and transit country for Russian gas supplies before Moscow began reducing exports to the European Union in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions from Brussels.\n\nEU leaders meeting will explore a range of options for gas price caps, over which they have been divided for weeks, according to a new draft of conclusions for the 20-21 October summit. The EUs 27 countries have been deadlocked for weeks over whether and how to cap gas prices as part of efforts to tame soaring energy prices, as Europe heads into a winter of scarce Russian gas, a cost of living crisis and a possible recession. Gas prices have soared as Russia slashed flows to Europe following its invasion of Ukraine and the Western sanctions imposed on it prompting most EU countries to call for a gas price cap, although they disagree on its design.\n\nAccording to French grid operator GRTgaz, Germany received the first direct gas deliveries from France through a pipeline link under a deal aimed at helping both countries cope with current energy supply problems. The operator mentioned that France, which is less exposed to Russian imports than its eastern neighbour as most of its needs are filled from Norway and through LNG deliveries, will at first deliver 31 gigawatt hours (GWh) per day, using a pipeline in the Moselle region. The maximum capacity of the new gas link is 100 GWh/d.\n\nSpains cabinet approved a new energy-saving plan which aims to cut the countrys natural gas consumption by up to 13.5 percent by March as part of Europes efforts to reduce its dependence on Russian supplies. The plan also calls on Spain to increase its capacity to export gas to other European Union member states. It includes measures to increase by 18 percent Spains ability to send gas by pipeline to France across the Pyrenees mountain range, and an expansion in loading capacity for boats carrying gas to other EU countries, among them Italy. The EU has asked member states to cut gas use from August to March by up to 15 percent, although for some countries less exposed to Russian energy dependence the figure is lower, as in the case of Spain, which agreed to cut use by 7.0 percent. But under the new energy-saving plan approved, Spain aims to reduce its gas consumption by between 5.1 percent and up to 13.5 percent during this period.\n\nAccording to Technology and Industry Minister Laszlo Palkovics, Hungary, one of the EUs most-reliant members on Russian energy, aims to eliminate Russian gas imports by 2050 through a large-scale electrification driveUnder a 15-year deal signed last year, before the start of the war in neighbouring Ukraine, Hungary receives 4.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year via Bulgaria and Serbia under a long-term deal with Russia. In July, nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbans government scrapped a years-long cap on utility prices for higher-usage households, which Palkovics said would likely contribute to a decline in retail gas consumption. Palkovics said the government would review Hungarys energy strategy in the first quarter of 2023, looking to curb gas reliance and boost electricity production relying on nuclear and solar energy as well as a possible move towards wind farms. As per the minister, households, which used 4 bcm of gas last year, would likely cut consumption by at least 800 million cubic metres after subsidies were curbed, with more savings coming from government measures to limit consumption. As a first step, Hungary aims to reduce the share of gas in its total energy consumption to 26 percent by 2030 from 35 percent last year, a decline of about 2.4 bcm, Palkovics said.\n\nRomanian natural gas storage facilities have been filled above a targeted 80 percent capacity and could reach 90 percent by 1 November. Unlike other countries in the region, Romania relies less on Russian gas. It produces about 90 percent of its required gas locally through state producer Romgaz, oil and gas group OMV Petrom and Black Sea Oil & Gas. BSOG, controlled by private equity firm Carlyle Group, launched its offshore gas platform in Romanian waters of the Black Sea earlier this year. The potential for further gas discoveries in Romanias Black Sea is huge, but the government needs to improve regulation to speed development, the countrys top gas producers said in September. Romania has also met its European Union-mandated storage target but could still need gas imports this winter.\n\nAccording to Energy Minister Roberto Cingolani, Italy will be able to get through the winter with existing gas storage and flow levels unless there are \"catastrophic events.\" Energy group Eni, the biggest importer of Russian gas in Italy, said that it would not receive any of the gas it had ordered for delivery, and expected this situation to last. The disruption added to tensions caused by leaks found last week in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines linking Russia and Germany, which both the Kremlin and the West blamed on sabotage.\n\nGreece and Bulgaria started a commercial operation of a long-delayed gas pipeline which will help decrease southeast Europes dependence on Russian gas and boost energy security. The 182-km pipeline will provide relief to Bulgaria, which has been struggling to secure gas supplies at affordable prices since the end of April, when Russias Gazprom cut off deliveries over Sofias refusal to pay in roubles. Russia has decreased its gas deliveries to Europe after the West imposed sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, leaving European Union countries scrambling to secure alternative supplies amid surging prices. The Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria (IGB) pipeline will transport 1 bcm of Azeri gas to Bulgaria. With an initial capacity of 3 bcm per year and plans to later raise this to 5 bcm, the pipeline could provide non-Russian gas to neighbouring Serbia, North Macedonia, Romania and further to Moldova and Ukraine. It will carry gas from the northern Greek city of Komotini to Stara Zagora in Bulgaria. IGB is linked to another pipeline, part of the Southern Gas Corridor that carries Azeri gas to Europe. Gas operators in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia proposed to transport increased Azeri shipments through their networks to central Europe. The 240 million (US$235.18 million) pipeline is controlled by a joint venture between Bulgarian state energy company BEH, Greek gas utility DEPA and Italys Edison.\n\nA rush to secure natural gas is resulting in an acute shortage of seaborne vessels, forcing companies to pay record-high rates to transport the fuel to Europe. The continent is racing to replace Russian pipeline flows with LNG from suppliers including in the US and Nigeria. But there are few ships available through the rest of the year, presenting a new risk to the global gas supply this winter. Buyers are snapping up all available vessels as demand for gas increases with winter approaching, and refraining from releasing any back into the market in case theyre needed for any supply at short notice. Shell Plc booked the Yiannis to load a US cargo at the end of October for delivery to Europe at a rate equivalent to US$400,000 per day on a round-trip basis, said traders. The deal is likely the most expensive ever for the Atlantic basin, according to traders and brokers.\n\nAfrica\n\nMozambique expects to ship its first liquefied natural gas exports to Europe from the Eni-operated Coral Sul floating plant later this month or early November, petroleum regulator INP said in a supply boost for the energy-starved region. BPs LNG tanker, British Sponsor, has already arrived offshore northern Mozambique, said Welligence Energy Analytics in a note, with all of Coral Suls annual gas output of 3.4 million tonnes (MT) contracted to BP for 20 years on a free-on-board basis. The new LNG cargoes will help alleviate a tight global LNG market and gas shortages in Europe as winter looms following Moscows February invasion of Ukraine and Russias later decision to curb gas pipeline supplies into major European Union economies. As part of its exploration activity offshore Mozambique, Eni discovered the Coral South gas field in 2012 and took its final investment decision in 2017, pledging to start producing gas using a floating LNG plant after five years.\n\nAccording to Portugals oil and gas company Galp Energia, it may face additional sourcing disruptions after Nigeria LNG declared force majeure due to widespread flooding. Galp Energia said it had received a notice from Nigeria LNG, its main natural gas supplier, about the force majeure but said \"no information was provided to support an assessment of potential impacts\". The declaration of force majeure could worsen Nigerias cash crunch and will curtail global gas supplies as Europe and others struggle to replace Russian exports due to the invasion of Ukraine in February. Portugals Environment and Energy Minister Duarte Cordeiro said the southern European nation could face supply problems this winter if Nigeria does not deliver all the LNG it is due to. Last year, Portugal imported 2.8 bcm of LNG from Nigeria, or 49.5 percent of total imports, while the US was the second-largest supplier with a share of 33.3 percent.\n\nNigeria will award contracts for its flared gas by the end of December under an accelerated programme to harness gas that is released as a by-product of oil production, the countrys petroleum regulator said. President Muhammadu Buhari first launched the programme to auction rights to capture and sell flared gas in 2016. In 2020 the government approved 200 bidders but the process was stalled due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The government has said that flaring costs roughly US$1 bn a year in lost revenue. The gas can be used in power plants, in industry or exported. Petroleum Minister Timipre Sylva said Nigerias plan to commercialise gas burned from its oil fields was at an advanced stage and would help cut 15 MT of carbon emissions from the atmosphere. Nigeria, which has Africas largest gas reserves of more than 190 trillion cubic feet, first targeted gas flaring in the late 1970s and, through various schemes and regulations, has more than halved it since 2001.\n\nMiddle East\n\nEgypt is aiming to take over the development of Gazas offshore natural gas field, in what would be a boost for the cash-strapped Palestinian economy. While Egypt and Israel have been producing gas in the eastern Mediterranean for years, the Gaza Marine field, about 30 km (20 miles) off the Gaza coast, has remained undeveloped due to political disputes and conflict with Israel, as well as economic factors. The project was last in the hands of oil major Shell, which gave up its stake in 2018. The Palestinians have been looking for a new foreign group to take over. Egypts gas company EGAS began talks last year with the Palestine Investment Fund PIF and the Consolidated Contractors Company CCC, a coalition of companies that are licensed to develop the field.\n\nNorth and South America\n\nAccording to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), natural gas prices at major US trading hubs for the upcoming winter are expected to remain higher than in recent years. Freeport LNG, the second-largest US LNG (liquefied natural gas) export plant, idled for five months by fire, must receive full approvals before a planned November restart can begin, regulators said. FERC said it sees the Henry Hub natural gas futures contract price averaging US$6.82 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu) for winter 2022-2023, up 30 percent from last winters settled price. US natural gas futures are currently trading just under US$5.3 per mmBtu, their lowest levels in about seven months.\n\nUS oil major Chevron Corporation expects high European prices for liquefied natural gas to attract a majority of US LNG exports in the short term. Europe is determined to wean itself off Russian gas imports following its invasion of Ukraine, a move that has thrown open the door to US suppliers. Its commitment to building import terminals and regasification facilities shows the regions demand for US exports could last. Chevron is a large natural gas producer globally, last year pumping more than 7.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) with more than half of its gas production in the US and Australia. The major producer produces LNG in Australia and Angola and recently carved out a foothold in US LNG through purchase agreements with LNG producers Cheniere Energy Inc and closely-held Venture Global LNG. The US is the worlds top gas producer with an output near 99 bcfd, but as consumption is lower, at about 89 bcfd, there is room for rising exports with expanding production. Chevron is also studying options to \"commercialise\" more gas from an Eastern Mediterranean field, off the coast of Israel, either through existing pipelines or some LNG alternatives.\n\nChina\n\nChina has asked its state-owned gas importers to stop reselling LNG to buyers in Europe and Asia as it seeks to ensure its own supply for the winter season. Chinas National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has asked PetroChina Co, Sinopec and Cnooc Ltd to keep winter cargoes for domestic use. Chinese authorities said the country would greatly increase domestic energy supply capacity and its reserve capacity for key commodities, reiterating a policy of ensuring supplies and stabilising prices of raw materials.\n\nRest of Asia-Pacific\n\nMalaysias Petronas said it has declared force majeure on gas supply to one of its liquefaction terminals, Malaysia LNG Dua, due to a pipeline leak caused by soil movement at the Sabah-Sarawak Gas Pipeline. Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corporation, which owns a stake in Malaysia LNG, said that Malaysia LNG, majority owned by Petronas, had declared force majeure on LNG supplies to its customers following the pipeline leak. Petronas said that the pipeline leak had affected its delivery commitments to some of its contracted LNG buyers, and the company was in discussions to \"identify suitable mitigation efforts\". It was also conducting an evaluation of the Sabah-Sarawak Gas Pipeline to ensure its integrity and safety. With a total LNG capacity of 25.7 million tonnes per annum, the Malaysia LNG project is one of the largest LNG facilities in a single location in the world, according to Mitsubishi.\n\nNews Highlights: 26 October 1 November 2022\n\nNational: Oil\n\nVedanta gets 10-year extension for Rajasthan oil block\n\n27 October: Vedanta has got a 10-year extension of the licence for its prolific Rajasthan oil block till 14 May 2030, the firm said. The initial licence to explore and produce oil and gas from the Barmer block expired on 14 May 2020. The government had agreed to a 10-year extension but it wanted a higher share of oil and gas from the block as well as a settlement of INR 56.51 bn dispute over cost recovery for the same. The government has agreed to sign the extension of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) pending the settlement of the dispute. The company produced 1,20,805 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the second quarter ended 30 September 2022. The block, with 38 discoveries, till date, has a total in place hydrocarbons of 5.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe). The block has cumulatively produced more than 700 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) in the last decade. Vedanta believes it is eligible for an automatic extension of PSC for the Rajasthan (RJ) block on the same terms with effect from 15 May 2020. The government had in October 2018 agreed to extend by 10 years the contract for Barmer fields in Rajasthan after the expiry of the initial 25-year contract period on 14 May 2020.\n\nIndias Russian oil binge sends Middle East imports to 19-month low\n\n27 October: Indias oil imports from the Middle East fell to a 19-month low in September while Russian imports rebounded although refining outages hit overall crude imports, trade and shipping data showed. Indias total oil imports in September fell to a 14-month low of 3.91 million barrels per day (bpd), down 5.6 percent from a year earlier, due to maintenance at refiners such as Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the data showed. Indias imports from the Middle East fell to about 2.2 million bpd, down 16.2 percent from August, the data showed, while imports from Russia increased 4.6 percent to about 896,000 bpd after dipping in the previous two months. Russias share of Indias oil imports surged to an all-time high of 23 percent from 19 percent the previous month while that of the Middle East declined to 56.4 percent from 59 percent, the data showed. Imports for Saudi Arabia fell to a three-month low of about 758,000 bpd, down 12.3 percent from August, while imports from Iraq plunged to 948,400 bpd, their lowest level in a year, the data showed. In the first half of this fiscal year, Indian refiners also reduced purchases of African oil, mostly bought from the spot market. However, supply from the Middle East rose from a low base last year when the second wave of the coronavirus cut fuel demand.\n\nNational: Gas\n\nIndias imports of natural gas, oil to zoom by 2030: IEA\n\n28 October: The International Energy Agency (IEA) said that Indias import of natural gas will double and that of oil will rise 50 percent by 2030 due to soaring domestic demand while production remains subdued. The IEA stated that demand for natural gas in the country would nearly double to 115 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2030 from 66 bcm in 2021, with most of the growth coming from manufacturing and other industry. The agency estimates domestic production of natural gas to rise 50 percent to 48 bcm in 2030, which would be lower than Indias output of 51 bcm in 2010. The global demand for natural gas rises at an average rate of 0.4 percent per year between 2021 and 2030, lower than the 2.2 percent growth rate between 2010 and 2021. The demand is expected to reach 4,400 bcm in 2030 and stay at that level until 2050.\n\nNational: Coal\n\nChhattisgarh government seeks cancellation of forest clearance for Parsa coal block\n\n1 November: The Chhattisgarh government has written to the Union environment ministry seeking cancellation of the forest approval given to Parsa coal block in Hasdeo Arand forest, citing the \"law and order\" problem and the overall benefit of the locals in the area. The coal from Parsa is meant for the thermal power plants in Rajasthan, another Congress ruled state. The Parsa coal block has been allocated to the Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RRVUNL) while coal mine developer-cum-operator (MDO) operations have been awarded to the Adani Enterprises through competitive bidding.\n\nCoal India production increases 17 percent in April-October to 352 MT\n\n1 November: Coal India Limited (CIL) said its coal production increased by 17.4 percent to 351.9 million tonnes (MT) in the April-October period of the ongoing fiscal. The companys coal output in the corresponding period of last fiscal was 299.6 MT, CIL said. However, in October the offtake dropped to 53.7 MT from 56.5 MT in the same month of last fiscal. The coal major did not give the reason for the drop in offtake. CIL accounts for over 80 percent of domestic coal output. CIL will achieve 1 billion tonnes of coal production target by 2025-26 as against the earlier timeline of 2023-24 in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, coal minister Pralhad Joshi had said. Coal output by CIL in the current financial year is expected to be 700 MT and there would be additional output of 200 MT from other sources.\n\nNational: Power\n\nIndias power consumption grows marginally to 114.6 bn units in October\n\n1 November: Indias power consumption grew 1.64 percent to 114.64 billion units in October in contrast to the year-ago interval, according to authorities information. The energy consumption rose solely marginally in October, primarily due to incessant unseasonal rains which stored the mercury ranges low and decreased the usage of cooling home equipment. The farmers use electricity to run tube wells for irrigation for brand new crops. The peak power demand met, which is the very best provided in a day, in October rose to 186.90 gigawatt (GW). The peak energy supply stood at 174.44 GW in October 2021 and 169.89 GW in October 2020. The peak energy demand met was 164.25 GW in October 2019, which was the pre-pandemic interval. Electricity consumption in October 2019 stood at 97.84 billion units. Experts opined that the marginal development in power consumption in October doesnt lead to sluggish restoration in the financial system because it has occurred simply due to unseasonal rains which affected demand of electrical energy quickly.\n\nUP discoms claimed that they charged INR40 mn extra from power consumers\n\n1 November: The five discoms (distribution companies) of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) stated to the Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC), that they have charged more than INR40.1 mn extra from power consumers for new connections. Earlier on 21 October, the discoms had presented a figure of merely INR22.7 mn. PVVNL (Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited) said that discom charged INR 37.49 lakh excessive from consumers and would complete the refund in next 15 days.\n\nIndustrial units under RIPS to get electricity duty exemption\n\n30 October: The Rajasthan government has approved a proposal to give exemption from electricity duty to industrial units under the Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme-2022. Chief Minister (CM) Ashok Gehlot has approved the proposal to give exemption in electricity duty to the beneficiaries of Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme-2022 (RIPS-2022). With this approval of CM, the units involved in RIPS-2022 will be able to get exemption in electricity duty on the electricity used by them. The units will be able to get the benefit of the said exemption as per the rules of the RIPS-2022 scheme. The RIPS-2022 scheme has been started recently by the CM to provide a better environment for proper development and investment of industries in the state.\n\nAlmost 30 percent power consumers yet to apply for monthly electricity subsidy: Delhi Government\n\n28 October: Nearly 30 percent of the electricity consumers and subsidy beneficiaries are yet to apply for the power subsidy even as the last date of application, 31 October, inches closer, the government said. According to the government, over 33 lakh electricity consumers have so far applied for the power subsidy in the national capital. Delhi Chief Minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal had announced 31 October as the deadline to apply for power subsidy for the month. He had said that those who do not apply for the subsidy will have to pay their non-subsidised bills but can apply next month. There are 58 lakh domestic power consumers in Delhi, of whom 47 lakh avail the subsidy. 33,14,488 lakh electricity consumers have applied for power subsidy, while the remaining 13.85 lakh consumers are yet to do it. He said people can give a missed call or send a WhatsApp message on 7011-3111-11 to opt for the subsidy. Out of 47 lakh electricity consumers who avail the subsidy, nearly 30 lakh are those who get zero bills and 16-17 lakh who get a 50 percent subsidy. At present, consumers with a power consumption of less than 200 units do not have to pay any charges and those with a consumption of up to 400 units get a 50 percent subsidy.\n\nNational: Non-Fossil Fuels/ Climate Change Trends\n\nIndia to press rich countries to keep climate fund pledge\n\n31 October: India will use the UN (United Nations) climate conference to urge rich countries to keep their promise to give US$100 billion a year in funding to help developing nations deal with climate change and switch to cleaner energy. New Delhi will also reiterate its commitment to do its best to help slow global warming at the COP27 event. India is the worlds third largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US (United States) though it is much lower down the rankings of emissions per capita, according to Our World Data. It has been ramping up its share of renewable energy, but coal continues to be Indias main fuel for power generation, as the country strives to provide energy for its 1.4 billion people using cheaper fuel. India had already initiated steps such as meeting half of its energy demand from non-fossil fuels and building 500 gigawatts (GW) of non-fossil energy capacity by 2030.\n\nState government must fast-track approvals for Pvt solar plants: CII\n\n28 October: The state government must fast-track the PM Kusum scheme and sign power purchase agreements with landowners who are keen to set up solar plants on uncultivable land, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said. CII said many local companies are ready to set up large solar plants on waste mines. CII Goa has recommended that instead of incurring high capital expenditure to set up solar power plants atop government buildings, the Goa government should ink long-term power purchase agreements with renewable energy service companies. CII asked the government to consider offering incentives to industries that install large scale rooftop solar plants. CII Goa is confident that if the government offers rates in the vicinity of INR4.5 per unit there would be sufficient interested parties that would meet Goas future renewable energy purchase obligation targets\n\nTata Power Solar Systems launches off-grid solar solutions in West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand\n\n26 October: Tata Power Solar Systems announced the launch of cost-efficient solar off-grid solutions in West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. Tata Power Solar Systems Limited (TPSSL) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd (TPREL). The off-grid solutions provide a combination of high-efficient solar modules, inverters and batteries and are available in 11 variants ranging from 1 10 Kw with a 5-year warranty, the company said. These solar off-grid solutions are charged during the daytime and enable consumers to access sustainable electricity by reducing their reliance on costly and polluting alternatives like diesel generators during nighttime and outages.\n\nInternational: Oil\n\nChinas Addax exits from four Nigerian oil blocks: NNPC\n\n1 November: Nigerias NNPC Ltd said Sinopecs Addax Petroleum Development (Nigeria) Ltd had exited from its four major oil mining blocks in Nigeria and transferred them to the state-owned oil company. Addax began operations in Nigeria in 1998 by signing Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) with NNPC. The oil leases were in April 2021 revoked by the petroleum regulator which accused Addax of failing to develop them sufficiently, but the decision was overturned by President Muhammadu Buhari. NNPC became a commercial entity in July and is bulking up assets ahead of a planned initial public offering in the second half of next year.\n\nOil output 1.2 mn bpd, expects no disruption: Libya NOC chief\n\n1 November: Libyas National Oil Corporation (NOC) chief Farhat Bengdara said that oil output had risen to 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from 600,000 bpd three months ago and that NOC does not expect any disruption in oil production. Oil production has been repeatedly hit in Libya an OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member by groups blockading facilities, sometimes to demand material benefits but also as a tactic to achieve wider political ends. Bengdara said that Libya, which is seeking investment to develop new supplies of oil and natural gas, is close to finalising a deal with Italys Eni worth up to US$8 billion.\n\nPemexs crude oil exports rise 30 percent in September, and production was stable\n\n31 October: Mexican state oil firm Pemex recorded a 30 percent monthly jump in crude exports in September from the prior month, boosted by soaring demand from Europe and Asia following Russias invasion of Ukraine. Pemex said in a weekend report it had exported 1.21 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil compared with 914,665 bpd in August. Exports were up 23 percent year-on-year, from the 983,000 bpd recorded last September. The Mexican government, which had said that this year it would move toward refining more oil at home, took advantage of the higher prices that followed Russias war in Ukraine. Pemex said shipments of crude destined for Europe which is looking to wean itself off Russian oil surged 85 percent in September from August to reach 149,734 bpd, while shipments to Asia were up 80 percent at 292,008 bpd.\n\nOPEC expected to stick to the view of long-term oil demand rise\n\n28 October: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is likely to maintain its view world oil demand will rise for another decade, longer than many other forecasters predict, in a forthcoming major report, despite the growing role of renewables and electric cars. OPEC is scheduled to update its long-term oil demand forecasts in its 2022 World Oil Outlook on 31 October. The 2021 version sees oil demand reaching a plateau after 2035. Another decade or more of oil demand growth would be a boost for producers and OPEC, whose 13 members depend on oil income, and would justify continued investment in new supplies. Consumers and governments urging efforts to curb oil use to combat climate change would be less happy.\n\nColombia looking at possible changes to the oil exploration ban\n\n27 October: Colombias government may change its position on prohibiting new contracts for oil exploration, director of public credit Jose Roberto Acosta said. Granting new contracts for oil exploration would represent a major U-turn for the government of leftist President Gustavo Petro, who previously described oil and coal as the countrys top exports as poisons, while also pledging to move Colombia away from hydrocarbons. Petros decision to prevent new oil exploration contracts alongside other comments on capital controls and criticism of the central banks raising the interest rate has caused Colombias peso to depreciate sharply, falling to a record low. Petros government has agreed to modify a tax reform proposal to implement new duties on oil and coal more gradually.\n\nExxon strikes oil again in Guyana with two new discoveries\n\n26 October: Exxon Mobil Corporation has made two new discoveries at the Sailfin-1 and Yarrow-1 wells in the Stabroek block offshore Guyana, the oil major said, potentially adding more barrels to one of the most closely watched new oil discoveries. Exxon did not disclose how much crude oil or gas it estimates the new discoveries to contain. Guyana amounts for one third of the crude discovered in the world since Exxon first hit oil in the country in 2015, according to Rystad consultancy firm. The about 11 billion barrels of recoverable oil discovered prior to Wednesdays finds, should make the country a global oil power in the coming years, Rystad said. Exxon and its partner Hess Corporation said that the Liza Phase 1 and Phase 2, the first projects sanctioned offshore Guyana by the two companies, are producing above capacity and achieved an average of nearly 360,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in the third quarter. The companies expect total production from Guyana to cross a million barrels per day by the end of this decade.\n\nInternational: Gas\n\nTurkish gas hub can easily be set up, reveals pipeline damage details: Russian President\n\n31 October: Russian President Vladimir Putin said a natural gas hub could be set up in Turkey fairly quickly and predicted many customers in Europe would want to sign contracts. Putin proposed Turkey as a base for gas supplies after the Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea were damaged in September by blasts. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan says he agrees with the idea. Putin said it was very difficult to work directly with European commercial partners. The European Union, which previously turned to Russia for about 40 percent of its gas needs, is seeking to wean itself off Russian energy. Putin said Russias Gazprom had been allowed to inspect the damage done when blasts hit the Nord Stream gas pipelines.\n\nQatarEnergy in talks for 30 percent in Lebanon offshore gas project\n\n30 October: QatarEnergy is in talks with the Lebanese government to take a 30 percent stake in an offshore exploration block and is also negotiating with TotalEnergies and Eni on this matter, CEO Saad al-Kaabi confirmed. TotalEnergies and the Lebanese government reached a deal handing the French oil major temporary majority control of the block and paving the way for negotiations with Qatar over a stake in the gas project. The initial exploration licence was held by a three-part consortium of TotalEnergies, Italys Eni, and Russias Novatek. Beirut announced in September that Novatek, which held a 20 percent stake, would exit. Offshore areas in the eastern Mediterranean and Levant have yielded major gas discoveries in the past decade. Interest in these has grown since Russias invasion of Ukraine disrupted gas supplies.\n\nAlgeria signs US$600 mn gas contracts with Italian companies\n\n27 October: Algerias national petrochemicals firm Sonatrach announced it had signed deals worth US$600 million with Italian firms for the extraction and transport of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). In recent months, the EU has been eyeing Algerian gas as a cheaper alternative to overpriced US gas. The Algerian company said it concluded a US$400 million deal with Italian company Tecnimont for the construction of an LPG plant scheduled to be completed in three years. It said that Algerian pipeline company ENAC will build a 65-kilometre (40-mile) conduit to link the plant to an existing transportation network in the countrys east. Sonatrach announced it concluded three other small-scale contracts for LPG-related infrastructure and equipment.\n\nEU Energy Commissioner discusses gas price cap with Norway\n\n27 October: European Union (EU) Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said she had informed Norwegian officials about planned \"emergency measures\" to address high energy prices, including a price cap on natural gas. EU energy ministers discussed proposals to contain and potentially cap gas prices that have soared in the wake of the war in Ukraine and Russian supplies have dwindled. Norway has become the most important natural gas supplier to the EU, accounting for 25 percent of all EU imports, after a drop in Russian gas flows. However, no decision had yet been made and work continued to address questions on how a price cap will secure supply and over its design, she said, speaking after meeting Norways Oil and Energy Minister Terje Aasland.\n\nThe New Italian government aims to double national gas production\n\n27 October: Italy plans to double its national gas production to 6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year from the current 3 bcm, in a further effort to cut the countrys dependence on Russian supplies. The government will authorise new offshore drilling in the Adriatic sea, echoing the words of Italys new Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who said that Rome \"has a duty to fully exploit\" its offshore gas reserves to diversify energy sources.\n\nEnergean starts gas production at Israels Karish site\n\n26 October: Energean has begun production at the Karish offshore gas field and the first gas has been safely delivered, the company said. Israel granted Energean permission to start production at the Karish natural gas field. The London-listed energy group had begun pumping gas to its floating production facility on 9 October as part of reverse flow testing procedures. Energean said gas is being produced from the Karish Main-02 well and the flow of gas is being steadily increased. The Karish Main-01 and Karish Main-03 wells are expected to be opened up in approximately two and four weeks, respectively, it said. Karish has a capacity of 8 billion cubic metres (bcm). The initial capacity is up to 6.5 bcm/year, and commercial gas sales are expected to reach this level within six months. Energean said its growth projects including the Karish North development are on track for completion in late 2023. Then, it said, it would be able to produce the full 8 bcm year capacity.\n\nInternational: Coal\n\nJapans J-Power raises annual profit forecast on higher coal prices\n\n31 October: Japans Electric Power Development Co Ltd (J-Power) raised its net profit forecast by 61 percent to a record 108 billion yen (US$727 million) for the year to 31 March as soaring coal prices boosted gains from its stake in thermal coal mines in Australia. Australias Newcastle thermal coal benchmark futures have more than doubled so far this year following sanctions by Western nations on Russia the worlds third-largest exporter of coal after its invasion of Ukraine. J-Power increased its annual net profit estimate to 108 billion yen, a record since its listing in 2004, from its May forecast of 67 billion yen, thanks to a stronger performance of three Australian coal mines in which it owns a stake. Spot prices for Australian standard thermal coal are now estimated at US$350 a tonne for 2022, up from its May assumption of US$200 a tonne and the actual US$100 a tonne in 2021, it said.\n\nChina coal trade disrupted by COVID outbreaks as winter looms\n\n28 October: Chinas strict COVID-19 policy is constraining coal supplies and pushing up prices, industry officials and traders say, just weeks before the countrys north switches on mostly coal-fired heating systems for winter and demand jumps. The worlds top coal consumer still relies on the fuel to heat homes across much of the colder north, and Beijing is determined to ensure sufficient supplies this year after shortages led to unprecedented power outages in 2021. But Chinas top three coal production regions have reported hundreds of COVID cases in recent weeks, data from the countrys health commission showed, disrupting coal trade. The provinces introduced strict transport curbs this month, leaving some mines unable to ship coal out and forcing them to slow or halt production. In Zhungeer county, which contributes 27 percent of Inner Mongolias coal production, authorities ordered everyone in the area to stay home since 19 October after a solitary COVID case was reported at a coal mine, the local government showed. Two coal mines in Wuhai city in Inner Mongolia suspended production. Meanwhile, a month-long maintenance shutdown at the Daqin railway, Chinas biggest coal transport line connecting the coal mining hubs with Qinhuangdao port, has also been extended for a week after dozens of railway staff contracted COVID in mid-October, coal traders said. Daqin typically transports about 1.3 million tonnes of coal in a normal day, but daily volumes have plunged to between 200,000 tonnes and 300,000 tonnes, according to traders. At major ports coal inventories have also fallen by 3 percent since late September, China Coal Transportation and Distribution (CCTD) agency data showed. Daily coal use at major coastal power plants has slid from over 2 million tonnes (MT) a month ago to below 1.8 MT, which is sufficient for 17 days of use, CCTD data showed.\n\nInternational: Power\n\nLebanon raises the cost of electricity for the first time since the 1990s\n\n1 November: Lebanons state power company Electricite du Liban (EDL) raised the price it charges for electricity for the first time since the 1990s, EDL said, in a move officials say will pave the way for an eventual increase in power supply. Lebanon has not had round-the-clock power since the 1990s and cash transfers to EDL to cover chronic losses have contributed tens of billions of dollars to the countrys huge public debt. Electricity-sector reform is a key demand of donor nations who have pledged to help Lebanon exit a financial crisis if it undertakes reforms. The Government said that increasing the price of power would allow the state to afford to purchase more fuel to fire power plants, thereby increasing supply from an hour or two per day to up to 10 hours per day.\n\nMoldova electricity supplies hit by a cut in Russian gas\n\n31 October: A 40 percent cut in deliveries of Russian natural gas is hitting Moldovas ability to provide sufficient electricity for its 2.5 million people, the Deputy Prime Minister of the small ex-Soviet state, Andrei Spinu, said. Spinu said Russian gas giant Gazprom had promised to supply only 5.7 million cubic metres of gas per day well short of the 11.5 million needed to ensure enough power.\n\nSlovenia to reduce the illumination of highways to save electricity\n\n27 October: Illumination on Slovenias highways will be reduced onwards in a bid to save energy, the countrys state-owned company DARS has announced. The move will save 2,000 megawatt hours of electricity per year, which is equivalent to the average annual consumption of 600 households. From September, the government imposed a one-year price cap on electricity prices for households and small businesses, to ease the burden of rising energy prices on the population. Next month it plans to introduce a scheme to help medium and large companies overcome the energy crisis.\n\nSingapore seeks to boost regional electricity imports by 2035\n\n27 October: Singapore will import more electricity from the region and is on track to reach its import targets of up to 4 gigawatt (GW) of electricity by 2035, Tan See Leng, the manpower minister and second minister for trade and industry, said. The city-states Energy Market Authority (EMA) has launched requests for proposals for electricity import projects from the region, Tan said. The EMA has since received more than 20 proposals from Australia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia and Thailand, Tan said. About 95 percent of Singapores electricity is generated from natural gas, though the country plans to ramp up sources of renewable energy.\n\nUkraine thanks power workers as drone attacks strain grid\n\n27 October: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly thanked the countrys power workers for maintaining the electricity supply as Russia continues to target energy infrastructure ahead of the winter. Authorities have ordered rolling blackouts in many parts of the country and urged households to limit consumption as electricity infrastructure is targeted by Russian attack drones. In a likely response to the Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, a power plant just outside the city had suffered minor damage in a drone attack. A drone hit a transformer and sparked a fire but did not affect its overall operation and did not interrupt the electricity supply.\n\nInternational: Non-Fossil Fuels/ Climate Change Trends\n\nGoogle signs solar power supply deal with SoftBank-backed SB Energy\n\n1 November: Alphabet Incs Google said it would buy about three-quarters of the renewable power from SB Energy Globals Texas facilities, as it aims to operate data centres on carbon-free energy by 2030. Companies are rapidly shifting toward clean energy and transportation as they look to meet environmental and sustainability goals. The US$430 billion Inflation Reduction Act signed by President Joe Biden signed in August also seeks to incentivise a shift to clean energy, by providing tax credits. Google will use the energy from the SoftBank Group Corp-backed company, which will have a capacity of about 3 GW by early next year, to power data centres in Texas, Alphabet said. SB Energys Orion 1, 2 and 3 and Eiffel solar projects which total nearly 1.2 gigawatt (GW) of capacity are expected to be ready to supply power by mid-2024.\n\nPoland andSouth Korea to cooperate on nuclear power project\n\n31 October: Seoul and Warsaw signed outline agreements to develop nuclear power in Poland, as Poland strives to phase out coal and lower its carbon emissions and South Korea seeks to revive its nuclear industry. Polands ZE PAK and PGE) and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) will assess the viability of building four 1,400 megawatt (MW) nuclear reactors in Patnow, central Poland, using South Korean technology, the South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said. Since the election this year of President Yoon Suk-yeol, who pledged to revive the countrys nuclear power industry, South Korea has stepped up efforts to win nuclear power plant export orders.\n\nSingapore to introduce new emissions rules for fossil-fuel power plants\n\n26 October: Singapores energy regulator will be introducing new emissions standards for new and repowered fossil fuel-fired power generation units in 2023, Low Yen Ling, the minister of state for the ministry of trade and industry, said. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) will consult with the industry in the coming months and will release details on the standards subsequently, the minister said. The new rules are part of the implementation of a law the city-state passed last year that allowed the EMA to set greenhouse gas emissions standards. The measure also follows Singapore announcing plans to reduce its emissions target for 2030 to 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ).\n\nThis is a weekly publication of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF).

                "cc_text": "Prices at the pump have plummeted over the past month but a dramatic move from the U.S. and allies meant to slash Russian oil revenue and cripple its war effort could send gas prices rising again, some energy analysts told ABC News.\n\nOn Monday, the European Union slapped a ban on all seaborne imports of Russian oil. On top of that, a group of Western nations imposed a price cap on Russian oil that will prohibit the country from selling crude to third party countries unless the price falls well below market rates.\n\nThe Western scheme aims to choke off the primary source of funds behind the Russian war in Ukraine but the move risks disrupting the global oil supply and spiking gas prices.\n\nThe newly announced measures contributed to a jump in global oil prices in early trading on Monday but prices retreated later in the day.\n\nWhile the exact effect of the price cap remains unclear, some analysts expect the move to send gas prices higher in the coming months as the global market strains under lost Russian oil supply. However, Russia may circumvent the price cap and continue selling oil at its current rate, mitigating any effect on gas prices, other analysts said.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the price cap on Russian oil and how it will affect U.S. gas prices:\n\nWhat is the price cap on Russian oil?\n\nThe price cap on Russian oil is a policy implemented by G-7 nations on Monday that will disallow the world's second-largest oil exporter from selling crude at a price above $60 per barrel.\n\nSince the outset of its war with Ukraine, Russia has sold its oil at discounted prices. As of Friday, Russian Urals crude traded at $67 per barrel -- an amount little higher than the cap. But the price cap aims to ensure that Russian oil sales remain well below global oil prices, which stand at about $80 per barrel.\n\nThe policy relies on compliance from insurance companies, shipping outfits and other businesses involved in the transport of Russian oil. Many of those firms are based in Western countries and will play a key role in ensuring that any sale of oil from Russia is kept below the mandated price.\n\nAlongside a newly announced EU ban on seaborne imports of Russian oil, the price cap will, in theory, limit the amount of revenue Russia can generate from the sale of oil to countries that have not imposed a ban.\n\nWhat's the reason behind the price cap?\n\nWestern countries have slapped the price cap on Russian oil in pursuit of a balance between two goals: curtailing the oil funds that drive Russia's war effort while allowing the country to continue selling oil in order to preserve global supply and avert a far-reaching price shock.\n\nThe price cap was set at $60 per barrel after months of contentious negotiations between Western allies, some of whom wanted a much lower cap in hope of severely undermining Russia's war aims while others wanted a higher cap that would keep oil flowing and prices low.\n\n\"It's very delicate,\" Ramanan Krishnamoorti, a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Houston, told ABC News. \"The sale of crude is funding the war. They're really trying to take out that economic engine.\"\n\n\"But if you cut the price too low, Russia has no reason to produce. It says, 'I'll shut it down and hurt all of you in ways that will hurt the global economy,\" he added.\n\nLeaders of the G7 group of nations in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, June 27, 2022. Pool/Getty Images\n\nHow will Russia respond to the price cap?\n\nA Russian government official sharply criticized the price cap on Sunday, saying the company would halt oil sales to any country that supports the measure.\n\nMikhail Ulyanov, a senior Russian diplomat, accused Western nations of weaponizing oil markets.\n\n\"They can make politically motivated anti-market decisions putting at risk stability of the oil market,\" he said. \"Russia has the right to react accordingly.\"\n\nRussia will likely seek to undermine and circumvent the price cap by using insurance and shipping companies that operate outside the purview of the ban, David Doherty, an analyst who tracks the oil industry at BloombergNEF, told ABC News.\n\nSuch a response would preserve the current level of Russian oil sales and avert disruption of global supply, leaving oil and gasoline prices largely unchanged, he added.\n\n\"You'll see a status quo where China and India continue to take Russian barrels, using ships that are non-EU and insurance that's non-EU,\" he said.\n\nWhat does the price cap mean for gas prices in the US?\n\nStill, some analysts said the EU ban and price cap would curtail global oil supply and ultimately drive U.S. gasoline prices upward. Even if Russia evades some enforcement of the ban, they will struggle to sustain their current output or intentionally cut exports, they said.\n\n\"There is going to be a shortening of supply and therefore a price increase for crude oil and that will get reflected in an increased price at the gas pump for all of us,\" said Krishnamoorti, of the University of Houston.\n\nThe Western moves will result in an increase in U.S. gasoline prices of between 5% to 10% over the next three weeks, Krishnamoorti estimated.\n\nGlobal oil prices face other headwinds like an OPEC Plus decision to preserve output at current levels that could further strain supply as well as the potential lifting of COVID lockdowns in China that may boost demand.\n\nTaken together, these factors could send U.S. gasoline prices up as much as 25% over the next three weeks, Krishnamoorti warned.\n\nHowever, other analysts said that the impact of the cap on Russian oil prices could be minimal or nonexistent, cautioning that it remains too early to tell how U.S. gas prices will respond.\n\n\"Consumers don't necessarily need to be worried about an imminent shockwave,\" Patrick de Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told ABC News. \"There are thousands of potential outcomes.\"",

The attacks reportedly resulted in casualties and damage to at least one of the bombers, highlighting a significant blow to the Kremlin's assumptions of security for its military assets in the country's interior (3,4).",
                "summary": "Ukrainian forces carried out unprecedented strikes on Engels-2 and Dyagilevo Air Force Bases using a Soviet-era unmanned aerial vehicle, impacting the strategic bomber capabilities of Russia by demonstrating the vulnerability of its interior military installations (1). The attacks marked a significant blow to the Kremlin, as they challenged the assumption that Russia could protect its deep interior and maintain safe harbors for its strategic bombers, which have been used to launch attacks on Ukraine (2). Although Russian defenses claimed to have intercepted the drones, there was still loss of life and some damage to the aircraft, including a Backfire bomber, indicating that the strikes had a tangible impact on Russian military assets (3). The incidents have raised questions about the effectiveness of Russian air defenses and represent a potential major escalation in the conflict (5).",
                "more_detailed": "On December 5, Ukrainian forces allegedly conducted drone strikes on two Russian airbases, Engels-2 and Dyagilevo, using modified Soviet-era Tu-141 unmanned aerial vehicles. These attacks, which are reported to have occurred hundreds of kilometers inside Russian territory, represent a significant escalation, as they targeted facilities far from the front lines and close to Moscow (1,2,3,4,5,9). The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that the drone attacks resulted in the deaths of at least three Russian servicemen and caused damage to two Tu-95 strategic bombers, though they claimed the drones were shot down and the damage to the aircraft was superficial (3,4,9,10). This marks the first time Ukraine has directly hit Russian bombers that have been attacking Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and energy grid (6).\n\nThe implications of these strikes for Russia's strategic bomber capabilities are twofold. Firstly, the attacks have raised serious questions about the effectiveness of Russian air defenses, particularly as they occurred at bases that are considered to be well within the interior of the country and previously thought to be beyond the reach of Ukrainian capabilities (5,7). Secondly, while the material damage to the strategic bombers might be ambiguous, the attacks have undoubtedly had a psychological impact, undermining Russian confidence in their air defense and providing a morale boost for Ukrainian forces and civilians (7,8). Additionally, the attacks signal a potential shift in Ukrainian strategy, demonstrating an ability to strike at key military assets deep within Russian territory, which could force Russia to reassess the security of their strategic assets (2,8)."

Moreover, the strikes have political implications, reinforcing President Putin's narrative that Russia is engaged in a patriotic struggle for survival, and thereby justifying extreme measures, including the potential use of Russia's vast nuclear arsenal as a deterrent or retaliation (1,3). This has implications for Russia's relations with neighboring countries, particularly Ukraine, as it demonstrates Kyiv's capability and willingness to escalate the conflict on its own terms, which could influence diplomatic and military decisions in the ongoing conflict (2,6).\n\nFurthermore, the attacks have broader implications for international law and human rights. The targeting of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine by Russian forces, which has rendered some cities barely habitable, constitutes a violation of International humanitarian law and is considered a war crime, exacerbating tensions and potentially impacting Russia's international relations (7). Western reactions to these developments, such as cautious comments from leaders like France's Macron, could affect the unity of Western allies against Russia, as they grapple with the implications of providing security guarantees to Moscow amidst these escalations (8). Simultaneously, Ukraine's refusal to concede any land and the continuous targeting of its energy infrastructure underline the heightened stakes and the potential for further deterioration in Russia's relations with its neighbors (9). The regional security dynamics are further complicated by Russia's concerns regarding U.S. military capabilities and Putin's claims of Russia's advanced hypersonic weapons, which could also influence Russia's strategic calculations and its interactions with neighboring countries (10)."

The air bases' locations, hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border, demonstrate their strategic importance in projecting Russian military power and the ability to operate at great distances from the front lines, which has been highlighted by recent Ukrainian drone strikes (4,8).\n\nUkrainian strikes on these bases not only reveal vulnerabilities in Russian reconnaissance and air defense but also have significant military and political ramifications. Militarily, they challenge Russia's perceived security of strategic assets deep within its territory and politically, they serve to bolster Ukrainian morale while exposing Russian defense weaknesses (3,7). The attacks on Engels and Dyagilevo, which have been described as long-range and unprecedented, underscore the evolving dynamics of the conflict, as Ukraine demonstrates its capability to escalate actions and strike high-value targets within Russia, thereby shifting the narrative of the war and affecting Russian confidence (5,9)."

The strikes on airfields hundreds of miles inside Russia, not directly claimed by Ukraine but hinted at by Ukrainian officials, have shown that Ukraine can escalate the conflict on its terms, possibly altering the Kremlin's military and political calculations (2,7,10).\n\nThis shift in strategy also poses a serious challenge for Russia, both militarily and politically, as it showcases Ukraine's ability to target strategic sites and disrupt Russian military operations (5). The attacks, such as those on the Engels and Ryazan air bases, which house aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons, have immediate battlefield implications and could change Western perceptions of Russian threats (5,7). The lack of Ukrainian official acknowledgment does not diminish the significance of these strikes, which could be part of a larger Ukrainian strategy to extend the war's scope and compel a reassessment of Russia's military objectives and capabilities (3,8,9,10)."

While Ukraine has not officially acknowledged the use of long-range attack drones, the country has been successful in producing several of its own long-range weapon systems, in addition to receiving aid such as Bayraktar TB2 strike drones and Switchblade 300 loitering munitions (4). The Ukrainian government's cryptic messaging and lack of official comment suggest a strategic stance on the utilization and acknowledgment of these capabilities (3). It can be inferred that Ukrainian UAV tactics involve leveraging existing technology, possibly Soviet-era equipment, while also developing and integrating modern systems to enhance their strike options and maintain operational ambiguity (3,4,6)."

Engels is a port city on the Volga River located in Saratov Oblast, in western Russia, around 500 miles (more than 800 kilometers) southeast of Moscow. The CCTV footage shared on social media was recorded approximately 3.7 miles (nearly 6 kilometers) away from where the Engels-2 airfield is located, a strategic bomber airbase. Saratov region Gov. Roman Busargin, reassured residents on Telegram that no civilian infrastructure was damaged but said \"information about incidents at military facilities is being checked by law enforcement agencies.\" He acknowledged information about \"about a loud bang and a burst in Engels in the early morning\" was spreading on social networks and the media. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked about this incident and another explosion at a Russian airfield near the city of Ryazan, around 200 kilometers (about 124 miles) southeast of Moscow, during a regular call with journalists on Monday. CNN had contacted the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment. Later Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry said that Ukraine used drones toattack two Russian military airfields on Monday morning. In a statement carried on the official Russian news agency RIA Novosti, the ministry said the attacks were \"in the Saratov and Ryazan regions\" but had been intercepted byair defenses. Russian state media also reported three people were killed and six injured after a fuel truck exploded at the Russian airfield near the city of Ryazan. The explosion occurred at an aircraft parking lot at the airfield, emergency services told state news agency TASS on Monday. Pro-Russian bloggers have said that the incidents were likely an act of sabotage from Ukraine. Yurii Ihnat, spokesperson for the Command of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, shared a social media report of a \"blast at the Engels airfield\" on Facebook but made no claim of responsibility. \"And who did it?,\" he wrote. Later on national television Ihnat referenced the blasts while announcing the launch of a new Russian missile attack towards Ukraine, saying: \"We have information that today there were blasts at the Engels airfield. And immediately after that there was a commotion at this airfield. \"Perhaps it is not connected with this, but still we see that strategic bombers have taken off and the first wave of missiles was already launched. There may be several of them [waves], they may use several waves of attacks to disperse the missiles throughout Ukraine and to confuse the actions of our air defense.\"",

An etiquette expert shares her social \"dos\" and \"donts\" this holiday season.\n\nUC strike\n\nA work stoppage by University of California graduate workers, postdoctoral students and researchers has slowed work across the 10 UC campuses. Many are calling it the largest strike in the history of higher education in America. Although a tentative agreement was reached between the UC and its postdoctoral scholars and academic researchers, those employees wont resume their work in solidarity with the academic student employees and student researchers who still dont have a contract. The strike's outcome could have major impacts on higher education in California and the workforce it relies upon. CapRadio Reporter Janelle Salanga joined Insight to share their reporting and provide the latest on this nearly month-long strike.\n\nCal Poly SLO diversity investigation\n\nAccording to California State University, the higher education system educates the most racially, ethnically, economically, and academically diverse student body in the nation. However, an investigative series found the data without context can be misleading and overshadow room for improvement, particularly with Black and African American students. Mikhail Zinshteyn covers higher education for CalMatters and Insight spoke with to discuss his ongoing series titled, \"Lagging behind: Cal State's education of Black students.\" We focused specifically on Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, which Mikhail found is the only public university in the state where more than half of undergraduate students are white. He also found Cal Poly has the lowest enrollment of Black undergraduates out of any Cal State or UC campus, enrolling just 146 Black students out of a student body of more than 20,000, that's less than one percent. Mikhail shared how this gap ultimately shapes campus culture and the college experience.\n\nHoliday etiquette\n\nFor better or for worse, December can be packed with socializing. Holiday parties of all types and sizes can fill the month, which means the opportunity for fun, but also perhaps some uncomfortable moments. Rosalinda Oropeza Randall is an etiquette and civility expert. She joined Insight to help us navigate holiday gatherings with ease, which can be easier said than done.",

The latest developments on the women-led protests in Iran. An update on Sacramentos African American Experience Project.\n\nCalifornia's hate crime commission\n\nWe have seen videos from the streets of San Francisco where an older Asian woman or man is beaten and attacked for no reason. Mass shootings targeting a certain group, race, and ethnicity. In our area, antisemitic symbols are left on both Sac State and UC Davis campuses or hung on freeway overpasses for all to see. If you think you've been hearing more about hate crimes over the past couple of years, especially since the start of the pandemic, you'd be right. According to a recently published report, the California Attorney General's office says hate crimes are at their highest reported level in 20 years, up 32% when just comparing 2020 to 2021. That includes crimes against Hispanics, the LGBTQ+ community, and African-Americans. But the highest rise in hate crimes targeted Asian Americans, up 177%. Now, California is making it easier for citizens to report these types of crimes. CapRadio's Race and Equity Reporter Sarah Mizes-Tan joined Insight to share more details on the new Commission on the State of Hate and the resources available for reporting cases. You can also report cases by phone at 1-833-8NO-HATE.\n\nIran protests\n\nNearly three months ago, the death of a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman in the custody of Iran's morality police ignited massive protests across the Islamic Republic. Since Mahsa Amini's death, the protests, led by women and the country's youth, have plunged the country into political turmoil. The Iranian government confirms at least 300 Iranians have been killed in the nationwide protests so far, but human rights groups believe the number is far higher. And the United Nations believes at least 14,000 have been detained, including children. The government took an even more drastic step to quell the protests, its parliament voting to approve the death penalty for those found guilty of participating in the unrest. The turmoil also spilled onto the global stage at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Although the country has seen several large protests since the Iranian Revolution more than four decades ago, the death of Mahsa Amini has called into question the strength and legitimacy of Iran's clerical rule. Dr. Sahar Razavi, Director of the Iranian and Middle East Studies Center at Sacramento State, first joined Insight almost two weeks after Amini's death to help provide more context behind the protests. She rejoined us to discuss the latest developments in the protests and how the Iranian community in California is reacting.\n\nAfrican American Experience Project\n\nThis year the city of Sacramento launched an ambitious historical review of African American history to highlight the significant contributions of Black Sacramentans from the citys earliest years through the 20th century. Before the African American Experience Project began, the city lacked a historical framework to preserve the physical embodiments or intangible memories of Sacramentos black experience for future generations. Recently, the project achieved a big milestone in this effort, releasing its first public draft of its Historic Context Statement. The nearly 150-page document is an initial outline that will eventually help the city preserve buildings and other landmarks of Black cultural and historical significance in Sacramento. Carson Anderson, Co-Director of the project, Joined Insight to tell us more about this document and provide an update on the project.",

In an interview with the Economist, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhny, said he was trying to prepare for Russian forces to have another go at taking the city, possibly in February or March. In response to a question where he was asked what he makes of Russias mobilisation of 300,000 reservists and former soldiers, he said it had worked. \"They may not be that well equipped, but they still present a problem for us. We estimate that they have a reserve of 1.2 million to 1.5 million people The Russians are preparing some 200,000 fresh troops. I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv.\" Zaluzhny said that generals had worked out how many tanks, artillery and soldiers they need to repel another concerted effort by Russian troops. He said that Russian commanders had pulled soldiers back beyond the range of the US-made HIMARS multiple rocket launcher systems, and that Ukraine hasnt got anything longer range. The 49-year-old made a comparison to the second world war, and said \"somewhere beyond the Urals, they are preparing new resources\". \"According to my calculations it must have been three and a half or four years that they built [resources] up intensively: people, equipment, ammunition. I think they had three months worth of resources to achieve their goals. The fact that they have exhausted these resources and wasted their potential without achieving practically any result, shows that their position was chosen incorrectly. They now have to think again about how to get out of this situation. \"So most likely they are looking for ways to stop [fighting] and get a pause by any means: shelling civilians, leaving our wives and children to freeze to death. They need it for one simple purpose: they need time to gather resources and create new potential so they can continue to fulfil their goals. \"In my personal opinion, I am not an energy expert but it seems to me we are on the edge. We are balancing on a fine line. And if [the power grid] is destroyed that is when soldiers wives and children start freezing. And such a scenario is possible. What kind of mood the fighters will be in, can you imagine? Without water, light and heat, can we talk about preparing reserves to keep fighting?\"\n\nUpdated at 08.18 EST\n\n15 Dec 2022 13.45 EST Closing summary Its approaching 9pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, as the war continues on the 295th day.

Poland had objected to a minimum corporate tax level, which diplomats had told Reuters had \"blindsided\" those negotiating the deals. The deal has needed unanimity, but border countries Poland and Lithuania have said they were concerned that proposed exceptions for food security might benefit Russian oligarchs in the fertiliser business.

Vladimir Potanin has had restrictions placed on him because of his involvement in Interros, a conglomerate that works across several sectors including manufacturing, construction and finance. He had already been placed under sanctions by the UK government, in June. The 61-year-old served in office for seven months in the mid-1990s under Boris Yeltsin. Potanin is Russias second-richest man. He has been placed under sanctions along with his wife, Ekaterina, and two adult children, Ivan and Anastasia. His superyacht Nirvana has also been designated as \"blocked property\". US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: \"The United States continues to impose costs on Russia for its war of aggression against Ukraine. Russias attacks have devastated Ukraines critical infrastructure and caused extraordinary death and destruction. Today, we are announcing additional sanctions measures on the Russian federation and its enablers. \"Our actions today are a clear message that the United States will not hesitate to continue to use the tools at our disposal to promote an end to, and accountability for, president Putins unconscionable war.\"\n\nUpdated at 11.16 EST\n\n15 Dec 2022 10.55 EST Ukraines deputy defence minister has said Russia is using propaganda to try to bring Volodymyr Zelenskiys government to the negotiating table. Hanna Mailar told a briefing at the Military Media Centre that messaging was focused on the \"inevitability\" of the energy crisis in Ukraine, accusations of the authorities ignoring domestic problems, and highlighting Russias military strength. \"With each missile attack, Russia hopes to change the course of the war in its favour.\" she said. \"With each missile strike, the Kremlin hopes to plunge us into total darkness. With each missile strike, the terrorist state hopes to break the Ukrainians, turning our nation into the same slaves of the system as the Russians. However, these attempts turn out to be useless, time and again.\"\n\nUpdated at 11.12 EST\n\n15 Dec 2022 10.39 EST A German arms manufacturer will open a new factory in Germany to produce parts for its Gepard anti-aircraft guns, after Switzerland banned Germany from sending any munitions made in Switzerland to Ukraine. Rheinmetall said it would open a \"new production line in Germany for medium-calibre ammunition\" which will include \"the possibility of producing 35mm ammunition for the Gepard air defence system\", according to a statement sent to Agence France-Presse. The facility will be completed in January 2023, and it will begin producing munitions from June. Its location has not been announced. Germany has sent some arms to Ukraine to help it deal with Russias invasion. However its own production of munitions is limited, and earlier this year it asked Switzerland for permission to send Ukraine 12,400 pieces of Swiss-made ammunition. Berne said no, saying it would compromise its neutrality. Rheinmetall did not directly reference the Swiss veto but said a central aim of the new production line was to \"make the ammunition supply in Germany independent of foreign production sites again\".\n\nUpdated at 11.13 EST\n\n15 Dec 2022 10.10 EST A Polish police chief has been taken to hospital for treatment after a gift from a senior Ukrainian official exploded. Jarosaw Szymczyk received minor injuries after a gift exploded in a room next to his office on Wednesday. He had recently met the head of Ukraines police and emergency services during his visit, and received the gift during it. He is still in hospital under observation. A civil servant in the national police headquarters also suffered minor injuries, but did not need hospital treatment. \"The Polish side has asked the Ukrainian side to provide an explanation,\" the interior ministry said.\n\nUpdated at 11.13 EST\n\n15 Dec 2022 09.50 EST Russian forces attacked critical infrastructure in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Thursday, causing several explosions, the citys mayor said. \"Explosions in Kharkiv. The enemy is targeting infrastructure facilities. I am asking everyone to exercise utmost caution and stay in shelters if possible,\" Mayor Ihor Terekhov wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nUpdated at 11.13 EST\n\n15 Dec 2022 09.25 EST A gift that a Polish police commander received during a recent visit to Ukraine exploded at police headquarters in Warsaw, causing the commander and a civilian employee to suffer minor injuries, the Polish interior ministry has said. The explosion occurred on Wednesday morning at 7.50am, the ministry said. It did not specify what object the Polish commander received as a present during the working visit to Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. The commander met with leaders of the Ukrainian Police and Emergency Situations Service on Sunday and Monday, the ministry said. After the explosion, \"the Polish side has asked the Ukrainian side to provide relevant explanations\", it said. It added that the police commander has been in a hospital since Wednesday for observation, while the civilian employee did not require hospitalisation.\n\nUpdated at 09.30 EST\n\n15 Dec 2022 08.53 EST Zelenskiy says next six months will be 'decisive' in war Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that the next six months of the conflict with Russia will be \"decisive\" in the war. In an online address to the European Council on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: \"The next six months will be decisive in many respects in the confrontation that Russia started with their aggression. \"Aggression against Ukraine and against each of you, because Russias final target is much farther than our border and Ukrainian sovereignty. The next six months will demand from us even greater efforts than were undertaken over the past period.\" He said that Russias attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure must be stopped and called for more weapons. \"We need more modern weapons, a larger volume of supplies,\" he said, in comments reported by the Ukrainian Ukrinform news website. As the war goes into its 10th month, he referred to the liberation of Kherson in November. \"This liberation showed the world that our common defence is not something accidental, but our inalienable strength that cant be stopped.\"\n\nUpdated at 09.02 EST\n\n15 Dec 2022 08.40 EST The UN diplomat in charge of aid said it was unlikely the Black Sea grain deal would be expanded to include more ports or reduce inspection times. Kyiv has called for an expansion of the deal with Moscow, which allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of three Ukrainian ports. More than 14m tonnes of grain have been exported since the deal was agreed, the UN said on Thursday. However Martin Griffiths told Reuters that he did not think it would happen. \"I think it would be great if it could be expanded. The more grain that gets out into the world, the better clearly from our point of view, from the worlds point of view. But I dont think thats immediately likely,\" he said. Griffiths has been in Ukraine this week as he visited the cities of Mykolaiv and Kherson to inspect aid delivery. He added that talks continue for Russia to resume its ammonia exports through the Black Sea.\n\nUpdated at 09.04 EST\n\n15 Dec 2022 08.07 EST Putin seeking ties with Asia, Africa and Latin America to overcome financial impact of sanctions Vladimir Putin has said that Russia will try to overcome the financial impact of sanctions by selling gas to its eastern neighbours. In a televised speech he said Russia would develop its economic ties with countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America after the west introduced sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine. In the televised meeting with officials on Thursday, he was told that Russias GDP was expected to fall by 2.5% in 2022. \"We will remove restrictions in logistics and finance. Let me remind you that by introducing sanctions, western countries were trying to push Russia to the periphery of world development. But we will never take the route of self-isolation,\" he said, in quotes published by the Reuters news agency. \"On the contrary, we are broadening, and will broaden, cooperation with all who have an interest in that.\"\n\nUpdated at 09.05 EST",

Exiled monarchists, unrepentant leftists, enraged academics, popular celebrities, and disillusioned reformists are clamoring for the Islamic Republics revolutionary overthrow, while a young generation of angry dissidents defiantly protests all over the country. The specter of the popular revolution that toppled the monarchy forty-three years ago is back with a vengeance, capturing Irans collective imagination. Revolutionary fervor is particularly strong in cyberspace and diaspora opposition circles and gatherings, where anything less than calling for total regime change is deemed treasonous. Particularly in the diaspora, even Iranian reactionaries have become revolutionary, unknowingly going back to the original meaning of \"revolution\" as the restoration of an overturned status quo. Oddly, those who dream of restoring the \"golden age\" of monarchy are in a bind since their presumed standard-bearer, the son of the last Shah, has declared no interest in wearing the crown. Their nostalgic message, however, powerfully echoes in Iran via a barrage of satellite television programs mainly funded by the US government and Saudi Arabia. Some diaspora factions favor Donald Trumpstyle draconian sanctions on Iran, even if they badly hurt ordinary Iranians and strengthen the Islamic Republic, which blames its failures on foreign pressure. Some go as far as advocating US or Israeli military intervention to topple the Islamic Republic and \"free\" Iran, conveniently forgetting the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan. From its inception almost half a century ago, the 197879 Iranian Revolution has spun enduring mythologies that powerfully impinge upon our understanding of contemporary political reality. In this essay, we will examine some of these revolutionary myths, not dismissively, but in the hope of soberly looking beyond them.\n\nMyths of 1979 Ironically, all those calling for another revolution agree that Irans last revolutionary upheaval, in 197879, installed a more repressive regime than the one it toppled. The powerful myth of a liberating revolution, however, does not arise from mere fantasy, since Irans modern history has been exceptionally revolutionary. Iranians have experienced two revolutions across the twentieth century (190610 and 197879) as well as near-revolutionary crises between them, while three popular uprisings have occurred in the current century (19992000, 200910, and 2017present). Moreover, the myth of an apocalyptic rising, cleansing the world of evil, is embedded in the messianic expectations of Shii Islam, for centuries the religion of most Iranians. Yet religious analogies should not be pushed too far. Contrary to common perceptions, Irans 197879 \"Islamic Revolution\" was about a politically instrumentalist use of religion, rather than the fanatical upsurge of religiosity. Iranians have experienced two revolutions across the twentieth century while three popular uprisings have occurred in the current century. Installed on his throne by a 1953 British-American coup, the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, systematically suppressed pent-up secular nationalist and left-wing political aspirations for twenty-five years. When a prerevolutionary crisis emerged in 197778, the Shah refused to compromise with liberal constitutionalist dissidents until the oppositions leadership passed to Ayatollah Khomeini, an exiled cleric who resolutely insisted on the monarchys overthrow. The United States was the Shahs foreign benefactor, exploiting his megalomania to recycle Irans oil wealth in exchange for expensive American armaments and nuclear power plants. On the eve of the revolution, thirty thousand American military advisors, technicians, entrepreneurs, and their families lived in Iran, most of them involved with the Shahs madcap projects and thus familiarizing Iranians firsthand with the \"Ugly American\" image. Inevitably, the 197879 revolution delivered a powerful anti-imperialist message, something Ayatollah Khomeini borrowed from the Marxist left to make the centerpiece of his \"Islamic\" revolutionary agenda. Islamic anti-imperialism, however, followed the script of Shii passion plays, simplistically blaming all of Irans problems on a \"puppet\" king serving the American \"Great Satan.\" This script steered the revolution away from tackling domestic targets, such as class, gender, and ethnic oppression, while also obscuring the fact that the Great Satans contradictory policies had undermined the Shah and smoothed the transfer of power to Khomeini.\n\nThe Islamic Republic Triumphantly returning from exile in the winter of 1979, the ayatollah hastily held a referendum, asking Iranians to endorse an undefined \"Islamic Republic.\" The resounding positive answer gave Khomeinis followers a blank check to write an \"Islamic\" blueprint for future government. At that point, the anti-monarchist revolutionary coalition, joining Khomeinis followers to secular nationalists and various leftist factions, began to fall apart. In an important sense, the revolution was only beginning after the Shahs departure, unfolding into radical uncharted territory without a clear direction or agenda. This is when the revolution was \"hijacked\" by a certain faction in Khomeinis camp, just as the Russian Revolution was \"hijacked\" by the Bolsheviks in 1917 and the French Revolution by the Jacobins in 1793. The making of an Islamic Republic, however, would take a few years of bloody repression, a major confrontation with the United States, and a full-scale war with Iraq. The first major postrevolutionary fissure in Tehran occurred in March 1979, when thousands of women angrily defied Khomeinis mandating of the hijab. The ayatollah backed down and compulsory hijab had to wait until the new regime could consolidate its repressive organs. The revolution was only beginning after the Shahs departure, unfolding into radical uncharted territory without a clear direction or agenda. Back in 1979s \"Spring of Freedom,\" Iran was a blissfully stateless country. The Shahs army and police had collapsed. Ethnic minorities, most notably in Kurdistan, were effectively autonomous. Workers had taken over the factories, while peasants and poor people were seizing land, and leftist students dominated university campuses. Government employees were in charge of their workplaces, and popular \"committees\" ran day-to-day affairs in every neighborhood. Only the coercive power of a new state could contain the revolutions drift toward battering social hierarchies. This was a task that the Islamic Republic took upon itself. Thus, Khomeinis hardcore followers reneged on the promise of a democratic constitution, proposing instead the investiture of dictatorial powers in the office of a Supreme Leader, ruling via unelected clerical bodies superimposed on a parliamentary republican frame. By the summer of 1979, the battle lines were drawn over the proposed dictatorial constitution, with Khomeinis camp being challenged most vehemently by small but influential leftist factions. A multi-pronged left was gaining more traction primarily in autonomy-seeking regions, particularly Kurdistan, and in universities and factories across the country. Khomeinis followers were capable of pushing through the new constitution, but their side was losing momentum. Their state-building project had to contain and outflank a defiant left, accusing them of compromise with the old social order and American imperialism. With Khomeinis blessing, Tehrans provisional government had cordial relations with Washington, even receiving CIA reports on Kurdistan, Soviet moves in Afghanistan, and Iraqi plans for an invasion of Iran. All of this changed with a political coup that consolidated Khomeinis state-making project, at the cost of irreparably damaging US-Iranian relations.\n\nThe Anti-Imperialism of Fools In late October 1979, a sick and dying Shah flew from his Mexican exile to a New York hospital for a last-ditch cancer operation. Against their own better judgment, Jimmy Carter and his advisors let the pro-Shah lobby convince them to bring the Shah to the United States. This blunder had no justification since the Shah was receiving adequate medical treatment in Mexico. Soon a diplomatic firestorm broke out, as the Islamic Republic claimed that admitting the Shah involved a US conspiracy to restore the monarchy. Iranian authorities knew the Shah was dying and that the Carter administration had no plans for regime change in Iran. Still, angry crowds gathered in threatening protests in front of the US embassy in Tehran, which militant leftists had briefly occupied after the Shahs fall. A repeat of such leftist initiatives was preempted when hundreds of university students occupied the embassy on November 4, organized by a cleric with ties to Khomeinis son. The ayatollah quickly endorsed the occupation, realizing the political windfall such an \"anti-imperialist\" posture, which he called \"the Second Revolution,\" could bring to his state-building agenda. The prolonged standoff with the United States, the so-called American hostage crisis, confused the already divided left. The pro-Soviet communist party hailed it as proof of Khomeinis anti-imperialism, while a leftist minority saw it as a ploy to harness the revolutions anti-imperialist momentum toward building a clerical dictatorship. As a cogent outside observer, Fred Halliday, put it, this was an \"anti-imperialism of fools,\" whose harmful consequences for Iran were incalculable. Intuitively following Nazi jurist Carl Schmitts script, the Islamic Republic would fashion itself through an existential confrontation with a foreign \"enemy\" that was said to be behind all domestic discord and dissent. Accordingly, the hostage crisis dragged on until Khomeinis camp could consolidate power and stamp out all opposition. The Shahs death in July 1980 made his extradition a moot point, allowing a possible resolution to the US-Iran standoff. Before this could happen, everything changed again when Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, declared war on Iran in September 1980. Khomeini welcomed the new crisis as another God-given opportunity to prove the revolutions righteous course under his own tutelage, arguing that Saddam Hussein merely waged war on behalf of the United States. The war with Iraq initially gave the Islamic Republic a huge political boost while leading to disastrous long-term consequences. But the facts were rather different. The prolonged standoff with the United States had put the Islamic Republic at odds with both superpowers and the international community. Meanwhile, Khomeini was calling on Iraqs majority Shii population to rise up and overthrow their government. This provided Saddam Hussein with both the incentive and the opportunity to attack a militarily weak and diplomatically isolated Iran, hoping to force a settlement of old disputes and possibly overthrow Khomeini. As with the hostage crisis, the war initially gave the Islamic Republic a huge political boost while leading to disastrous long-term consequences. In a familiar historical pattern, the invasion of a country in the throes of revolution made the people rally around those in power. Millions diverted their revolutionary zeal to the battlefield, and even some of the Shahs retired or imprisoned military personnel volunteered to defend the motherland. The war postponed a hostage release deal until after the US presidential election, which Carter lost largely because of his failure to get the hostages back in time. Khomeini therefore could claim that he had brought down not only the Shah but an American president. This \"victory,\" however, would cost Iran entrenched US enmity and a long war with an enormous human toll and devastating economic damages.\n\nBlood Taxes When a ceasefire finally came eight years later, Iran and Iraq had suffered more than six hundred thousand casualties each, while the wars cost was estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. Saddam Hussein had started the war, but it was Khomeini who dragged it on for six years after Iran took back its lost territory in 1982. Khomeini did not care about the staggering damage inflicted on Iranians or Iraqis, agreeing to a cease-fire only when it became obvious that the wars continuation could bring about his regimes collapse. The Iran-Iraq War had profound political consequences. As Iran went on the offensive, both the United States and the USSR provided significant support to Iraq. By 198788, US-Iranian military skirmishes threatened to break out into full-scale war in the Persian Gulf. Oddly enough, while claiming it was fighting the United States, the Islamic Republic had been clandestinely receiving military aid from both Washington and Tel Aviv. In the mid-1980s, President Ronald Reagan authorized secret contacts, including arms deals, with Tehran, to fund a right-wing paramilitary insurgency in Nicaragua. The exposure of these contacts in the so-called Iran-Contra scandal nearly brought down his administration. Meanwhile, the almost decade-long war had fundamentally shaped the Islamic Republics makeup. In a repeat of another familiar postrevolutionary pattern, state-making and war-making were intertwined, turning the Islamic Republic into a politically and economically authoritarian warfare-welfare state. Iran and Iraq suffered more than six hundred thousand casualties each, while the wars cost was estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. In the early 1980s, the regime had wiped out thousands of religious and secular leftists in a mini civil war that also crushed Kurdish autonomy. The revolutions massive grassroots energy went into a pointless war, requiring poor and working-class Iranians to defer all their demands, endure severe material deprivation, and pay a \"blood tax\" with their lives. A tightly controlled statist economy regimented labor, destroyed independent unions, and regulated capital accumulation. Food rations and wage and price controls became the norm, while veterans and their families received cash stipends and preferential access to public amenities and services. Thus, millions of citizens, mostly from the urban and rural lower classes, were integrated into a vast but rudimentary welfare state, geared toward seemingly permanent war-making. In the years following the war, these infrastructural transformations brought tangible benefits to the poorest strata, perhaps buying their quiescence for some time. During the 1980s, the states access to considerable oil income made its social engineering projects possible, but the wars ending had left the country in ruins. The ailing Khomeini died soon after the cease-fire though not before ordering a massacre of thousands of political prisoners. He had bequeathed unlimited authority to his successors, explicitly empowering them to go as far as suspending the basic tenets of Islam for \"reasons of state.\" Khomeinis final testament was a clear admission that in the Islamic Republic, religion was a handmaiden of politics a point that became obvious in the course of his succession. The regimes inner circle closed rank and chose Ali Khamenei, a political cleric who was not even an ayatollah, to succeed Khomeini as Supreme Leader. Khamenei still wields unlimited power in that office.\n\nReformist Hopes The 1990s became a decade of postwar economic reconstruction, moving away from a statist regime and gradually conforming to the neoliberal world order. Freed from the wars wastefulness, a considerable amount of oil income went into building an infrastructure of roads, dams, and electrification, as well as significantly expanding public health and education. While the preferential treatment of regime loyalists continued, the population at large, particularly in rural areas, benefitted from the economic policies that brought major relief from the crushing austerity of the war years. Relief also came in the cultural arena, where the harshest measures of the previous decade, in terms of access to entertainment, dress codes, and gender segregation, were relaxed. The gender apartheid regime, imposing drastic inequality on women, remained in place, but millions of women waged legal and political campaigns and daily life struggles to chip away at its edges. Even some modest political \"liberalization\" was noticeable, as a cautious discourse of reform began to emerge, partly as a political safety valve. Reformist Mohammad Khatami handily won the 1997 Iranian presidential election and launched a charm offensive in foreign policy. Diplomatic relations with the outside world improved and, by the end of the decade, a modest dtente with the United States seemed possible. A thaw in Washington-Tehran relations was apparent when reformist Mohammad Khatami handily won the 1997 presidential election and launched a charm offensive in foreign policy, replacing Khomeinis belligerence with proposals for a peaceful \"Dialogue of Civilizations.\" Still, the United States never lifted economic sanctions, adding instead a new embargo on Irans energy sector a policy largely pushed by the powerful Israel lobby in Washington. Changing its previous position as the Islamic Republics silent military ally, Israel during the 1990s designated Iran as its existential enemy. The excuse was Irans sponsorship of \"terrorism,\" meaning its support for resistance to Israeli military incursions into Lebanon and Syria. In reality, while it was comfortably perpetuating its occupation of Palestinian lands, Israel needed to fabricate an \"existential threat,\" something that none of the conveniently docile neighboring Arab regimes could be said to pose. With its blustering but empty rhetoric, the Islamic Republic perfectly fitted the role of Israels ultimate nemesis, just as the Jewish state occupied precisely the same symbolic place in the Islamic Republics propaganda.\n\nFrom 9/11 to the Green Movement In 1999, the Khatami-era reform movement came to a halt with a harsh crackdown on university students demonstrating in defense of press freedom. Khatami survived to serve a second term, but it was clear that the Iranian \"deep state\" would not tolerate structural reforms. The failure of reforms under Khatami imposed closures on the first postrevolutionary generations political horizons. The discourse of reform continued, providing the regime with a tolerant faade and encouraging participation in presidential and parliamentary elections. But the fundamentals of domestic and foreign policy never changed, even when the reformists had a president or parliamentary majority on their side. Meanwhile, the window of dtente with the United States was closed after September 11, 2001, when President George W. Bushs \"Axis of Evil\" rhetoric placed Iran next to Iraq on the enemy list of Americas \"war on terror.\" Ironically, once again, this came at a time when the Islamic Republic was quietly cooperating with Washington against the al-Qaeda network and even offering assistance in the US war on the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Realpolitik, however, could not stand in the way of the Israel lobby and its neocon allies in the Bush administration who wanted Iran on top of the list of US regime-change targets via military intervention. By the early 2000s, the Israel-neocon lobby was zeroing in on Irans nuclear energy program, issuing dire warnings about the Islamic Republics impending atomic weapons capability. Unlike Israel, which built a nuclear arsenal in defiance of international law, Iran had signed the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty and kept its nuclear energy program largely within the purview of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The contrast did not matter to the Bush administration, which piled up \"crippling\" new sanctions on Iran, cutting it off from global financial and banking networks and imposing punitive sanctions on third-party countries doing business with Iran. The failure of reforms under Khatami imposed closures on the first postrevolutionary generations political horizons. On coming to office in 2008, Barack Obama began confidential communications with Irans Supreme Leader, moving toward a potential breakthrough that soon hit an obstacle as Iran plunged into another domestic crisis. In 2009, millions came out in protest as Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a second term in office, branding the result as fraudulent. This was Irans Green Movement, the largest mass protest in three decades, whose defiant slogan \"Where is My Vote?\" was subversive without calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. The regime responded by unleashing its private militia and security forces, killing dozens and arresting thousands, until protests gradually died down by early 2010. The crushing of the Green Movement underlined the point that popular dissent, even within the bounds set by the regime, would ultimately be met with violence. During his second term, Obama pursued a dual-track policy of toughening the sanctions on Iran while resuming secret negotiations with Tehran. In 2015, and despite the best efforts of Israel and Saudi Arabia, the Islamic Republic, the United States, and the other permanent UN Security Council members signed a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Tehran agreed to close international monitoring of its nuclear energy program in exchange for a gradual rollback of the most onerous sanctions.\n\nA New Protest Cycle However, before Irans economy and its battered citizens could experience significant relief, the incoming Donald Trump administration voided what he called the \"Obama deal,\" complying with Israeli-Saudi complaints about its \"leniency.\" Crippling international sanctions came back to exasperate the already crushing burdens on Iranians of their corrupt, crony-capitalist economy at home. Between the fall of 2017 and the winter of 2020, the regimes subsidy cutbacks and energy price rises led to countrywide violent protests with unprecedented levels of poor and working-class participation. At their peak in November 2019, the protests mobilized hundreds of thousands of indignant working-class Iranians, angrily facing up the governments deployment of tanks, helicopters, and machine guns in confrontations that, according to Amnesty International, led to over three hundred deaths. A 2020 study of the new protest cycle concluded: Political and economic protests are nothing new in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The country has seen various violent and non-violent protests over the last 40 years. However, the two major protests in December 2017 and November 2019 suggest that the prevailing dynamics of political protest in Iran are changing. There is an increasing sense of radicalization among protesters, while the state is prepared to resort to extreme violence to maintain control. The increasing radicalization could be the result of the political cul-de-sac, which stems from hopelessness over the prospects for meaningful change, either through reform and a democratic transition or else by economic progress. The concentration of power in unelected factions of the state guarded by the iron st of the armed and security forces, the dismal economic situation, the paralyzing corruption at every level, and the lack of accountability have increased the already existing crisis of legitimacy for a revolutionary regime which came to power to be on the side of \"the poor.\" This was a typical example of warnings that, given its volatile political and economic situation, the Islamic Republic should anticipate larger and angrier protests. Meanwhile, outside pressure mounted when the Trump administration killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and his entourage in a drone attack on Iraqi soil in January 2020. Soleimani was the commander of the operations of the Revolutionary Guards abroad and Irans most high-profile military figure with a relatively untainted reputation. Reacting meekly to this brazen assassination, Tehran fired missiles on American military bases in Iraq, sending warnings in advance to minimize damage. The year 2020 began with considerable unrest and instability, compounded by the anticipation of changes at the top. Attempts to gain public sympathy for Soleimanis murder dissolved when the Revolutionary Guards mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian airliner, killing its 176 passengers, most of whom were Iranians. The image of the force was badly tarnished, and protests broke out on the streets and on university campuses. The year 2020 began with considerable unrest and instability, compounded by the anticipation of changes at the top, as the regimes octogenarian leadership, including the Supreme Leader, had reached expiration age. The 2020 presidential election thus became an indication of how the regime might manage a political transition in the midst of an impending, multifaceted crisis. Its response was a posture of harshness and inflexibility. Departing from past practice, the reformists were barred from running, clearing the field for the election of the extreme right-wing figure Ebrahim Raisi, a cleric directly involved in the massacre of political prisoners in the late 1980s. Clearly, the regime no longer cared about electoral participation or even the pretense that the public had a choice. With half the electorate abstaining, Raisi received an official tally of 70 percent in other words, the approval of about a third of eligible voters, which was the lowest record in the Islamic Republics presidential elections. Iran experienced the COVID-19 pandemic under these conditions, with a glimmer of hope for sanctions relief emerging when the Biden administration resumed negotiations to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. However, months of talks did not go anywhere, and came to a halt when the recent wave of protests in Iran broke out.\n\nThe Crisis of 2022 By 2022, Iran was pulling out of the pandemic with no sanctions relief and a battered economy. The regimes relations with the United States and Europe were stalling at their worst, while its policy of \"turning to the East\" toward China and Russia had not reversed the economys downward spiral. Outside observers and purged reformists were warning of simmering, explosive discontent. The economy was in its worst shape in decades, with escalating inflation and unemployment hitting the poor and women the hardest. Astronomical class cleavages, corruption, and cronyism were more blatantly on display than ever, while rolling demonstrations by workers, teachers, and government pensioners were routine. Millions of young people, including university students and graduates, saw an ever-gloomier future ahead of them, with women facing the darkest prospects. On average more educated than men, Iranian women endured the double burden of gender apartheid and the feminization of poverty. For decades, tension had been mounting among Irans culturally repressed and economically deprived ethnic minorities, particularly in the countrys Kurdish, Baloch, and Arab peripheries. Last but not least, an environmental crisis of massive proportions, combining drought, water mismanagement, and deadly pollution, was virtually suffocating the country. The stage, therefore, was set for a perfect political storm of deep-rooted and multipronged discontent. Simply put, numerous forms and layers of social, economic, political, and cultural oppression had combined to produce unbearable burdens, leading to an explosion of countrywide protest. Looking through an admittedly blurry lens of class politics, we might discern a lineup of contending political \"blocs,\" roughly corresponding to different social strata. Historians agree that the social base of Irans political upheavals during the past century has been the notoriously ill-defined middle class. However, as was the case with the monarchy, the Islamic Republics relationship with the middle strata has been ambivalent, trying to buy them off with economic and lifestyle concessions, while denying them political representation. For decades, tension had been mounting among Irans culturally repressed and economically deprived ethnic minorities. The 2009 Green Movement was the most serious recent middle-class attempt at political intervention, which the regime was able to contain in part because the lower classes did not join it. The Islamic Republic has always claimed to represent the poor and the working and lower classes. At times, the regimes economic populist measures, buttressed perhaps by the appeal of religious ideology, afforded it active or tacit support from at least portions of the rural and urban poor and lower classes. That precarious balance, however, no longer seems to hold. The urban poors bloody 201720 uprisings, ongoing labor strikes, and the crushing burden of day-to-day survival suggest a new configuration where the poor and working classes might be ready to join the opposition. On the other side, we see no evidence of the regimes ability to mobilize a social base. Its repressive organs, the police, security forces, and plain-clothes militia, are paid professionals doing their jobs. During the recent protests, the regime did not bring out its supporters in notable counterdemonstrations, as it did in response to the Green Movement. Nor does the appeal to Islam, and the presumed religiosity of the masses, constitute the centerpiece of official discourse. The Supreme Leaders defensive rhetoric about the current crisis is thoroughly secular, refusing to acknowledge and redress political mistakes, and blaming the protests on conspiracies hatched abroad. This steadfast denial of reality reminds many observers of the monarchys response to its impending demise, when the Shah only conceded the reality of a revolutionary crisis when it was too late, a few months before his downfall.\n\nProvoking Revolt As with the monarchys blundering toward revolution, the Islamic Republic seems to have created both the preconditions and the triggering mechanism of the current crisis. The Raisi government set off the outburst by intensifying repressive cultural regulations, particularly on womens dress codes and mandatory hijab. In recent years, a few young women had challenged hijab rules by unveiling in public. Even the governments own studies had acknowledged that a large majority of women did not strictly observe the hijab, recommending a policy of noninterference. Ignoring this, the Raisi government ordered its morality police to impose strict hijab rules, publicly engaging in physical violence against women. As the number of casualties, including teenagers and children, multiplied, so did the anger and vehemence of the protests. If this approach was meant to bring about control through intimidation, it backfired, producing the opposite effect. Protests began with the now famous death in custody of a twenty-two-year-old Kurdish woman, Mahsa (Jina) Amini, who had been arrested for violating hijab laws. Her family claimed that she was murdered a charge that the government denied but was confirmed by an independent medical investigation. Soon, angry protests spread to several cities: they were particularly strong in Kurdish regions with a long history of repressed grievances. Then, in unprecedented acts of political defiance, more and more women across the country began to remove their headscarves, some burning them in public. The regime responded with violence, unleashing its anti-riot police and plain-clothes militia on protesters. As the number of casualties, including teenagers and children, multiplied, so did the anger and vehemence of the protests. Many slogans directly attacked the Supreme Leader, calling for the Islamic Republics downfall. In a marked difference from all past protests, the slogans were completely secular, except in southeastern Baloch regions, whose impoverished Sunni population suffered religious discrimination under a Shii Islamist state. As the use of deadly force seemed to backfire, the regime began to calibrate its deployment, focusing its firepower on the Sunni regions of Kurdistan and Sistan-Baluchistan. In Tehran and larger cities, live ammunition, rubber bullets, and batons were used against protesters, while police cars and motorcycles were driven into their midst. Still, protests grew and spread to university campuses and even to high schools. There has been some support for the protests by labor unions and civil society associations of journalists and lawyers, but nothing like a move toward a general strike is yet discernible. Leaderless and spontaneous, the protests continue, taking full advantage of digital technology to communicate and coordinate, as well as effectively broadcast their performance and demands. Despite the regimes media censorship and shutting down of the internet, a daily flood of moving images and information pour out of Iran, eliciting tremendous sympathy and support all over the world. Particularly strong is the emotional response of the Iranian diaspora in Europe, the United States, and Canada, where tens of thousands have come out to demonstrate support of the uprising in Iran.",

According to the Reuters news agency, Scholzs spokesperson said: The chancellor condemned in particular the Russian airstrikes against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and stressed Germanys determination to support Ukraine in ensuring its defence capability against Russian aggression. The Kremlin said Putin told Scholz the German and western line on Ukraine was \"destructive\" and urged Berlin to rethink its approach. Its readout of the call served to highlight the gulf between Russia and western governments over Ukraine, even though Moscow and Washington have both said in the past 24 hours they are open in principle to talks, Reuters reports. The Kremlin said: Attention was drawn to the destructive line of Western states, including Germany, which are pumping the Kyiv regime with weapons and training the Ukrainian military. All this, as well as comprehensive political and financial support for Ukraine, leads to the fact that Kyiv completely rejects the idea of any negotiations. Kyiv has said peace talks are possible only if Russia stops attacking Ukrainian territory and withdraws its troops from Ukrainian soil. The Kremlin has indicated it wants a diplomatic solution and claimed Putin had always been open to talks, but said this was complicated by Washingtons refusal to recognise \"the new territories\" as Russian was hindering a search for any potential compromise. Separately, a German government spokesperson confirmed Berlin is not in talks with Ukraine about the transfer or deployment of Patriot air defence systems there. Reuters reports that Germany offered Poland the Patriot system last month to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people. The Polish defence minister Mariusz Baszczak later asked Germany to send the fire units to Ukraine instead.\n\nUpdated at 11.47 EST\n\n2 Dec 2022 13.54 EST We are now closing the blog. Here is a summary of todays events: Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyivs presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyaks estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraines 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraines general staff. He said Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, would make the total public \"when the right moment comes\".\n\nThree people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson over the past 24 hours , the regional governor said.\n\nVladimir Putin is open to talks on a possible settlement in Ukraine but the refusal of the United States to recognise annexed territories as Russian is hindering a search for any potential compromise, the Kremlin said. US president Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was prepared to speak to Putin if the Kremlin chief was looking for a way to end the war but that Putin had not yet indicated that.\n\nRussian-installed authorities in Ukraines southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka , on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday.\n\nEuropean Union member states have agreed to put a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian oil after Poland, which was holding out, gave the green light to the deal. In an effort to reduce the Kremlins income from fossil fuels, the EU has agreed to limit the amount that can be paid for seaborne oil to diminish Moscows ability to finance its war in Ukraine.\n\nRussian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the countrys museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers organisation PEN.\n\nGermany is aiming to deliver seven Gepard tanks that had been destined for the scrap pile to Ukraine this spring, adding to 30 of the air-defence tanks that are already being used to fight against the Russian army, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday.\n\nThe Finish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help it is not resilient enough .\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europes biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraines electricity before Russias invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times, Reuters reported.\n\nThe United States is reportedly working with two Middle Eastern countries to shift advanced Nasams air defence systems to Ukraine in the next three to six months. Kyiv received two of the eight approved deliveries of Nasams in early November.\n\nRussias withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River last month has provided the Ukrainian armed forces with opportunities to strike additional Russian logistics nodes and lines of communication, the UKs Ministry of Defence has suggested. This threat is likely to have prompted Russian logisticians to relocate supply nodes, including rail transfer points, further south and east, the latest British intelligence report states.\n\nRussia tested a new missile defence system rocket, its defence ministry said today. The missile was launched from the Sary Shagan testing range in Kazakhstan. Other than saying the test was successful, the ministry gave few other details.\n\nThe chief economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on BP to exit Russia entirely after the fossil fuel firm was offered a 580m dividend by the oil giant Rosneft. Oleg Ustenko has written to BPs chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand the British company cuts ties with the state-controlled Russian firm nine months after announcing its intention to leave the country.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury has said there must be \"no way we force peace\" in Ukraine . Justin Welby added that the need for support is going to be \"very long term\", the Press Association reported.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron presented a united front on Ukraine with Biden saying he would talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is willing to end the war and only in consultation with Nato allies. \"Im prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding hes looking for a way to end the war. He hasnt done that yet,\" Biden told a news conference at the White House with Macron on Thursday.\n\nBiden and Macron pledged to hold Russia accountable for \"widely documented atrocities and war crimes\" in Ukraine. Biden said their support would continue in the face of Russian aggression. In a joint statement, the leaders said: \"Intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.\" Ukrainian refugees will spend a further five months on a ship which has been accommodating them since June this year, the Scottish Government has confirmed.\n\n2 Dec 2022 13.47 EST MS Victoria is providing temporary accommodation to Ukrainian refugees. Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA Ukrainian refugees will spend a further five months on a ship which has been accommodating them since June this year, the Scottish Government has confirmed. MS Victoria, which is docked in Leith, Edinburgh, will continue to provide \"safe accommodation for displaced people\" until June 2023 with the option to extend. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton, however, accused the Scottish Government of \"quietly\" extending the contract, according to reports by LBC on Friday. On Friday evening, Mr Cole-Hamilton told the PA news agency: This isnt a new life, its a new limbo. Ukrainian refugees deserve a long-term solution. I spoke to aid workers, working in Lviv, connecting Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Scotland with homes and routes out of Ukraine, who have described the Scottish Government as being humiliatingly underprepared. They wanted the kudos of throwing open their doors but they did none of the groundwork. I dont think when these Ukrainians are fleeing unimaginable atrocities at the hands of the Russians, I dont think they dreamed about a very crowded passenger ship.\" Appropriate long-term accommodation is yet to be identified. Minister with Special Responsibility for Refugees from Ukraine Neil Gray said: We do not want people to spend any longer than is absolutely necessary in temporary welcome accommodation, however, we know from speaking to those on board the MS Victoria that it is a safe environment that has built a powerful sense of community. Weve extended the contract with the MS Victoria to continue to safely accommodate arrivals from Ukraine. Work continues to match people in temporary accommodation with hosts and matching teams are operating on board both ships.\"\n\n2 Dec 2022 13.12 EST A theatre destroyed in Mariupol in March. The Russian word for \"children\" is written on the pavement. Photograph: Reuters Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the countrys museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers organisation PEN. The report stated: Culture is not collateral damage in the war against Ukraine; its a target, a central pillar of Russian President Vladimir Putins justification for the war. Putin has repeatedly claimed that Ukrainian culture and language simply dont exist. By targeting art museums, music halls, libraries, theaters and historical sites, he attempts to make it so.\" PEN cited Ukraines Ministry of Culture as saying that 529 \"cultural heritage and cultural institutions\" have been destroyed or damaged since the war started. The figure includes both sites of national importance and cultural venues in towns and villages, the report said. The list includes the bombing in March of a theatre in Mariupol, where hundreds of people were sheltering. Around 600 people died in the attack, according to an Associated Press investigation. The PEN report said Russian soldiers have also seized and destroyed Ukrainian literature and Ukrainian-language books from public libraries in occupied regions. However, it acknowledged \"it is not always possible to determine if the bombings of cultural sites are deliberate or the result of Russias indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas.\" PEN Ukraine said it has documented 31 civilian writers, artists and other cultural workers killed in Russian attacks this year, and that some other cultural figures have died while fighting with Ukrainian forces. American author and publisher Dave Eggers, part of the PEN delegation that presented the report, said: The irony of Putins attempts to erase the culture and heritage of Ukraine [is it] has only enriched their culture and made the world pay attention and be far more interested in Ukrainian writers and traditions.\"\n\n2 Dec 2022 12.29 EST Andrew Roth A dog with a lit-up collar walks in a street during a blackout in Kyiv last month. Photograph: Andrew Kravchenko/AP The Kremlin thought it would sweep across Ukraine and take Kyiv in a matter of days. Now, more than nine months into its disastrous war with Ukraine, the new Russian strategy of targeting the infrastructure that brings light, heat and water into millions of Ukrainian homes has revealed Russias own weakness and its desperation in the face of a defiant Ukrainian resistance. Russias impotence and the scale of the destruction wrought by Moscow against territory it considers its own has leaked back into official statements, even as the Kremlin seeks to leave Ukraine in a dire state on the cusp of a bitter winter. At moments, Russian officials have compared the destruction in Ukrainian cities and its strategy to that of the second world war, nearly portraying the strategy as one of scorched earth. At a press conference on Thursday, the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was given a tough question about Russias shelling of Kherson, a city it claimed to annex in September and then fled from in November, and now regularly shells from across the banks of the Dnipro River. \"How can you justify missile attacks on the civilian population, infrastructure, depriving people of access to water and electricity, including in the area of Kherson, which Russia considers its territory?\" he was asked. \"The city of Stalingrad was our territory,\" replied Lavrov, referring to the modern city of Volgograd that was stage to the deadliest battle of the second world war. \"We hit the Germans such that they ran away from there.\" Moscows current strategy stands in stark contrast to Russias initial plan: a shock-and-awe strike on Kyiv and other cities that would let them take over the country and its key infrastructure within weeks. Read the full analysis here. Russias vicious tactics in Ukraine serve only to further expose its weakness Read more\n\n2 Dec 2022 11.42 EST Russian oil output could fall by 500,000 to 1m barrels per day early in 2023 after the European Union imposes a ban on seaborne imports from Monday, two sources at major Russian producers have told the Reuters news agency. The estimate is at the lower end of market analysts forecasts of the combined impact of the ban and a proposed price cap on Russian oil, although the sources said the true level would depend on several factors yet to be settled. They requested anonymity to discuss sensitive market dynamics connected with the conflict in Ukraine that Russia calls a \"special military operation\", Reuters said. Alexei Kokin of Otkritie brokerage broadly agreed with their assessment of the likely impact of Western measures on Russian output. Its roughly the same as the volume of seaborne supplies to the EU in recent weeks. I dont think they (Russian producers) will be able to divert that elsewhere. The west wants to squeeze Russias finances to reduce its ability to fund the conflict. Exports of crude, gas and oil products account for the majority of Russias revenues, which have stayed high as disruption to production and sales following western sanctions has been more than offset by high prices on international markets. Russias budget revenues from oil and gas jumped by over a third in the first 10 months of the year. Before the Ukraine conflict began on 24 February, Russia exported around 8m bpd of oil and oil products.\n\n2 Dec 2022 10.58 EST Turkey expects a \"clear picture\" on the war by next spring, its foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said, as fighting continued and Putin indicated he was open to negotiations. According to Reuters, he said: Now Ukraine is advancing on the ground, retaking some of their occupied territories. But Russia in return is deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure. So life is getting difficult for Ukrainians particularly, and for all of us. I think before the spring time we will have clear picture about ceasefire or truce or negotiation table. But we will not give up. As Turkey we will continue our efforts. Russias war against Ukraine became more complicated with the fighting on the ground getting heavier, Cavusoglu said, adding that some Western countries should do more to get two sides to the negotiation table.\n\n2 Dec 2022 10.41 EST Olena Zelenska, the wife of the Ukrainian president, has urged the UK and other western nations not to allow themselves to become accustomed to her countrys plight. Speaking to the Times, she has said: It is quite understandable that the west is tired. However, this phrase, I hear it quite a lot war fatigue is quite a dangerous phrase for us because that is exactly what our adversary wants. They expect people to forget and the world to get tired of the sad news and for Ukraine to disappear from the front pages. They would then feel they had the permission to do what they want. As winter draws in, she accused the Russians of trying to terrorise Ukrainians into believing they will not be able to survive. It would be wrong to say these things dont scare us, they do, but we know we must endure this. The winter is treacherous and that is what they are counting on, its not the first time they are using the force of nature against the civilian population. She also detailed how she has cut off all contact with any Russian relative or acquaintance, telling the paper: Of course, Putin is to blame but without the support of the Russian people he couldnt have done it on such a scale I have relatives [in Russia], but we dont communicate. Those relationships have ended completely There will be no point in returning to those dialogues, when your own life and childrens and your familys is in great danger and people dont even ask if you are still alive, I think such relationships are over.\n\n2 Dec 2022 09.40 EST UN-appointed investigators are looking into whether Russias attacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine amount to war crimes, one of the inspection team said on Friday. Russia has been pounding Ukraines electricity infrastructure since early October, causing blackouts and leaving millions without heating as temperatures plummet, Reuters reported. Russia says the assaults do not target civilians and are meant to reduce Ukraines ability to fight and push it to negotiate though Kyiv says such attacks are a war crime. \"Part of the analysis that we are engaged in at present is whether the attacks constitute war crimes,\" Pablo de Greiff told a news conference, speaking from Kyiv. If they do, the team would work out what it \"can do in order to make a contribution to the accountability for such crimes,\" he added. The three-member commission of inquiry established by the UN Human Rights Council in March has already concluded that Russia committed war crimes in areas it occupied in Ukraine. Moscow regularly dismisses such accusations as a smear campaign.\n\n2 Dec 2022 09.27 EST Julian Borger When Alina Trebushnikova woke up on Thursday morning, the light was on and she knew the day had already got off to a bad start. The electricity in her neighbourhood of Novomoskovsk had returned in the middle of the night and that meant it would not be on for much longer. As a result, the little house would be colder and darker for much of the day. It gets dark by 4pm in Ukraine now and temperatures hover just below zero after nightfall. Next week a deep frost is expected and the days will grow even shorter, as Ukrainians approach their hardest winter since the second world war. Alinas husband, Oleksii, was away at his construction job and would only return long after dark. Their two boys, nine-year-old Ilia and Yakov, three years younger, were at the home of Alinas parents, who have a wood stove, independent of the vagaries of the grid. Alina is 31 and has lived in Novomoskovsk since she was seven, when her parents moved out of a block of flats in nearby Dnipro to live closer to the earth, as they put it. She now spends most of her days alone with Polina, born three months ago, while making food for the family, juggling with limited light, heat and ingredients. There are no lights, its scary: a family prepares for winter in eastern Ukraine Read more\n\n2 Dec 2022 09.20 EST Ukrainian embassy in Madrid receives 'bloody package' Spanish police have cordoned off the area surrounding the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid after it received a \"bloody package\" similar to the ones sent to other embassies abroad, Ukraines foreign ministry said. This comes after a spate of six letter bombs targeted high-profile targets in Spain related to the war in Ukraine, including the United States embassy, prime minister Pedro Snchez, the defence minister, an arms manufacturer, an airbase and a European satellite centre. On Friday, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said several of the countrys embassies abroad have received \"bloody packages\" containing animal eyes.\n\n2 Dec 2022 08.15 EST EU proposes fines and jail terms for breaking Russia sanctions Companies who break EU sanctions against Russia face fines of at least 5% of their worldwide turnover, under proposals put forward by the European commission. The plan, which needs approval from the European parliament and the EUs 27 member states before it can take effect, also said individuals breaking EU sanctions would face potential jail terms of at least five years, Reuters reports. Breaking sanctions on Russia is already a criminal offence in some EU countries, but in others it is treated as an administrative offence and penalties vary across the bloc. The Justice commissioner Didier Reynders said the proposed rules would bring clarity, adding: Too many gaps still remain between member states when it comes to the punishment of violation of EU sanctions.",

                "cc_text": "WASHINGTON Russia freed WNBA star Brittney Griner on Thursday in a high-profile prisoner exchange, as the U.S. released notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout but failed to win freedom for another American, Paul Whelan, who has been jailed for nearly four years.\n\nThe deal, the second in eight months amid tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, secured the release of the most prominent American detained abroad and achieved a top policy goal for President Joe Biden. But it carried what U.S. officials described as a heavy price.\n\n\"Shes safe, shes on a plane, shes on her way home,\" Biden said from the White House, where he was accompanied by Griner's wife, Cherelle, and administration officials.\n\nBiden's authorization to release Bout, the Russian felon once nicknamed \"the Merchant of Death,\" underscored the heightened urgency that his administration faced to get Griner home, particularly after the recent resolution of her criminal case on drug charges and subsequent transfer to a penal colony.\n\nGriner is a two-time Olympic gold medalist and Phoenix Mercury pro basketball star, whose arrest in February made her the most high-profile American jailed abroad. Her status as an openly gay Black woman, locked up in a country where authorities have been hostile to the LBGTQ community, injected racial, gender and social dynamics into her legal saga and brought unprecedented attention to the population of wrongful detainees.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed the swap, saying in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that the exchange took place in Abu-Dhabi and that Bout had been flown home.\n\nBiden spoke with Griner who was at an airport in Abu-Dhabi after she was greeted by U.S. officials. She was expected to be back in the U.S. within 24 hours, Biden said. U.S. officials said she would be offered specialized medical services and counseling, but declined to go into specifics citing privacy concerns.\n\nBoth Russian and U.S. officials had conveyed cautious optimism in recent weeks after months of strained negotiations, with Biden saying in November that he was hopeful that Russia would engage in a deal now that the midterm elections were completed. A top Russian official said last week that a deal was possible before year's end.\n\nEven so, the fact that the deal was a one-for-one swap was a surprise given that U.S. officials had for months expressed their their determination to bring home both Griner and Paul Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive jailed in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the U.S. government has said are baseless.\n\n\"Weve not forgotten about Paul Whelan,\" Biden said. \"We will keep negotiating in good faith for Pauls release.\"\n\nU.S. officials said they did not see an immediate path to bringing about Whelan's release, saying Russia has treated his case differently because of the \"sham espionage\" charges against him. Still, they said they believe communications channels with the Russians remain open for negotiations for his freedom to continue though it was not yet clear what cost would need to be paid to secure it.\n\nWhelan's brother David said in a statement he was \"so glad\" for Griners release but also disappointed for his family. He credited the White House with giving the Whelan family advance notice and said he did not fault officials for making the deal.\n\n\"The Biden Administration made the right decision to bring Ms. Griner home, and to make the deal that was possible, rather than waiting for one that wasnt going to happen,\" he said.\n\nIn releasing Bout, the U.S. freed a former Soviet Army lieutenant colonel whom the Justice Department once described as one of the world's most prolific arms dealers. Bout, whose exploits inspired a Hollywood movie, was serving a 25-year sentence on charges that he conspired to sell tens of millions of dollars in weapons that U.S officials said were to be used against Americans. Biden issued an executive grant of clemency to free the arms dealer from a federal prison in Illinois to effect the prisoner swap.\n\nThe exchange was carried out despite deteriorating relations between the powers prompted by Moscows war against Ukraine.\n\nOver the summer, the imprisonment of Americans produced a rare diplomatic opening, yielding the highest-level known contact between Washington and Moscow a phone call between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in more than five months.\n\nIn an extraordinary move during otherwise secret negotiations, Blinken revealed publicly in July that the U.S. had made a \"substantial proposal\" to Russia for Griner and Whelan. Though he did not specify the terms, people familiar with it said the U.S. had offered Bout.\n\nSuch a public overture drew a chiding rebuke from the Russians, who said they preferred to resolve such cases in private, and carried the risk of weakening the U.S. government's negotiating hand for this and future deals by making the administration appear too desperate. But the announcement was also meant to communicate to the public that Biden was doing what he could and to ensure pressure on the Russians.\n\nBesides the efforts of U.S. officials, the release also followed months of back channel negotiations involving Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a frequent emissary in hostage talks, and his top deputy, Mickey Bergman.\n\nGriner was arrested at the Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport in February when customs officials said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage. She pleaded guilty in July, though still faced trial because admitting guilt in Russia's judicial system does not automatically end a case.\n\nShe acknowledged in court that she possessed the canisters, but said she had no criminal intent and said their presence in her luggage was due to hasty packing.\n\nBefore being sentenced on Aug. 4 and receiving a punishment her lawyers said was out of line for the offense, an emotional Griner apologized \"for my mistake that I made and the embarrassment that I brought on them.\" She added: \"I hope in your ruling it does not end my life.\"\n\nHer supporters had largely stayed quiet for weeks after her arrest, but that approach changed in May once the State Department designated her as unlawfully detained. A separate trade, Marine veteran Trevor Reed for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot convicted in the U.S. in a cocaine trafficking conspiracy, spurred hope that additional such exchanges could be in the works.\n\nWhelan has been held in Russia since December 2018. The U.S. government also classified him as wrongfully detained. He was sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in prison.\n\nWhelan was not included in the Reed prisoner swap, escalating pressure on the Biden administration to ensure that any deal that brought home Griner also included him.\n\nAssociated Press writers Colleen Long and Aamer Madhani contributed to this report.",

Repairs on the railroad portion of the bridge are expected to be completed in 6-7 months, authorities said.\n\nUkraine hinted at responsibility for the attack but never fully acknowledged involvement. Russian authorities blamed Ukraine's intelligence service and responded with several waves of missile and drone strikes that have battered Ukraines energy facilities and other key infrastructure.\n\nThe bridge links Russias mainland with the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine officials have vowed to take back Crimea.\n\nONLY 25% OF RUSSIANS SUPPORT WAR:Ukraine wants price cap on Russian oil cut in half\n\nOther developments:\n\nThe European Union's ninth package of sanctions on Russia since it launched the war would target the country's drone sector, which has played a major role in attacks that have ravaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Bloomberg reported. The sanctions may be approved next week.\n\nUkraine has reclaimed 54% of the territory taken by Russia since the beginning of the war, but the occupying forces still control 18% of Ukrainian land, including Crimea and a part of the Donbas region that has been contested since 2014, the British Defense Ministry said.\n\nThe $200 million mega-yacht seized from Viktor Medvedchuk, an Ukrainian oligarch who's a close ally of Putin, will be auctioned and the proceeds will go to the Ukrainian government, which announced the decision in a news release.\n\nA 25,000-ton shipment of grain, part of Ukraine's initiative, has arrived in Djibouti for delivery to neighboring Ethiopia.

The base houses long-range flight tankers that serve to refuel bombers in the air.\n\nAuthorities in the Saratov region said an explosion struck the area of the Engels air base, which houses Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers that have been involved in launching strikes on Ukraine. Those bombers are capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The Ukraine military said it had reports that two Russian servicemen were injured and two planes damaged.\n\n\"No matter how much the enemy wants (to blame Ukraine forces), we haven't started anything yet,\" said Yuriy Ignat, the spokesman of the Ukraine Air Force Command. \"They have to scratch their heads, think, how and who did it, how did it happen?\"\n\nOdesa's 1 million people without water after Russian missile strike\n\nHours after the explosions at the Russian air bases, cities across Ukraine faced another massive bombardment of Russian missiles Monday. The assault prompted widespread power outages and left Odesa, a Black Sea city of almost 1 million people, without running water. Air raid alerts sounded across the country, and authorities urged people to take shelter.\n\nUkraines air force said it shot down more than 60 of about 70 missiles, but national electricity supplier Ukrenergo said emergency blackouts began almost everywhere and that efforts to restore power began immediately.\n\nIn Odesa, the local water supply company said a missile strike cut power to pumping stations, shutting down the entire system. In the Kyiv province, about 40% of residents were left without power, the Kyiv Independent reported.\n\n\"Russians are terrorists who have nothing to do with civilization and human values!\" Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidents office, wrote on Telegram.\n\nMoldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said the Russian airstrikes could also cause power outages in her country.\n\nPrice cap on Russian oil goes into effect as Moscow threatens to cut supplies\n\nGlobal oil prices rose Monday as a West-imposed $60-per-barrel limit on Russian oil took effect. Russia said it would cut production before accepting the cap.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the U.S., which is not nearly as dependent on Russian oil as Europe, would work with its EU partners to maintain stability in the market if Moscow reduces supplies.\n\n\"Not surprised by that reaction by Russia,'' Kirby said. \"We again believe that this price cap could make a difference in limiting Mr. Putin's ability to profit exorbitantly off of the oil market and then turn that revenue around to kill more Ukrainians. It was never designed to take Russian oil off the market.''\n\nIndia is among countries saying it will continue paying for Russian oil though at a discount from the international benchmark Brent crude price of $87.30 per barrel.\n\nEU, international court clash over how to prosecute Putin\n\nThe chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court rejected a European Union proposal to create a U.N.-backed special tribunal to prosecute crimes in Ukraine. Karim Khan said the ICC is capable of dealing with war crimes committed in Ukraine, including prosecution of high-ranking political figures. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced her plan last week amid concerns Russian President Vladimir Putin could avoid prosecution for the crime of aggression under ICC rules. Khan said his office could prosecute Putin for war crimes or genocide if found appropriate.\n\nLiz Evenson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch, expressed support for the ICC investigation.\n\n\"The serious international crimes being committed in Ukraine and elsewhere demonstrate once again the importance of the ICCs promise of accountability and the courts crucial role,\" Evenson said.\n\nGermany will upgrade military to counter Russian threat\n\nThe German government will soon unveil a new national security strategy aimed at becoming one of the main providers of security in Europe in the face of Russian aggression, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an article for the Foreign Affairs magazine. He warned that current threats include assaults on allied territory, cyberwarfare and even the \"remote chance\" of a nuclear attack.\n\nThe plan calls for strengthening the European defense industry, beefing up the military presence on NATOs eastern flank and training and equipping Ukraines armed forces, Scholz said. He confirmed his government's plans to buy U.S. F-35 fighter jets.\n\n\"For the last three decades, decisions regarding Germanys security and the equipment of the countrys armed forces were taken against the backdrop of a Europe at peace,\" Scholz wrote. \"Now, the guiding question will be which threats we and our allies must confront in Europe, most immediately from Russia.\"\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, USA TODAY; The Associated Press",

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\nMultiple attacks targeting Russian military infrastructure this week have focused attention on Ukraines efforts to develop longer-range combat drones.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry says the strikes on two air bases Monday followed by an attack on an air field Tuesday were carried out by Ukrainian drones, which it claims were brought down by Russian air defenses. Imagery, both satellite and photographs, indicates some damage was done to Russian military planes at one base in Ryazan region.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry has offered no official comment on the explosions, and the Ukrainian government has not acknowledged adding long-range attack drones to its arsenal. However, a top Ukrainian official has tweeted a cryptic message hinting at the possibility that Kyiv was indeed behind the attacks.\n\n\"The Earth is round discovery made by Galileo. Astronomy was not studied in Kremlin, giving preference to court astrologers. If it was, they would know: if something is launched into other countries airspace, sooner or later unknown flying objects will return to departure point,\" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak posted.\n\nState-owned weapons manufacturer Ukroboronprom has indicated several times in the last few weeks that it is close to finishing work on a new long-range drone.\n\nIn October, it posted on Facebook along with an image of what appeared to be part of the drones structure: \"Range is 1000 km (621 miles), weight of the combat unit is 75 kg (165 pounds). Putting the final touches on this one.\"\n\nA month later, on November 24, Ukroboronprom published another post: \"The next stage of UAV testing On behalf of the Chief of the General Staff, we are getting ready for flight tests under the action of electronic warfare.\"\n\n\"Weather, on the one hand, becomes a problem, and on the other hand its an additional test for the complex. A kind of crash test.\"\n\nA photo showed the words \"az vozdam\" inscribed on what was purported to be the drone meaning \"I will repay.\"\n\nAnd on Saturday, company spokeswoman Natalia Sad was reported by news agency Ukrinform to have told Ukrainian television that \"a number of stages of successful tests have been completed.\"\n\n\"In accordance with the instructions of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we are moving to the stage of tests involving an e-warfare jamming environment,\" she added.\n\nHowever, there is no public indication that the drone in question has been readied for deployment or was involved in explosions inside Russia.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a drone strike occurred at an air field in Russias Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, according to the regional governor.\n\n\"As a result of a drone attack, an oil tanker caught fire near Kursk airfield. There were no casualties. The fire is being localized. Emergency services are working at the site,\" the regions governor Roman Starovoit said on Telegram.\n\nThe Kursk Region official Telegram channel said that Moscow Railways was helping put the \"fire out at the airport.\"\n\nStarovoit also said on Telegram that he had held a meeting of the \"anti-terrorist commission\" and decided to \"extend the yellow level of terrorist danger\" for another 15 days.\n\nA subsequent message added that classes at two schools were canceled following the incident.\n\nThe strike came one day after Russia blamed Ukraine for drone strikes on two Russian military air bases.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that Ukraine used drones to attack two Russian military airfields on Monday morning, adding that its air defenses intercepted the attacks \"in the Saratov and Ryazan regions,\" according to a statement carried on the official Russian news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe two bases, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, are hundreds of miles inside Russian territory and beyond the reach of Ukraines declared arsenal of drones. No footage or images of the remnants of drones have been published.\n\nIn the western Russian city of Engels, around 500 miles (more than 800 kilometers) southeast of Moscow, CCTV footage appeared to show an explosion lighting up the sky at around 6 a.m. local time on Monday morning.\n\nThe port city is home to Engels-2 airfield, a strategic bomber airbase, which was approximately 3.7 miles (nearly 6 kilometers) from where the CCTV footage was recorded.\n\nSaratov region Governor Roman Busargin reassured residents on Telegram that no civilian infrastructure was damaged but said \"information about incidents at military facilities is being checked by law enforcement agencies.\"\n\nHe acknowledged information about \"about a loud bang and a burst in Engels in the early morning\" was spreading on social networks and the media.",

(Video: Storyful)\n\nListen 7 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save\n\nRIGA, Latvia A drone strike attributed to Ukraine rocked an airfield inside Russia on Tuesday, demonstrating once again Ukraines ability to reach into Russian territory one day after its forces struck two other air bases hundreds of miles inside Russia. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The attacks have revealed major vulnerabilities in Russias air defenses and sent a signal to Moscow that its strategic assets far from the active combat zone are not off limits to the emboldened Ukrainian military.\n\nOfficials in the Russian city of Kursk, just north of Ukraine, said the Tuesday drone attack set an oil storage tank ablaze at an airfield.\n\nThe two airfields struck by drones on Monday the Engels-2 base in the Saratov region and the Dyagilevo base in Ryazan, a few hours drive from Moscow are home to jet bombers that can carry conventional missiles used to target Ukrainian infrastructure but can also carry nuclear weapons and normally serve as an important component of Russias strategic nuclear deterrent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine did not officially claim responsibility for the attacks and has been deliberately cryptic about its role in several explosions at strategically important Russian military sites in recent months.\n\nBut a senior Ukrainian official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive operation, told The Washington Post on Tuesday that all three attacks were carried out by Ukrainian drones.\n\n\"These were Ukrainian drones very successful, very effective,\" the official said of the strikes. The official added that the Russians have \"sowed the seeds of anger, and theyll reap the whirlwind.\"\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry blamed the Monday attacks on Kyiv but said the damage done was minimal.\n\nBritains ministry of defense said Tuesday that \"if Russia assesses the incidents were deliberate attacks, it will probably consider them as some of the most strategically significant failures of force protection since its invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts not clear how Ukrainian forces carried out the attack, what drones were used, and whether they were launched from Ukrainian territory or inside Russia with the help of special operations teams closer to the targets. Military experts closely monitoring Russian activities were also left puzzled by the drones success in evading Russian air defenses.\n\n\"Russia prides itself on being ready for a NATO strike against the country by having a lot of aerial assets and precision-guided munitions. So if thats the case, then how did this happen?\" asked Samuel Bendett, a military analyst at the Virginia-based research group CNA, speaking in an interview.\n\n\"Maybe this points to some of the bigger issues within the Russian air defense; maybe theyre not as secure, modern as they think,\" Bendett added. \"Whatever air defense assets located in Russia proper probably did not anticipate that an attack like that could be possible.\"\n\nThe Russian military said Ukraine had used a \"Soviet-era made\" unmanned aerial vehicle. Alexander Kots, a prominent military correspondent with the Kremlin-friendly newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, said the Engels airfield was hit by a Soviet Tu-141 Strizh drone, which uses technology from the 1970s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If Russian radar and air defenses could not defeat a Tu-141 that flew hundreds of miles from hitting its main air base for its strategic bombers in a war setting, that doesnt bode well for its ability to stop a mass cruise missile strike,\" Rob Lee, a Russia military expert and a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said in a tweet.\n\nUkraine still has some Tu-141s in storage and could have enhanced its capability for a one-way mission, Bendett said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nBut the strikes also turned attention to Ukraines own drone program and recent efforts to develop its own long-range combat UAVs.\n\nUkraines state weapons producer Ukroboronprom revealed last month that it is testing a new strike drone with a range up to 1000 km (621 miles) and a load weight of 75 kg (165 pounds). \"The next stage of UAV testing on behalf of the Chief of the General Staff, we are getting ready for flight tests under the action of electronic warfare,\" the company said in a Facebook post on Nov. 24.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no evidence that a new drone was used in the attacks, but Bendett says it may have been something more advanced than a Soviet-era drone.\n\n\"Russians want to minimize Ukrainian defense achievements, and thats why theyre saying they just repurposed an old clunker or the blueprint. But this may have been something else, something more sophisticated,\" he said.\n\nIf Ukraine has indeed developed the capacity to strike so far inside Russia, this will be deeply worrying for the Russians, Western officials said Tuesday. The attack on the Engels base is particularly significant, in part, because this may force Russia to disperse the long-range bombers it has stationed there to other locations.\n\n\"It certainly makes the Russians less confident that anywhere is safe. Psychologically it strikes a blow,\" one Western official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive subjects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly alluded to his countrys vast nuclear arsenal, making veiled threats that he is prepared to resort to extreme measures to deter Western involvement in the war or as retaliation if Ukraine targets critical infrastructure inside Russia. The vulnerability of strategic sites to relatively simple drone technology may change the way Western leaders perceive these threats.\n\nAside from the symbolism of striking airfields linked to Russias nuclear deterrent, the attacks may have immediate effects on Moscows strategy on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\n\"In the practical sense, this is a serious and imminent problem for the Russian Defense Ministry,\" Ruslan Leviev, an analyst with Conflict Intelligence Team, said in a daily video briefing. \"Ideally theyd need to put more air defense systems, but the problem both Russia and Ukraine face is that they have a finite number of these.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeviev recalled reports that Moscow has relocated some of its defense systems previously supplied to Syria to help cover forces on Russias nearly thousand-mile-long front line.\n\n\"Even for remote airfields, of which Russia has not one or two, there is just no additional defense systems and they are simply left unprotected,\" Leviev said. \"So you either leave your bases vulnerable or you move some of the air defense systems from the front line, and both options are bad.\"\n\nHours after the Monday attacks, Moscow launched an eighth wave of massive missile strikes against Ukraine that appear aimed at depriving the country of heating and electricity in bitterly cold weather.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking to reporters Tuesday in Washington, noted that Ukrainian civilians were coming under attack regularly by Russian forces, as is Ukrainians energy grid. Asked whether he thought Ukrainian strikes into Russia were morally justified, Blinken said the United States had \"neither encouraged nor enabled\" Kyiv to launch strikes inside Russian territory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nState Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters: \"We have not provided Ukraine with weapons to use inside of Russia. Weve been very clear that these are defensive supplies.\" He continued, \"We are not enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. We are not encouraging Ukraine to strike beyond its borders.\"\n\nAsked at the same news conference whether the United States was working to prevent Ukraine from developing its own ability to strike inside Russia, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said: \"No. Absolutely not.",

Russias defense ministry blamed Kyivs forces for the two blasts Monday, in which it said three \"maintenance personnel\" died and two planes were damaged.\n\nAnalysts were cautious about the military impact of the apparent attacks on strategic sites far from the front lines, but said they had further undermined Russian confidence in the country's air defenses while providing a timely morale boost for Ukrainian civilians preparing for a long winter under bombardment.\n\n\"The signaling is important for the Ukrainians: They need to know that they are hitting back, given the amount of pain and devastation and general discomfort thats being meted out in Ukraine,\" Matthew Ford, an associate professor at the Swedish Defense University in Stockholm, told NBC News.\n\n\"Its important from a morale point of view that some Russian strategic resources are being targeted.\"\n\nRussia has the firepower to carry on bombing Ukraine, he added. \"It might be a pain, but they can relocate aircraft and infrastructure, they can put up more security around air bases.\"\n\nThe attacks were inflicted, the Kremlin said, by \"Soviet-made UAV,\" or unmanned aerial vehicles. This suggests Ukraine is not using the billions of dollars' worth of lethal aid it has received from the United States and other Western allies in attacks on Russian soil, which Washington has feared could trigger an escalation.",

Russian strikes also damaged a power supply line in the Sumy region. On the same day, the Ukrainian armed forces reported that air defenses shot down sixty of the more than seventy missiles launched by Russia. However, new data suggests that Russia is not striking Ukraine with the same intensity as it did at the beginning of the invasion. The United Kingdoms Defense Ministry reported on December 5 that the number of sorties conducted by Russian tactical combat aircraft over Ukraine had reduced significantly. \"Russian aircraft now probably conducts tens of missions per day, compared to a high of up to 300 per day in March 2022,\" it stated.\n\nThe Russian military continues to attack critical Ukrainian infrastructure, with reports of recent missile launches coming from the Caspian Sea. Moscow has previously used the Caspian Sea area to launch attacks on Ukraine. Russia will likely continue to use the Caspian region for future attacks as the possibility of Ukrainian attacks reaching critical Russian military infrastructure in occupied Crimea or Russia increases.\n\nSerhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Armed Forces Eastern Group, said that the frozen ground is enabling heavy vehicles to advance and that Ukrainian forces are preparing for winter operations. Last month, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Volodymyr Havrylov said that Ukraine would continue its offensive during the winter months because slowing down would allow Russian forces to replenish and bring in reinforcements.\n\nEarlier this week, several people were killed in explosions at two Russian military airfields. Russia accused Ukraine of using a drone to strike Russian targets hundreds of kilometers from the border at Engels Airport in the Saratov region and Dyagilevo Airbase in Ryazan. The Russian Defense Ministry stated that drone attacks had killed three people, adding that the drones were \"shot down as they flew in at low altitude,\" and the resulting explosions led to some superficial aircraft damage. The Kremlin-owned RIA Novosti news agency also reported a fuel explosion at an airfield outside Ryazan. According to the report, three people were killed and six injured in the incident, with one aircraft damaged. Visegrad 24 reported that the blast occurred at the Dyagilevo Airbase, which is also a strategic bomber base.\n\nElsewhere, surveillance footage showed a large explosion occurring at the Engels airbase at around 6am local time on December 5. The independent Russian Telegram channel Astra cited unidentified sources as saying a drone crashed into the airbase, damaging two long-range Tu-95 bombers and wounding two military personnel. Long-range Russian strategic bombers are believed to be based at this base in the Saratov region. Such bombers were previously used to launch attacks on Ukraines energy system. Saratov Governor Roman Busargin issued a statement calling for residents to remain calm amid the reports. While Ukraine says it has developed a drone that can fly more than 1,000 kilometers, we cannot confirm Ukraines involvement in the incident.\n\nMeanwhile, pro-Kremlin Telegram channels criticized Russian officials for failing to anticipate and prevent the drone strikes at the Engels and Dyagilevo airbases. Some Russian channels speculated that Ukraine launched the strike against Engels Airbase from inside Russian territory, asserting that Ukrainian sabotage groups are active inside Russia. One channel called on the Russian military to authorize retaliation strikes against Ukraine and intensify counterterrorism measures within Russia.\n\nRuslan Trad, Resident Fellow for Security Research, Sofia, Bulgaria\n\nSerbian group denies Wagner Group partnership despite announcement\n\nOn December 2, the Wagner Group said they are now present in Serbia, as they announced a collaboration with Orly, the \"Russian-Serbian Cultural and Information Center of Friendship and Cooperation.\" The announcement was widely reported by Serbian media on December 7. After receiving media attention, Orly published a statement the following day denying cooperation with Wagner. However, on December 6, Orly reshared the original announcement, published on the Wagner Telegram channel.\n\nThe Orly centers leader is Aleksander Lisov, who is banned from entering Kosovo. According to Wagners statement, one of the goals of the partnership is to \"deal with the information confrontation with Russian liberals\" who have gone to Serbia and are trying to \"carry out anti-Russian activities there with the aim of discrediting Russia.\"\n\nAccording to data from Serbias Interior Ministry, obtained by the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), nearly 45,000 Russian citizens have entered Serbia since February. The influx provoked both anti-Russian and anti-Ukrainian sentiments, however. Serbia also saw anti-war protests from Russians living in Belgrade, with some even burning their Russian passports.\n\nRussia is accelerating its presence in Serbia with the help of local groups, some of which are promoting their ties to Wagner. At the end of November, Damjan Kneevi, leader of the right-wing Peoples Patrol organization, boasted on Telegram about his visit to Wagners new center in Saint Petersburg. Kneevi recently said that connections to Wagner could help if there is a \"conflict in Kosovo.\"\n\nWagners potential development in Serbia remains a matter of speculation, as its presence has been limited to public statements. However, links between local Serbian groups and Wagner are expected to expand in the context of Kosovo tensions and the broader issue of the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Serbian government recently appointed a pro-Russian politician, Aleksandar Vulin, to be the director of BIA, Serbias intelligence agency.\n\nRuslan Trad, Resident Fellow for Security Research, Sofia, Bulgaria\n\nPro-Kremlin Telegram channels promote news of TV Rain losing broadcasting license in Latvia\n\nOn December 6, the Latvian National Electronic Media Council (NEPLP) revoked the broadcasting license of TV Rain (Dozhd), an independent Russian television channel, citing threats to Latvian national security. The decision was prompted by multiple instances of TV Rain not complying with Latvian law. Specifically, the channel did not provide Latvian translation; it broadcast a map of Russia that included Crimea on more than one occasion; and it referred to the Russian army as \"our army.\" Most recently, anchor Alexey Korostelev implied that the channel supported the Russian army. \"We hope that we were able to help many of the servicemen, including with equipment and even the most basic of conveniences at the frontline,\" he said. TV Rain denied any activity in support of the Russian army and fired Korostelev on December 2. The firing came after Edvins Snore, a Latvian politician, tweeted about Korostelevs call for Russian army support. The license cancelation can be appealed in the legal system.\n\nThe decision to cancel TV Rains license provoked many reactions. Many Latvian politicians, like Ivars Ijabs, a member of the European Parliament, supported the NEPLPs decision as it enforced Latvian law. However, the Latvian Journalists Association issued a statement calling the decision \"disproportionate.\" Other independent Russian media outlets like Meduza, also based in Latvia, created a petition supporting TV Rain.\n\nOn December 6, Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for Russias Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published a compilation on Telegram of statements by Western politicians condemning Russia for preventing TV Rains operations. She then suggested readers substitute the word \"Russia\" with \"Latvia.\"\n\nScreenshot of Google-translated text published by Maria Zakharova on Telegram. (Source: Maria Zakharova/archive)\n\nZakharovas statement garnered 613,536 views, 1,365 forwards, and 306 comments at the time of publishing, according to TGStat, a Telegram analysis tool. Out of 1,675 Telegram posts mentioning the keywords (TV Rain) and (\"will stop\") between November 30 and December 7, Zakharovas post received the highest number of views and forwards, according to TGStat.\n\nScatterplot graph shows engagement on Telegram channels, based on the average views and forwards, for posts about TV Rains license cancelation. (Source: @nikaaleksejeva/DFRLab via TGStat)\n\nTwenty-six pro-Kremlin Telegram channels amplified Zakharovas post. Some channels had a high subscriber count, like @SolovievLive, the channel of Vladimir Solovyov, which has 1.3 million followers. But other channels had few subscribers, like @yat_2020, a channel with two subscribers that amplifies pro-Kremlin content.

The governor said an oil storage tank had gone up in flames but there were no casualties.\n\nIt came a day after Russia confirmed it had been hit by what it said were Soviet-era drones at Engels air base, home to Russia's strategic bomber fleet, and in Ryazan, a few hours' drive from Moscow.\n\nThe attacks on Russian bases more than 500 kilometres from the border with Ukraine raised questions about the effectiveness of their air defences. They also threatened a major escalation of the nine-month war. One of the airfields houses bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons.\n\nUkrainian officials taunt Moscow\n\nUkrainian officials have not formally confirmed carrying out the drone attacks, maintaining their apparent policy of deliberate ambiguity as they have done in the past when it comes to high-profile attacks on Russian targets.\n\nBut presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak taunted Moscow in comments on Twitter.\n\n\"If something is launched into other countries' airspace, sooner or later unknown flying objects will return to the point of departure,\" Podolyak wrote. \"The Earth is round.\"\n\nA Ukrainian soldier takes a selfie with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, during his visit to Sloviansk, Ukraine, on Tuesday. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/The Associated Press)\n\nIn a daily intelligence update on the war in Ukraine, Britain's Defence Ministry said Russia was likely to consider the base attacks as \"some of the most strategically significant failures of force protection since its invasion of Ukraine.\" It said the bombers would likely be dispersed to other airfields.\n\nRussia's Defence Ministry said three service members were killed in the attack at Ryazan. Although the attacks struck military targets, it characterized them as terrorism and said the aim was to disable its long-range aircraft.\n\nRussian commentators on social media said that if Ukraine could strike that far inside Russia, it might also be able to hit Moscow.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at a news conference in Washington, said the United States has \"neither encouraged nor enabled the Ukrainians to strike inside of Russia.\"\n\nBut he said the U.S. is determined along with many other countries that back Kyiv to make sure that the Ukrainians have \"the equipment that they need to defend themselves, to defend their territory, to defend their freedom.\"\n\nIn this photo provided by the Zaporizhzhia region military administration, a damaged building and a car are seen after a Russian strike in the village of Novosofiivka, in the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine, on Monday. (Zaporizhzhia region military administration/The Associated Press)\n\nThe huge Tupolev long-range bombers that Russia stations at Engels are a major part of its strategic nuclear arsenal, similar to the B-52s deployed by the United States during the Cold War. Russia has used them in its campaign since October to destroy Ukraine's energy grid with near weekly waves of missile strikes.\n\nRussia responded to Monday's attacks with what it called a \"massive strike on Ukraine's military control system,\" though it did not identify any specific military targets for what Ukraine called Moscow's latest strikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nMissiles across Ukraine destroyed homes and knocked out power, but the impact seemed to be less severe than barrages last month that plunged millions of Ukrainians into darkness and cold.\n\nUkraine's air force said it had shot down more than 60 of around 70 missiles. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at least four people were killed.\n\nA missile tore a huge crater out of the earth in the village of Novosofiivka, about 25 kilometres east of Zaporizhzhia city in southern Ukraine, and completely shredded a nearby house.

(Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)\n\nOlha Troshyna, 62, said the dead were her neighbours who were standing by the car seeing off their son and daughter-in-law when the missile struck. With houses now destroyed and winter setting in, she had no idea where she would go.\n\n\"We have no place to go back to,\" she said. \"It would be fine if it were spring or summer. We could have done something if it were a warm season. But what am I going to do now?\"\n\n'Such missile strikes only increase our resistance'\n\nKyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's Defence Intelligence agency, said Moscow had enough missiles left for just a few more giant barrages before they were depleted.\n\nRussia claims a military justification for attacks on Ukraine's civil infrastructure. Kyiv says the strikes are intended to hurt civilians, a war crime.\n\n\"They do not understand one thing such missile strikes only increase our resistance,\" Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said.\n\nMarking Ukraine's armed forces day, Zelenskyy travelled to the eastern Donetsk region Tuesday and vowed to push Russian forces out of all of Ukraine's territory.\n\n\"Everyone sees your strength and your skill.... I'm grateful to your parents. They raised real heroes,\" Zelenskyy said in a video address to Ukrainian forces from the city of the Sloviansk, a key Ukrainian stronghold in the east.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian rocket attacks killed six people in the city of Donetsk, about 100 kilometres south of where Zelenskyy spoke, according to Denis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed Donetsk People's Republic separatists. He said one of those killed was a 29-year-old member of the DPR parliament, Maria Pirogova. The city is about 100 kilometres from where Zelenskyy visited.\n\nNo political talks are underway to end the war. Moscow insists it will not negotiate unless Kyiv and the West accept its sovereignty over Ukrainian lands it claims, while Kyiv says Russia must quit all its territory.\n\nExchange of POWs\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday talks would only be possible when Russia achieves the goals of its \"special military operation,\" which he did not define.\n\nHowever, the sides have discussed issues such as prisoner swaps.\n\nRussia and Ukraine said on Tuesday they had exchanged 60 prisoners of war on each side in the latest of a series of such swaps.\n\nRussia's Defence Ministry said the 60 freed Russian soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical care and psychological support.\n\nUkraine's presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak hailed the returning Ukrainians as heroes and said they included dozens who had held out in the city of Mariupol including the besieged Azovstal steelworks until Russia forced its surrender in May.\n\nThe two sides have exchanged hundreds of prisoners in a series of swaps over the past several months.",

Its origin has not yet been officially determined. But the Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti reported on its Telegram channel that the component was initially identified as part of an S-300 air defense missile by a Russian expert, who likened this situation to the deadly Nov. 15 incident in Poland. Thats when two people in the Polish town of Przewodw were killed after a missile - most likely fired by Ukrainian air defense - strayed over the border. You can read more about that in our coverage here.\n\nGiven that Russia launched another large-scale missile attack on Ukraine on Monday, it is quite possible that the component, apparently found undamaged, was fired by a Ukrainian air defense system in response to that attack.\n\nOliver Alexander, an open source intelligence researcher, identified it as the booster section of an S-300 air defense missile that likely fell to earth after a successful or failed interception of a Russian missile. Alexander told The War Zone he made his assessment based on comparing this image with pre-launched S-300 missile images.\n\n\"The fin attachment points and internal rudders for gas-dynamic control are visible,\" he said. \"Seeing as it landed as intact as it did, it seems that it fell to earth instead of crashing into the ground as part of the complete missile. After the warhead detonated, it just fell to earth.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry's claim that some of the missiles took circuitous routes, including to Ukraine's western region, lends credence to that Alexander's assessment.\n\nIn addition to the missile component landing on its territory, Moldova, which is linked to Ukraine's power grid, said its power supply was affected by the latest Russian missile wave.\n\n\"In connection with the massive attacks on Ukraine, Moldelectrica reports interruptions in the electricity system. Power outages are possible,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nUkrainian officials have yet to officially comment on the incident in Moldova, but the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said it shot down 60 of the 70 missiles fired by Russia today.\n\nThis is the latest incident where the war has spilled over the border.\n\nOn Oct. 31, Moldovan officials said a missile shot down by Ukrainian air defenses \"fell in the northern end of the town of Naslavcea in the Republic of Moldova, located on the border with Ukraine.\"\n\n\"At the moment, there are no registered victims,\" the statement added, \"but several windows of some houses in Naslavcea were broken.\"\n\nBefore heading into the rest of todays news from Ukraine, The War Zone readers can get caught up on our previous rolling coverage here.\n\nThe Latest\n\nThough two people were killed and three injured when a Russian missile hit Zaporizhzhia, the latest Russian barrage apparently caused comparatively little damage to the power infrastructure, according to Ukrainian media. Most of the problems seemed to be temporary.\n\n\"Partial or temporary blackouts were also reported in the Cherkassy, Vinnytsia, Kryvy Rih, Lviv, Ternopil and Mykolaiv regions, in some cases due to hits to the power grid and in others because of regional switch-offs to prevent grid overloads,\" the Kyiv Post said, citing local news reports. \"In Lviv Maksym Kozytsky, [the] head of the regional defense administration, issued a statement saying that social media reports of missile impacts in the region were simply wrong, although power service might be interrupted because of grid damage elsewhere.\"\n\nThe Russian military \"seemingly attempted to complicate Ukrainian air defense commands efforts to protect air space on Monday by launching attacks from multiple directions, including from ships in the Black Sea and from Tu-22M3 [Backfire] bombers over the Sea of Azov,\" the Kyiv Post reported. \"Some missiles reportedly took indirect flight paths via Ukraines central or western regions en route to targets further north. In the Kharkiv region, military authorities said Russian electronic warfare units attempted to jam Ukrainian air defense units.\"\n\nAccording to preliminary information, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry (MOD) said that 38 Kh-101/Kh-555 cruise missiles were launched from eight Tu-95ms Bear strategic aviation missile-carrying aircraft from the Caspian Sea and Volgodonsk regions of the Rostov region. Long-range Tu-22m3 Backfire bombers with three Kh-22 cruise missiles, as well as Su-35 Flanker fighters with six Kh-59 guided air missiles and one Kh-31P, attacked Ukraine from the Black Sea. Russia also fired 22 Kalibr cruise missiles from Black Sea Fleet ships.\n\n\"Anti-aircraft missile units, aviation, mobile fire groups of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other components of the Defense Forces were involved in repelling the air attack,\" the Ukrainian MOD said.\n\nUkraine, on the other hand, apparently inflicted damage on the Russian bases where some of those aircraft were launched.\n\nExplosions shook two different Russian airbases, Engels and Dyagilevo, earlier today. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) claimed that Ukraine used converted Soviet-era Tu-141 jet-powered unmanned aerial vehicles to prosecute the attacks, but that the drones were intercepted by Russian air defenses. Nevertheless, the attacks have caused some loss of life, and reportedly damaged one of the Backfires, although the extent of the material damage remains ambiguous for now. You can read more about that in our coverage here.\n\nWhile the Russians claim that Ukraine used old Tu-141 reconnaissance drones turned into improvised cruise missiles to attack the air bases, Ukraine says it is developing its own line of long-range attack drones capable of hitting targets 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) away.\n\nThe Ukrainian state defense firm Ukroboronprom conducted a number of successful tests of the Ukrainian strike drone with that range, said spokeswoman Nataliya Sad, according to Ukrinform.\n\n\"Today, a number of stages of successful tests are behind us,\" Sad said. \"In accordance with the instructions of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we are moving to the stage of tests under the effect of [electronic warfare] EW. After we successfully test the drone under the influence of EW, we hope to be able to test it in combat use. We promised by the end of this year, we are trying to fulfill this promise.\"\n\nOverall, the German-provided Gepard 1A2 self-propelled anti-aircraft gun systems have been a big boost to Ukrainian air defenses. Germany has promised Kyiv seven more. Berlin has now delivered 30 of the tracked Gepard vehicles, which sport a pair of 35mm automatic cannons mounted on a rotating turret that also features an integrated radar, according to the German governments ongoing tally of military and humanitarian aid it has sent to Ukraine. You can read more about that here and watch one in action in the video below.\n\nToday's attack took place on the 28th anniversary of the signing of the Budapest Memorandum by Russia, Ukraine, the U.S., and the U.K., in which Ukraine agreed to give up its stockpile of nuclear weapons left over from the collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as nuclear-capable aircraft and cruise missiles, in return for a guarantee of security.\n\nThe signatories agreed \"to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used.\"\n\nThe confluence of events was not lost on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"With todays missile attack Russia marked the anniversary of the Budapest Memorandum,\" Zelensky wrote on his Telegram channel. \"The fate of this document gives answers to many current questions about Russia. Simply signing something with these terrorists will not bring peace. They will certainly break any agreements reached with them. Giving up any element of someone elses security to Russia means new war.\"\n\n\"Therefore a principled continuation of the existing policy of conscientious states of the world is necessary: it is only the dismantling of Russian terrorist capacities, liberation of all our territories and holding the murderers to account that will bring peace.\"\n\n\"I believe we will come to this.\"\n\nOn the battlefield, very little territory has changed hands over the past 24 hours as Ukraine vows to continue staying on the offensive across the east and south during the winter with Russia largely on its heels. Russia, meanwhile, continues to press its attacks against Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut and elsewhere in the Donestk Oblast as well as around Svatove and Kreminna in the Luhansk Oblast.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War assessment:\n\nUkrainian officials have indicated that Ukrainian forces will continue counteroffensive operations over the upcoming winter.\n\nUkraines ability to maintain the military initiative depends on Ukrainian forces continuing counteroffensive operations in the winter of 2022-2023.\n\nRussian sources reported that Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the directions of Kreminna and Svatove.\n\nRussian forces continued to conduct offensive operations around Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nGroups of mobilized Russian soldiers continue to disrupt Russian force generation efforts with refusals to fight, as well as insubordination and defiance.\n\nRussian forces likely publicly executed residents in occupied Luhansk Oblast on accusations of partisan activity.\n\nThough Russia isn't having much success on the battlefield, Moscow mouthpieces are crowing about Russian President Vladimir Putin's drive across the Kerch Bridge, his prized, $4 billion span linking the mainland and the occupied Crimean peninsula. That bridge, you will recall, is still being repaired after being badly damaged Oct. 8.\n\nAs Russia celebrates Putin's drive, his mobilized reservists are apparently still suffering, with scores reportedly held without food or water in a children's camp.\n\nThose who aren't being held get to march around in the snow.\n\nBut at least they aren't having ordnance dropped on them by Ukrainian drones and artillery, like these troops apparently are.\n\nOr destroyed, along with their equipment, in a convoy, like these troops.\n\nFinally, even while its troops are dying and getting wounded and its people are suffering after more than nine months of war, Ukraine continues to maintain a sense of humor.\n\nThe Ukrainian MOD this morning shared a video of one of its troops doing the Pikachu dance.\n\nIt was apparently inspired by the famously annoying pointy-eared yellow Pokemon creature.\n\nThat's it for now.\n\nWe will update this story if there is anything major to add until our next new update is posted.",

                "cc_text": "Whats new? Western governments backing Kyiv in the Russo-Ukrainian war must wrestle with four persistent questions: what is the risk Russia will use nuclear weapons? Can diplomacy at this stage help end the war? Would a ceasefire right now be welcome? Could a change in Russias government bring peace? Why did it happen? After its massive assault on Ukraine, Moscow has stumbled in the face of unexpectedly successful resistance, but it fights on. It has claimed to annex new Ukrainian territories, drafted hundreds of thousands, rhetorically brandished nuclear weapons and attacked energy infrastructure. Still, enabled by Western support, Kyiv has the upper hand. Why does it matter? Western powers see Russias efforts to conquer territory and achieve other goals through aggression and nuclear menacing as threatening their interests as well as Ukraines. They believe the dangers of accepting Russian aggression outweigh the hazards of continued conflict including the low but non-negligible risk of nuclear use. What should be done? The West should continue backing Ukraine while keeping NATO outside the conflict. Pushing for talks or a ceasefire before the parties are ready to compromise would be fruitless. Ultimately, Russia and the West should negotiate new security arrangements, but at present diplomacy will be most helpful in managing the wars repercussions.\n\nI. Overview\n\nIn late February, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, transforming a simmering eight-year conflict into a hot war that has forced millions of Ukrainians from their homes and upended Europes security order. Confounding expectations, and reinforced by military and economic support from Western powers, Ukraines resistance has forced the Kremlin to revisit its goals. As Russian forces struggle, Moscow has proclaimed annexation of new territories; mobilised hundreds of thousands more troops; launched massive attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure; and reminded the world of its nuclear weapons capacity. Thus far, however, little suggests it can turn the tide. Western policymakers wrestle with tough questions about the costs and risks of supporting Ukraine. But the fundamentals remain unchanged: for all the horrors of continued war, Russian subjugation of Ukraine would be more perilous for global peace and security. NATO capitals should maintain support for Kyiv, avoid direct conflict with Moscow and convey to the Kremlin the benefits a settlement acceptable to Ukraine would bring. Nine months after Russias 24 February assault, near-term prospects for peace are gloomy. Both Ukraine and Russia insist that peace will come only if the other party concedes. Kyiv, understandably, wants Russian forces to leave all of Ukraine, including Crimea and territory held by Moscows proxies in the eastern Donbas region since 2014 and 2015. It also wants the Kremlin to drop its unilateral claim to having annexed Ukrainian land. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated that he finds the Kremlin an impossible counterpart and signed a decree ruling out negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, although he has since stated that Kyiv is open to negotiations on Ukraines terms. Moscows position has become harder to read of late, though realistically it holds out little hope for a settlement any time soon. Russian officials say they are willing to negotiate. But they reject Ukraines terms, and offer neither concessions nor explicit proposals, as they fire barrages of missiles at Ukrainian power plants. Ukrainians across the country are facing chronic electricity and water outages as a result. Militarily, Kyiv has the upper hand, but not yet a guaranteed victory, much less a rapid one. It has made territorial gains in the east, during a September counteroffensive, and in the south, including the November liberation of Kherson, the regional capital held by Russian troops since early March. It has also flexed its muscles with long-range attacks on Crimea and Russia proper including early December strikes on the Engels and Dyagilevo air bases, hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border that revealed gaps in Russian reconnaissance and air defences. But Kyivs capacity to wage war hinges upon a steady supply of ammunition and weaponry from the West, whose support remains steadfast, though some in Western capitals do perhaps have an eye on costs and dwindling stocks. Ukraine still struggles at times to ensure that all forces are adequately equipped, with territorial defence and national guard units most often reporting shortages, including of winter gear. At the same time, little suggests Russia can prevail. The Kremlin reacted to Ukraines rebound by mobilising some 300,000 men into the army, most with seemingly scant preparation. Comparable numbers, at least, have fled the country for fear of being conscripted. Moscow has also launched a blitz of Ukraines energy infrastructure, aimed at weakening its morale as winter deepens. In early December, President Putin appeared to recognise that Russia was in for a long struggle.\n\nMost troubling are Moscows consistent reminders to Kyiv and the West of the risks of escalation.\n\nMany of Russias other moves seem geared to unsettle. It deployed several thousand soldiers and substantial gear to Belarus, whence Russia launched offensives into Ukraine in February. Moscow could perhaps attack again from there, but its combat-ready troop strength (about 30,000, when added to that of Belarus) is matched by Ukraines deployments on the other side. Most troubling are Moscows consistent reminders to Kyiv and the West of the risks of escalation, invoking its own nuclear capabilities, accusing Ukraine of planning to use a \"dirty bomb\" and raising worries about a false flag operation. In late October, President Putin appeared to walk some of those threats back, though in early December, he warned the risk of nuclear war was rising, while suggesting that Russia was all too cognisant of the danger. The upshot is that the battlefield remains bitterly contested. The Kremlin appears to be banking on its partial mobilisation to contain further Ukrainian offensives as winter cold, soggy weather and mud complicate operations for both sides. Having lost Kherson, Moscow may expect Ukraine to try cutting off the land bridge of captured Ukrainian territory that connects Russian-held areas of Donbas and Russia proper to the annexed peninsula of Crimea. By moving its most capable forces east of the Dnipro river, it looks to be digging in though some of those units have reportedly gone to Donetsk to fortify Russias forces there.If, as fighting continues, Russias troops have trouble holding the line, Moscow could decide to escalate further, with another draft, even wider attacks on civilian infrastructure or, possibly, at a last gasp though the risk remains low a nuclear strike. Alternatively, it could change its approach to negotiations. Against this backdrop, this briefing addresses four questions at the centre of policy debates in Western capitals. It focuses on the risk of nuclear escalation; the role diplomacy can play at this stage of the conflict; the possible utility of a ceasefire pending broader peace talks; and prospects that a change of government in Moscow might ease the path to peace. The answers, while hardly comforting, should shape Western policy: The risk of nuclear war, while still low, is real enough and must be carefully managed. Still, it is not a persuasive argument for allowing Russia to achieve its objectives through aggression and nuclear menacing. As things stand, the precedent created by making major concessions to Russia would be more dangerous than continuing war. The risk of nuclear confrontation would, however, spike dramatically if NATO were to enter the conflict directly. Both sides need to take care to avoid this outcome.\n\nCalls for diplomacy to end the war need to be tethered to reality. The West, and Washington in particular, should keep the door open to talks. They should continue to make sure that Kyiv does not set impossible preconditions; avoid regime change rhetoric that would deter Kremlin engagement; and signal that a reasonable peace will lead to sanctions relief. Both Kyiv and the West should continue to look for areas where cooperation can blunt the wars effects for example, prisoner exchanges, efforts to sustain and extend the deal that provides safe passage for Ukrainian grain across the Black Sea, and arrangements to manage nuclear safety risks at Ukraines Zaporizhzhia power plant. But calling for peace talks when both parties see more to gain on the battlefield, and neither is ready to compromise, is almost certain to be fruitless.\n\nFor similar reasons, a ceasefire is not on the cards right now. With both parties still believing they can fight their way to a better position, each would demand ceasefire terms the other sees as untenable.\n\nThe likelihood that a new guard comes to power in Russia and brings the conflict to an end is low. The Russian state is too powerful, the opposition too weak and avenues for pressure on the Kremlin too scant for this prospect to be anything on which to base planning. Certainly, trying to force change from the outside would be counterproductive and dangerous. For as long as these fundamentals hold, Western governments should keep providing Ukraine with what it needs to repel Russias invasion. The war is exacting a terrible toll on Ukraine and wreaking havoc on the global economy and, to some degree, world affairs. But NATO powers have judged that to support the grinding fighting in Ukraine, and even bear a small risk of nuclear escalation, is a better choice for them and for the world than clearing the way for Russia to prevail through a brutal military campaign and nuclear menacing. Their calculation is that these costs and risks are the necessary price of preserving Ukraines sovereignty as well as international peace and security. That calculation is a tough one to make: to some degree, it unsettles other parts of the world. It certainly requires continuous revisiting. At some point, the logic may change, pursuant to events on Ukraines battlefields and in Russia itself. For now, though, it is the right approach.\n\nII. How Likely is Nuclear War?\n\nFor all the suffering the Ukraine war has brought, the most terrifying prospect, at least for audiences far from the front, is that Russia uses nuclear weapons, triggering a confrontation with NATO. At the extremes of discourse about this possibility in the West are two arguments: one that Western backing for Ukraine has set the world on an escalatory spiral that will all too likely end in nuclear war; the other that the West should offer greater support, because Russia is bluffing, has no intention of going nuclear and will back down in the face of Western resolve. While the Kremlins calculations are opaque, making it impossible to know for sure, the best assessment almost certainly lies between these extremes. Nuclear war remains unlikely because both NATO states and Russia fear it. But it is not out of the question that, if all else fails, the Kremlin might gamble on a nuclear strike. The best course is thus neither to end Western backing in essence, caving in to nuclear blackmail nor to dramatically increase it. Western capitals should, in other words, prudently manage the escalatory risk inherent in their support for Ukraine.\n\nA. Playing the Nuclear Card\n\nThe primary reason that the nuclear threat has been so central to media and analytic coverage of the war is that the Kremlin has made it so. Russia ushered in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine with a reminder to Kyiv and the West of its nuclear arsenal and the possibility that it might use a weapon. On the day of the invasion, Putin warned Western states of \"consequences such as you have never seen\" if they were to \"stand in our way\". Moscows nuclear signalling grew even more unnerving in September. Putin wove comments about nuclear weapons, and Russias willingness to defend its \"territorial integrity\" with \"all the systems available to us\" through his announcements of mobilisation and plans to annex some or all of four Ukrainian regions partially occupied by Russian forces. The seeming intimation was that Moscow was threatening to use nuclear weapons in response to Ukraines efforts to liberate its own territory, now claimed by Russia. Shortly thereafter, in October, top Russian officials introduced a new angle to the narrative of nuclear peril by sharing what seemed like an entirely concocted set of concerns about Ukraine. They relayed to the UN Security Council and the defence ministers of the U.S., Trkiye, the UK, India, China and France that Moscow believed Ukraine planned to use a \"dirty bomb\" on its own territory. Russias interlocutors dismissed these claims prima facie, as there is no evidence of Ukraine having the capacity, much less the will, to do anything of the sort. But Moscows allegations did raise fears that it might be laying the groundwork for nuclear use against Ukraine, in retaliation for a false flag action.\n\nRussia would resort to nuclear use only in accordance with its military doctrine \"to protect its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and to ensure the safety of the Russian people\".\n\nBy the end of that same month, Putin seemed to walk back some of Russias threats and posturing. Speaking at the Valdai discussion club, he indicated that his past comments about nuclear use had been intended to unnerve, and said he saw no reason, as yet, for anyone to use nuclear weapons. He also said that Russia would resort to nuclear use only in accordance with its military doctrine \"to protect its sovereignty [and] territorial integrity, and to ensure the safety of the Russian people\". Putins statements went only so far in reassuring, however, in part because they could be taken as a departure from the very nuclear doctrine he cited. The countrys 2010 and 2014 published doctrines state that Russia would use nuclear weapons \"in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies\" or in the event of conventional aggression if \"the very existence of the state is in jeopardy\". Its most recent military doctrine, issued as a joint, \"union government\" doctrine with Belarus, offers no conditions for nuclear use, but states that Russian nuclear weapons \"will remain an important factor for preventing\" both nuclear and conventional conflicts. Other doctrinal documents spell out conditions of use that include threats to Russias nuclear deterrent forces, but also speak of using nuclear threats for deterrence ie, to convince adversaries to back down. Putins Valdai speech deviated from these formulas, although in some cases one could imagine that the Kremlin might view threats to territorial integrity as tantamount to threats to \"the very existence of the state\". On 7 December, President Putin returned to the nuclear theme. In widely publicised remarks to Russias Presidential Human Rights Council, Putin warned that the risk of nuclear war was rising and said he viewed Russias nuclear arsenal as primarily deterrent, even if remaining somewhat evasive on his precise nuclear policy, and also noted that \"Russia has not gone crazy\". In other words, his goal was seemingly to convince the world that Moscow was not the one threatening nuclear war while again reminding his foes about Russias nuclear weapons.\n\nB. Global Reactions\n\nWestern states have responded to Russias comments with their own deterrent rhetoric, although the pitch has varied. After Putins 24 February comments, Frances foreign minister noted that the Russian president \"must also understand that the Atlantic alliance is a nuclear alliance\". Elizabeth Truss, the United Kingdoms prime minister from 6 September to 25 October, said when campaigning for the role that she was willing and \"ready\" to use nuclear weapons if needed, though she did not explicitly invoke the war in Ukraine. (Putin subsequently referred to her remarks explicitly in his as evidence that he was not the one brandishing nuclear weapons). The U.S., meanwhile, says nuclear use by Russia would lead to \"catastrophic\" consequences, the specifics of which, according to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the White House has directly communicated to Moscow. Washington has been publicly circumspect about whether and under what circumstances the U.S. would answer with force placing it in direct conflict with Russia, with all the attendant risks or turn to a range of other measures that might include cyber operations, economic responses and delivery of heavier weaponry to Ukraine. Russias partners in Asia have also urged Moscow to exercise restraint. Perhaps most importantly, China called on international actors to prevent a nuclear crisis on the continent. According to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, \"the international community should jointly oppose the use or threats to use nuclear weapons, advocate that nuclear weapons must not be used and nuclear wars must not be fought, in order to prevent a nuclear crisis in Eurasia\". India stated clearly that nuclear weapons should not be used by any side in the Russo-Ukrainian war. Despite the generally wide variance in views around the table, the G20 took a strong line on this issue in its declaration at Novembers summit in Indonesia: \"The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible\".\n\nC. Assessing the Risk\n\nDespite the disastrous consequences the use of nuclear weapons would incur including for Russia itself Moscow might, if unhindered by formal doctrine, see several rationales for a nuclear strike. Some Russian officials reportedly believe, despite all the Wests warnings, that Ukraine and its Western backers would back away from further escalation in the face of Russian nuclear use. If the leadership follows this logic, Russia might consider using nuclear weapons, especially if it senses that defeat on the battlefield is looming and, with it, the chance of domestic upheaval. Hyperbolic as it may sound, Putins propagandists often suggest that Armageddon is worth risking in service to a global mission of Russian greatness. The Kremlin might also judge, particularly in the face of major military setbacks, that it needs to make good on its threats, for the sake of credibility and absent other options. Moscow might also believe it can convince enough people that it is responding to a radiological threat from Ukraine and thus escape global opprobrium. The risk of Russian nuclear use would become far more acute were NATO to confront Russia directly. Most Western capitals appear to understand this danger all too well, given their caution in avoiding steps that edge too close to escalation, including their rejection of a no-fly zone after Russias all-out invasion and their measured response to reports of a missile strike in Poland on 15 November. If Russia were directly at war with NATO, it could conclude that the states very existence was threatened, which is the central scenario for use of nuclear weapons that its doctrine contemplates. Such a war might not immediately threaten core state functions (eg, an attack on the seat of government in Moscow) or Russias nuclear deterrent and capacity to retaliate. But because Moscow probably expects that in any such war, NATO would seek to limit Russian nuclear capabilities, the Kremlin might see these capabilities to be at risk in a range of situations that are difficult to anticipate. It might then launch pre-emptive nuclear attacks to demonstrate resolve or to use its weapons before a U.S. counterforce strike decimates them.\n\nA nuclear strike would not help Russia attain its goals.\n\nFor now, though, it seems highly unlikely that Moscow would gamble on a nuclear strike. Even leaving aside the international outrage, including in non-Western capitals, that doing so would provoke, there are strong practical reasons to eschew such tactics. Put simply, a nuclear strike would not help Russia attain its goals. Indeed, nuclear use would serve no tactical military purpose. While the fear, destruction and mayhem that even a \"smaller\" weapon (ie, one roughly half the size of the bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki) could wreak would be enormous, no crucial bridge can be destroyed, or road rendered impassable, only by using a nuclear weapon. Conventional explosives can be used to the same effect without the enormous risks to Russia itself that would be associated with nuclear use. Even beyond the likelihood of provoking a Western response, these risks include the possibilities that radiation blows into Russia, harming people there, or drifts into Europe, forcing an even greater escalation than might otherwise be the case. Consistent with this logic, Moscow has stayed strictly conventional over the nine months of war, despite its travails on the battlefield and despite attacks on Russian territory as well as on Ukrainian lands that Russia claims as its own, large swathes of which Ukraine has now liberated. Western officials are reportedly aware that Russian authorities have considered their nuclear options, but also say they have seen no evidence that Moscow has prepared or is preparing to use nuclear weapons. Moreover, militaries generally consider all sorts of options in the midst of war planning, so it is difficult to know whether the reported discussions were significant. Meanwhile, the Kremlins increased tempo of strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure horrific in their own right and conscription of hundreds of thousands of men suggest that it plans to keep its escalation conventional, at least for now. Perhaps the strongest argument that the risk of Russian nuclear use remains low is that Russia appears to be counting on its sabre rattling in part to deter direct conflict with the West. Russian behaviour thus far pairs nuclear menacing with the reality that, even as weapons for Ukraine are delivered from NATO territories, Moscow has not struck any targets outside Ukraine. Despite its rhetoric, Moscow, like its NATO counterparts, has thus far steered clear of actions that could draw alliance members directly into the war and trigger a wider, even global conflagration. Its actions suggest that it, like NATO capitals, hopes to avoid direct NATO-Russia confrontation, seeing the dangers such conflict would bring. It might seem something of a paradox that Moscow, in attempting to keep NATO out of the war, is threatening to do precisely the thing that would run the gravest risk of NATO getting more directly involved. Nonetheless, the Kremlin appears to see deterrent value in such threats.\n\nD. Nuclear Menacing and Its Audiences\n\nDeterrence is likely not the only purpose behind Russias nuclear menacing. As with its large-scale bombing of Ukrainian energy and civilian infrastructure, Moscow also appears to hope that it might frighten Ukrainians into abandoning resistance and the West into stopping support for Kyiv. In that sense, the tactic has played differently to different audiences. For Ukraine, which understandably sees the present conflict as existential, regardless of whether it is fought by conventional or nuclear means, the threats are largely ineffective and have perhaps even lost punch over time. For Kyivs Western backers, they are more salient. Violating the nuclear taboo after 75-plus years would be a seismic shock to global security, even before one considers the immediate humanitarian consequences, the possibility of radioactive fallout in Europe and the risks of catastrophic escalation that it could portend. Western officials, for the first time in decades, have had to seriously grapple with the question of how they would respond to a nuclear strike by Moscow. But even in the West, Moscows threats appear to be backfiring. While the nuclear menacing has likely strengthened the voices of those urging caution about direct intervention in the conflict, it has not bolstered arguments for ratcheting back support and, in some respects, has undermined them. At least among policymakers, Russias use of nuclear threats raises the stakes for backing down. They worry that any apparent weakening of support for Ukraine would smack of giving in to nuclear blackmail, which could embolden Moscow into believing that it can throw its weight around in a similar way beyond Ukraine. Some European officials now argue that, due in large part to the Kremlins nuclear threats, the war is existential not just for Ukraine, but also for their countries, which could be threatened in the future. This logic has its limits. Russia does not necessarily have the same designs on other states that it has on Ukraine. Plus, even if Moscows threats fail in Ukraine, it may still try the tactic again, there or elsewhere. Still, if it succeeds in Ukraine, the odds of more such menacing are surely higher.\n\nWestern governments are right to maintain support for Ukraine, while simultaneously steering clear of long-understood thresholds.\n\nBroadly speaking, then, Western governments are right to maintain support for Ukraine, while simultaneously steering clear of long-understood thresholds such as direct NATO involvement in the conflict and deterring Russia from nuclear use. The White House, although making clear that it has communicated to Russia how it would respond to a nuclear strike, remains tight-lipped about those plans, at least in public. But it may well have conveyed that nuclear use would have precisely the consequences that both sides have sought to avoid, pulling NATO into a confrontation that, even if conventional at first, would run a grave risk of going nuclear. Western leaders should also continue to encourage statements, like the G20 leaders declaration in Indonesia and those of China and India, in which non-Western countries make clear their opposition to nuclear weapons use.\n\nIII. Can Diplomacy End the War, and If So, How?\n\nNotwithstanding the bitterness the war has engendered, diplomacy among Russia, Ukraine and others has continued. In the build-up to the 24 February invasion, Western powers undertook a flurry of diplomatic efforts aimed at convincing Russia to sit down with its neighbours to negotiate a European security order that could better serve everyones interests. They also sought to reassure the Kremlin that they had no intention of admitting Ukraine to the NATO alliance, something that, despite not being on the cards prior to Russias invasion, Moscow had long described as a threat to its security. The efforts failed. Russias demands, which included a return to the pre-enlargement NATO force posture of the 1990s, were maximalist and unrealistic, but if they had been a starting negotiating position, talks could have ensued. Instead, rather than coming to the negotiating table, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Soon after the invasion, Ukraine entered into negotiations with its adversary. At first, Moscow demanded capitulation from Kyiv, which the Ukrainian government rejected. As Russias military was forced to withdraw from Ukraines north and centre, however, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators (peculiarly, especially in light of the growing role of women in Ukraines government and military, seemingly all-male on both sides) began to make progress. In particular, they agreed on specific parameters for Ukraines future neutrality an end state desired by Moscow and that Kyiv, at that point, was prepared to live with. But talks soon stalled. Moscow wanted Ukraine to withdraw forces from the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk which Russia recognised as independent states within their Ukrainian administrative boundaries on 21 February, even before it made additional military inroads into those territories and did not want to discuss the status of Crimea. Ukraine wanted Moscow to return to its positions of 23 February, as well as to postpone bilateral talks on the status of Crimea for fifteen years. The negotiations ground to a halt in late March, when atrocities, including summary executions, rapes and other torture, committed by Russian forces in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, came to light.\n\nTalks have continued ... seeking to address the wars consequences.\n\nOther talks have continued, however not concerning the core of a political settlement but seeking to address the wars consequences. Moscow and Kyiv make regular direct deals to exchange prisoners and remains of the dead. Other parties have helped facilitate some efforts notably, Saudi Arabia was a stopping point for Ukrainian prisoners of war returned from Russia, and it assisted, as did Trkiye, with repatriation of foreign nationals fighting for Ukraine who had been in Russian custody. A 22 July deal, brokered by Trkiye and the UN, to restart Ukrainian grain exports across the Black Sea, which provides a lifeline for Ukrainian farmers and global consumers and has helped facilitate Russian agricultural exports, nearly broke down in October, but quickly got back on track. It has now been extended for another 120 days starting on 18 November. Through its own diligent negotiations with both Moscow and Kyiv, the UNs nuclear watchdog agency has obtained access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to help ascertain the safety of the facility, where Russia holds the Ukrainian staff hostage and has established a military base. This record demonstrates the power of diplomacy to mitigate the damage of war, and even to end it, but also the need to ensure that expectations for what it can accomplish are realistic. Experience to date offers no reason to think that if the right formula, or the right mediator, is found, the conflict might end. To the contrary, as the discussion above shows, a wide variety of mediators have been engaged already. They have been valuable in mitigating the conflicts effects, and they, and many others, stand ready to help when peace talks become possible. But, no matter who the mediator, meaningful peace talks can take place only when Russia, Ukraine or both are prepared to compromise. Thus far, neither is. Kyiv is in no mood to offer concessions because it has continued to improve its battlefield position, in defiance of expectations of how it would fare. On 24 February, most analysts predicted that Russia would win a quick military victory in Ukraine. Some argued that Ukraine would resist, and that Russia would face an ugly fight, but these observers, too, judged Moscows military capability to be decisively superior to Kyivs. In practice, Russia proved to be far less capable than assessed, and Ukraine, backed by Western military and economic aid, has had Russia on the back foot for some time, disrupting first its plan of rapid conquest that would force regime change and then its effort to gain full control of Donbas. Moreover, after eight months of war, Russia is in even worse shape militarily than earlier on, having suffered heavy losses of equipment and personnel, including in its best-trained and most combat-ready units, and is now relying on weapons purchased from Iran. Some estimates hold that as much as half of the force that attacked on 24 February is dead, incapacitated or off the battlefield for other reasons. Ukraines long-range attacks on high value targets in Crimea and deep within Russia proper, including early December strikes on the Engels and Dyagilevo air bases (which host strategic bombers hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border), reveal gaps in Moscows reconnaissance and air defence.\n\nKyiv is confident that it is on a path to liberate ever more of its land.\n\nNow, the Ukrainian army, having taken Kherson city and made inroads in Luhansk region, is also spoiling Russias third war plan to gain and retain control of those territories that Moscow had declared annexed, even though it is only Luhansk that Russia ever had full control of (and that temporarily). Indeed, Kyiv is confident that it is on a path to liberate ever more of its land, especially since Russian troops have left Kherson, the only regional capital that they had been able to capture since February. Although winter weather and better-established Russian defensive positions may slow progress, Ukraine has little reason to expect major reversals. Even if his government wanted to cut a deal, Zelenskyy would struggle to find the political space to do it. He must answer to public opinion that is overwhelmingly opposed to any compromise with the Kremlin. September polling indicated that 70 per cent of Ukrainians wanted to keep fighting until victory, and over 90 per cent define victory as regaining all territory held by Russia, including Crimea. As more territory is liberated, reports of the suffering, including gender-based violence, that civilians are enduring under Russian occupation surely feed Ukrainians desire to regain control of their land. Moreover, although Ukraines elites are united behind the Zelenskyy administration, the countrys dynamic political scene has not disappeared, and opposition leaders would rapidly take action in the face of what they would see as appeasement of Russia. Kyivs leadership would likely not survive in power, and any deal it struck might prove less than durable, if it made fundamental concessions to Russia at this time. Russia, although complaining about Ukrainian unwillingness to negotiate, also is not in the market for compromise. Rather, Moscow appears to want only deals that cement its gains and, ideally, more: that is, to maintain its position in the south and east, if not take full control of all four territories that it claims to have annexed. For now, Moscow appears to calculate that devastating attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and reminders to Western states of the risks of escalation will combine with rising energy costs across Europe to shift dynamics in its favour. It may hope that the slim majority the Republican Party now enjoys in the U.S. House of Representatives, and particularly its faction that opposes aid to Ukraine, will erode political support for U.S. assistance. It no doubt expects erroneously but probably genuinely that if it can convince Ukraines Western backers to rethink their support, then Kyivs own calculus about staying in the war will change. Indeed, many in the Kremlin appear to still believe that Western states are forcing Ukraine to fight, even after months of evidence of Ukrainian agency. As for Kyivs Western backers, they have thus far judged that acceding to Russian coercion, and in particular nuclear menacing, would be fundamentally counterproductive to their own security interests. Of course, Western states are not a monolith, and debates continue, as exemplified by comments in November by U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley suggesting that Ukraine should seek negotiations to solidify its gains. But Milleys remarks were quickly countered by his civilian bosses. The prevailing consensus in Western capitals is that if they press Ukraine to negotiate, Russia will think they are driven by desire to end the war, even at great cost. Moscow might then not only seize the moment to press for recognition of its territorial claims, but also, as discussed above, be emboldened to more adventurism, in Ukraine and elsewhere. By way of background, on 11 November, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia was ready to negotiate with Ukraine without preconditions. On 14 November, Russias Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko clarified that Kyivs demand to withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory was unacceptable to Moscow as a precondition to starting negotiations. On 15 November, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said it was Ukraine that refused to negotiate, not Russia. On 1 December, Lavrov said Russia had never asked for negotiations but was ready to listen to proposals for talks. See \"MFA says ready for dialogue with Kyiv without preconditions\", RBC, 11 November 2022; \"The Russian foreign ministry found unacceptable the condition for the withdrawal of troops to start negotiations\", Radio Liberty, 14 November 2022; \"Ukraine refuses to negotiate, not Russia: What Lavrov said at the G20\", TASS, 15 November 2022; and \"Lavrov says Russia never asked for talks on Ukraine\", Interfax, 1 December 2022.\n\nEven if shifts in domestic politics or economic pressure were to bring about a change of heart in Western capitals ... the violence in Ukraine would not necessarily end.\n\nBesides, a withdrawal of Western support from Ukraine would hardly signal the end of the crisis. Even if shifts in domestic politics or economic pressure were to bring about a change of heart in Western capitals, which right now seems unlikely, the violence in Ukraine would not necessarily end. Nor would the region necessarily experience greater stability. While a Western about-face would greatly damage Ukraines war effort, and it might even change Kyivs cost-benefit calculations concerning negotiations, it would probably not make Ukrainian public opinion more conciliatory especially since, at this point, the Russian missile barrages do not seem to be weakening resolve. (An October survey found that 86 per cent of Ukrainians agree that their country should fight on in the face of bombardment.) There could also be other dangers to reducing support to Ukraine. Even if some Western states back away, others (particularly on Europes eastern flank) would strongly resist doing so, leading to discord within the European Union and the NATO alliance. If Russia subsequently were to act aggressively, in Ukraine or elsewhere, generating a new crisis, the states that had scaled down their assistance would be under tremendous pressure to show greater resolve the second time around likely creating even graver risks of escalation than those present today. Against this backdrop, the Western, and in particular U.S., approach to diplomacy is sensibly focused on risk mitigation and keeping options open. The White House has maintained a diplomatic channel between U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Kremlin counterparts Nikolai Patrushev (President Putins national security adviser) and Yuri Ushakov (his top foreign policy aide) to help both sides manage the risk of escalation. CIA Director William Burns met with the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergey Naryshkin, in Trkiye. At the same time, the U.S. has reportedly pressed Kyiv to stop insisting that the Putin government be removed from power as a precondition to peace talks. In so doing, Washington has signalled its discomfort with a posture that in effect makes peace talks impossible, while avoiding the suggestion that the time is ripe for such talks. So, under what circumstances might meaningful talks be feasible? Perhaps the most promising scenario a low-odds one but not completely implausible would see Russias demands change. If Ukraines battlefield success continues, Russia would have two options. One would be to escalate further, with more attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, additional mobilisations, more threats and (however unlikely) nuclear weapon use. The other would be to seek a ceasefire or peace talks. At least some interlocutors close to the Kremlin recognise that Russias resources are increasingly exhausted; that coercion and threats are not working; and that Russian forces appear unlikely to regain the upper hand on the battlefield. \"There is an understanding in the Kremlin that mobilisation will not enable a decisive victory over Ukraine\", a Russian expert close to the Kremlin told Crisis Group. If these views hold sway and the Kremlin leadership offers compromise of some sort (with details depending on battlefield dynamics), Western pressure on Ukraine to negotiate would rise. Ukraines government would also likely be more amenable, although domestic political dynamics would continue to limit what it could negotiate about. In the meantime, Western governments, while supporting Ukraine, can keep a door open to diplomacy aimed at ending the war, even if the moment now is not opportune. They should do all they can to help the Kremlin feel it can back away from the war without risking that its adversaries will try to foment its domestic collapse. They cannot, of course, guarantee Russias stability but they can try to make eventual deals with Ukraine more palatable, including, as Crisis Group has previously recommended, by dangling the prospect of easing the sanctions that have inflicted the most pain on ordinary Russians and reiterating that any peace deal would also require new security arrangements for the region as a whole, to reassure everyone, including Ukraine and Russia. To this end, recent statements by U.S. President Joe Biden, that he is prepared to speak with Putin if the latter sought to end the war, and French President Emmanuel Macron, that he would keep engaging with the Kremlin to mitigate wars effects, hit the right notes.\n\nIV. Could a Ceasefire Be a Positive Step?\n\nCalls for negotiations aimed at reaching agreement on a ceasefire abound in some corners of social media. But as with a broader deal, both Russia and Ukraine insist that an end to fighting is possible only if and when the other accedes to its demands ie, Ukraine withdraws from the territories Russia claims to have annexed (in Moscows case) or Russia withdraws from Ukraine (in Kyivs). Neither scenario is in the offing right now. At some point, if Russia continues to lose ground, it may be more interested in a ceasefire based on the battle lines then in place, but even that would not necessarily make such a deal a precursor to peace. From Moscows perspective, the point of a ceasefire would almost certainly be to buy time and space to rebuild its military capacity in preparation for new offensives and to pressure Ukraine for concessions in the meantime. While Ukraine would just as surely use the time the same way, it has little interest in quitting while it is ahead and giving Russia time to catch up. Furthermore, unless Russia is greatly weakened, it would likely demand ceasefire terms that include, at the least, recognition of its control of the territory it occupied at that time and limits on Ukrainian military activity and deployments. A Russian military expert told Crisis Group: \"The Kremlin wants to retain at least some of the territories it has annexed, and any ceasefire that guarantees this is now in Russias interest\". Accepting those terms would make no sense to Kyiv unless it, too, is facing real constraints on its fighting capacity. Again, as with a broader deal, Moscow may be counting on Western pressure to shift dynamics. But here as well, Kyiv would resist any such pressure. Western states, too, view the idea of seeking a ceasefire now as tantamount to giving in to Russias nuclear blackmail and setting the stage for more of the same an assessment that seems valid based on Russias behaviour to date. At a later point, it is not unthinkable that a ceasefire could pave the way to a broader deal. For now, though, even if new stalemates in the fighting are possible, there is little reason for either side to want to formalise them. Even were Western capitals inclined to push Kyiv toward a ceasefire and Ukraine less impervious to pressure, it is hard to imagine much upside to any ceasefire that might result under present conditions and easy to see the risks.\n\nV. Could Changing Russias Government Bring Peace?\n\nWhile, in theory, a change in Kremlin leadership might create opportunities for conflict resolution, in practice the war is unlikely to end due to pressure from inside Russia. It would be dangerous to try forcing such a change from the outside. A popular revolution is difficult to fathom. On an autocratic path even before its February offensive in Ukraine (Russia has not had free elections or competitive politics in over two decades), the Kremlin has cracked down even harder on dissent and the flow of information since 24 February, driving many opposition-minded citizens to flee the country. Putin and his inner circle control the security services, the media, elections, the courts and the economy. State-approved propaganda rules the airwaves, with independent voices available only via a reliable virtual private network (VPN), access to which can be difficult. No surprise, then, that opinion polls throughout Russia indicate support for the war and for the government. Although these polls are not reliable in a country where social media posts can draw prison time, they do offer evidence of unwillingness on Russian citizens part to express opinions critical of the Kremlins current direction. More dissent could emerge, though the odds are against it. For example, more Russians could lose their inhibitions as frustration grows with war and economic hardship, but even then, the Russian state is set up to prevent real opposition from finding expression. As of now, dissenters face a choice between leaving the country and prison. There are two exceptions. One is the freer rein given to those who support the war, but want it carried out more forcefully and viciously, and to see the forces better prepared. The second is the small wave of cross-national protests by mainly female relatives of the mobilised, complaining that their male kin are inadequately equipped and prepared. While they have faced roadblocks from officialdom, they have generally not been detained. Indeed, the Kremlin took this situation seriously enough to organise an audience with Putin for a group of wives and mothers. These, however, were a handpicked group of government workers and other loyalists. Those demanding an end to war and peace talks with Ukraine were not invited. Alternatively, it is possible that someone within the system would take over from Putin, perhaps even with his blessing were he, for example, to become ill though nothing suggests any such person emerging any time soon. In this case, peace could plausibly follow, simply because any new leader might need to free up resources otherwise tied up in the war effort in order to consolidate support. Thus far, however, though views of the war within Putins inner circle reportedly vary, its members seem to believe that they are better off supporting the current dispensation. \"They [Putins inner circle] may have different opinions on the war, but in the Russian political system it does not matter they will all do what Putin decides to do and no one will argue with him\", a political adviser of a Kremlin-connected Russian businessman told Crisis Group.\n\nA Western effort to overthrow the government is among the scenarios that Russias political and military leadership fear the most.\n\nNor is it clear exactly how Western states could act to effect a change of government, though all evidence suggests that even trying would carry tremendous danger. As noted above, a Western effort to overthrow the government is among the scenarios that Russias political and military leadership fear the most. Support for any group seeking regime change in Russia would feed the Kremlins sense that it is besieged by the West, increasing nuclear risks. If Russia is to change, it will in all likelihood have to change on its own from within which, again, appears unlikely to happen for now. While Western states and Ukraine may not be able to change Russia, they should stay true to their values and continue to engage with dissidents, championing their rights, and with exiles, offering safe haven to those who flee Putins increasingly dictatorial rule. Indeed, more openness to Russians could, over time, generate more support for better relations with the West or, at least, undermine the Kremlins arguments that the West is hostile to Russians.\n\nVI.

Gaps formed in our air defense system,\" he said.\n\nKnutov further noted that many believe American satellites can \"see these gaps well.\" \"I dont doubt that, and neither do the specialists.\"\n\nRussian TV had been tight-lipped about the recent drone attacks on airfields deep inside the country Today pundit Yuri Knutov admitted that there were gaps in Russia's air defence because most systems had been moved closer to Ukraine Host Olga Skabeyeva wasn't impressed pic.twitter.com/wpKIa2LS4S Francis Scarr (@francis_scarr) December 7, 2022\n\nRussian Expert Warns Of Attack On Moscow\n\nThe recent remarks by Knutov came after Ukraine allegedly conducted three devastating drone strikes deep inside Russia within a week.\n\nOn December 5, Ukrainian forces struck Engels-2 and Dyagilevo Air Force Bases, which are located very close to the Russian capital city of Moscow than the borders with Ukraine.\n\nThe strikes were reportedly carried out using a modified Soviet-era unmanned aerial vehicle called the Tu-141 Strizh.\n\nThe attacks on the air bases were a significant blow to Kremlin, as they marked the first time Ukraine had conducted such long-range strikes inside Russia.\n\nHowever, the Ukrainians did not stop there. The next day, they attacked the Khalino military airfield, located around 280 kilometers from the Ukrainian border in the Kursk Oblast.\n\nIn Russia tonight there was a new attack by an unknown drone on the Khalino military airfield in Kursk. As a result of the attack, an oil reservoir near the airport caught fire. pic.twitter.com/d14c1PJW1N Special Kherson Cat ??? (@bayraktar_1love) December 6, 2022\n\nSpeaking about these attacks, Knutov postulated that the American satellites provided intelligence to the Ukrainian forces and created the route for Ukraines Soviet-era drone to circumvent Russian air defense systems and reach the airfield, where according to him, it was hit by a surface-to-air missile, which was most likely from the Pantsir missile system.\n\nKnutov explained that this is why the interception range was so low, only around 10 kilometers; therefore, the fragments fell on the airfield site.\n\nHe suggested that if there were longer-range air defense systems like Buk-M3 or a Vityaz-353 protecting these air bases, the drones launched by Ukrainian forces would have been shot down around 50 to 60 kilometers away.\n\nKnutov further warned that emboldened by these successful long-range strikes inside Russia, the Ukrainian military might also attack Moscow. \"And theres a chance they (Ukrainians) will try to launch things towards Moscow. I dont doubt that,\" said Knutov.\n\nRussia Lacking Intelligence\n\nWhile Knutovs warnings of a possible Ukrainian attack on Moscow are certainly noteworthy, what is more important, is his allegations of American satellites providing intelligence to Ukrainian forces.\n\nIt is no secret that Ukraine has significantly benefited from an unprecedented amount of intelligence from its NATO allies, which also includes real-time information on Russian troop movements. It is not clear if this includes high-resolution imagery from Western military satellites.\n\nHowever, even Western commercial satellite companies can provide high-quality and real-time satellite imagery, which could be used to gather actionable intelligence, like in the case of the recent Ukrainian attack on the Engels-2 air base.\n\nUkraines drone attack on the Engels-2 air base was prompted by the commercial satellite imagery provided by Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs, which showed dozens of bombers and cruise missiles amassed at this air base, suggesting another imminent large-scale attack across Ukraine.\n\nOn the other hand, Russia lacks enough satellites to fight a war like Ukraine.\n\nPavel Luzin, an expert on the Russian Armed Forces, notes that the countrys space intelligence capabilities comprise only 12 satellites.\n\nOnly two of these, namely Persona No. 2 (Cosmos 2486) and Persona No. 3 (Cosmos 2506), are optical intelligence satellites that travel along sun-synchronous orbits at an altitude of 700 kilometers.\n\nRussia also has three Bars-M satellites, the Cosmos 2503, Cosmos 2515, and Cosmos 2556, launched in 2015, 2016, and 2022, respectively. However, these three mainly conduct topography and mapping missions.\n\nLuzin noted that the Russian military also relies on five Kanopus-V civilian optical imaging satellites that rely on electronics and software produced in the UK. However, each can only cover the same territory once every 15 days. Also, these low-resolution satellites are only good for intelligence on large stationary objects.\n\nAnother civilian optical imaging satellite includes a single Resurs-P satellite with a revisit rate of 3-6 days which could allow the Russian military to plan air raids and monitor damage to Ukraines cities and towns.\n\nIn contrast, a Russian study of the US military campaign in Iraq in 2003 found that the US military depended on around 30 intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance satellites of various types, including the ones provided by allies and private companies.\n\nAlso, Russia faces much more formidable challenges in Ukraine today than the US faced around two decades ago in Iraq. The Ukrainian armed forces are much better trained and equipped than the Iraqi forces, and the battlefield environment in Iraq was less urbanized and less populated than in Ukraine.\n\nMoreover, the existing Russian optical intelligence satellites do not even match the quality of the US assets dating to the early 2000s.",

On its roof, the red, white and blue star of the Russian army can be seen, with letters reading: \"For the people of Mariupol.\"\n\nMaxar says the building appears to be a military facility. However the BBC is unable to verify this or confirm what the new building is being used for.\n\nMaxar\n\nThe newly constructed Russian building in Mariupol suggests Russia is seeking to dig in in the city\n\nMoscow's forces laid siege to the city for almost three months earlier this year, and constant artillery barrages left much of it in ruins.\n\nUkrainian officials estimated last month that some 25,000 civilians were killed in the strikes, while the UN said it had confirmed the deaths of 1,348 civilians, but said the true death toll was \"likely thousands higher\".\n\nImages of the city's graveyard appear to show it being extended. Russian troops have reportedly been removing dead bodies from destroyed buildings in recent months and taking them away for burial.

Pool photo by Mikhail Metzel\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia warned on Wednesday that the fighting in Ukraine would be protracted, while attempting to allay the worst fears of an increasingly war-weary population.\n\nSpeaking at a televised meeting Mr. Putin said the war in Ukraine \"might be a long process,\" moving further from Kremlins blitzkrieg rhetoric at the start of the invasion.\n\nBut he added that, for now, he would not call up more combat troops to serve in what his government calls a \"special military operation\" beyond the 300,000 drafted in September.\n\n\"In these conditions, the talk about some additional mobilization efforts make no sense,\" the Russian leader said. \"There is no need for this for the state and for the Defense Ministry.\"\n\nMr. Putins comments, made to the Kremlins human rights council a group of loyal journalists, activists and public figures came after brazen drone attacks by Ukrainian armed forces on targets in the Russian hinterland.\n\nThose attacks, combined with the conscription of hundreds of thousands of men to join the fighting ranks, have brought the reality of war closer to the attention of a largely apathetic Russian population.\n\n\"The people are getting tired, and Putin knows that a protracted war cannot be popular,\" said Abbas Gallyamov, a political scientist who once wrote speeches for Mr. Putin but has broken with him. \"He does not want a second wave of mobilization, and is trying to show that he has enough men to last through the winter.\"\n\nMr. Gallyamov said the Kremlin was betting that winter conditions would reduce the intensity of the fighting and that the conflict would settle into a war of attrition favoring Russia, as the reduction of Russian energy deliveries to Europe gradually erodes Western support for Ukraine.\n\nAt the human rights council meeting, Mr. Putin said that Russia had no choice but to intervene militarily in Ukraine in response to Western-backed aggression against ethnic Russians there, a claim the Kremlin has often made to justify the war.\n\nMr. Putin said that half of the 300,000 civilians conscripted to fight in Ukraine as part of a call-up announced in September were still training outside combat zones. About 77,000 conscripts are currently engaged in fighting in Ukraine, he said, and others are serving in territorial defense units or aiding training efforts.\n\nMr. Putin announced the \"partial mobilization\" of troops in late September after a series of setbacks on the battlefield, a move Western analysts said highlighted Russias disastrous losses of professional soldiers.\n\nThe decision shook Russian society. Thousands of Russians rushed to leave the country, some paying exorbitant prices for flights to whatever destinations they could manage to get tickets to.\n\nChaos and inefficiency hampered the mobilization. Many conscripts have reported that little training was provided and that whole units were left without commanders. Some complained that they had to buy their own equipment and uniforms.\n\nIn the face of criticism, Mr. Putin announced the end of the call-up in October, although he did not issue an official order to stop it. That has prompted fears that the Kremlin might announce another wave at any moment.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Putin appeared to acknowledge that the war, which began in February, is taking much longer that the Kremlin had expected. But he also said that Russia had become bigger by annexing Ukrainian territory.\n\n\"This is a significant result,\" Mr. Putin said, referring to his move in September to declare four Ukrainian provinces part of Russia, a move that has been condemned as illegal by Ukraine and its international allies.\n\nMr. Putin also played down the possibility of using nuclear weapons, despite his veiled threat in the past that they were an option in Ukraine. He said that even though the threat of a nuclear war \"is growing,\" Russia \"is not crazy,\" and the Kremlin was not going to \"brandish these nuclear weapons like a razor.\"",

News reports said two Russian airfields have been rocked by explosions. Maxar Technologies/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAnother explosion was reported at the Dyagilevo military airbase in Ryazan, a city less than 150 miles from Moscow and also houses Tu-95 bombers. Russian state media initially reported that a fuel tanker exploded at the base, killing three people and wounding at least five others.\n\nRussian officials initially avoided commenting on the explosions but on Monday evening, Russias defense ministry said \"Soviet-made\" Ukrainian drones had caused it. But the ministry said Russian air defenses had shot down the drones and the damage was caused by their wreckage landing on the airfields.\n\nHours after the attacks, Russia launched a new barrage of missile strikes against Ukraine, including from strategic bombers, again targeting its energy infrastructure. Ukraines air force claimed it shot down 60 of 70 Russian cruise missiles, but the strikes left several regions partially without power. Zelenskyy said the Russian attacks had also killed four people Monday.\n\nRussias defense ministry claimed the drone attacks on its airbases had failed to disrupt the planned strikes, claiming they had destroyed 17 targets.\n\nThe airbase explosions, nonetheless, were a significant shift, marking the first time Ukraine has sought to hit the bombers that for months have regularly attacked its civilian infrastructure with impunity and recently sought to bring its energy grid to its knees. The Russian bombers usually launch cruise missiles from outside Ukraines borders, well beyond the reach of its air defenses, experts said.\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman flies a drone during an operation against Russian positions at an undisclosed location in the Donetsk region, Ukraine, Sunday, Dec. 4, 2022. Roman Chop/AP\n\nSatellite images from the company Maxar taken over the two days before Mondays attacks showed roughly two dozen Russian bombers parked at the Engels-2 base.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said two of its aircraft had suffered \"superficial\" damage in the blasts. Video circulating on Russian social media appeared to show two Tu-22 bombers at the Dyagilevo base with damage to their tail ends, standing next to a burned out fuel truck.\n\nRussian pro-war commentators reacted with fury to the attacks, calling it a humiliation that the countrys nuclear airbases were vulnerable to conventional drones and blaming it on negligence among commanders.\n\nA top advisor to Zelenskyy posted a cryptic comment on Twitter mocking Russia over the explosions.\n\n\"The Earth is round discovery made by Galileo. Astronomy was not studied in Kremlin, giving preference to court astrologers,\" wrote Mykhailo Podolyak, the presidential adviser. \"If it was, they would know: if something is launched into other countries airspace, sooner or later unknown flying objects will return to departure point.\"",

Another 22 Kalibr missiles were fired from ships in Russia's Black Sea Fleet.\n\n\"We also have information on the use of Tu-22 M3 bombers with rocket launchers, which are the most powerful in terms of combat weight,\" Ihnat said. \"Guided air missiles were also launched from Su-25 fighters.\"\n\nAir-raid sirens lasted for three hours as officials warned people to take shelter.\n\nAndriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential office, told Ukrainians to heed the alarm. Reports on social media showed hundreds of people sheltering in subway stations in the capital, Kyiv.\n\nThe missile strikes injured one person in Odesa and hit energy infrastructure in the city, where all substations and backup lines were not working and where there is no water supply.\n\nIn Kryviy Rih in the Dnipropetrovsk region, critical infrastructure has been damaged and large-scale blackouts are possible, authorities said. Electricity was turned off as a precaution in the northern Sumy region, and possible disruptions were reported in the northern Chernihiv region and the western Ternopil region.\n\nZelenskiy said engineers had already started to restore electricity, and Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that, despite being hit by Russian missiles, Ukraine's energy system \"functions and will remain intact.\"\n\nJohn Kirby, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, condemned the latest Russian strikes, calling them a reminder of Russian President Vladimir Putin's brutality. The United States is in constant contact with Ukraine and will continue to provide Kyiv with everything it needs for its defense, Kirby said.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Twitter that he had a conversation with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on December 5 after the Russian missile strike. Reznikov said he and Austin discussed further steps to strengthen Ukrainian air defense and thanked the U.S. for its continued support.\n\nEarlier on December 5, at least one large explosion occurred at a Russian military air base in the Saratov region, about 600 kilometers east of Ukraine, while another blast was reported by Russian state media at an airfield outside Ryazan, southeast of Moscow.\n\nSocial-media posts by residents in the cities of Engels and Saratov seemed to show a large explosion at the Engels-2 air base at about 6 a.m. local time on December 5.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the attacks were carried out by Ukrainian drones. The ministry confirmed news reports of damage to two Tu-95 strategic bombers and the deaths of Russian servicemen. The ministry also claimed that both drones were shot down.\n\nUkrainian authorities have not publicly commented on the blasts, but a senior Ukrainian official quoted anonymously by The New York Times, said the drones were launched from Ukrainian territory and at least two planes were destroyed at one of the Russian bases and several more were damaged.\n\nThe latest volley of Russian strikes against Ukraine came the same day that a price cap of $60 per barrel imposed on seaborne Russian oil by the Group of Seven (G7) leading economies, the European Union, and several importing countries took effect.\n\nThe price cap, which has been joined by the United States, Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom, was intended to punish Moscow for its unprovoked aggression against neighboring Ukraine.\n\nIt stipulates that Russian oil can only be shipped to third countries using G7 or EU tankers, insurance companies, or credit institutions if the cargo is purchased at or below the price cap.\n\nThe EU has also introduced an embargo of seaborne Russian oil that also took effect on December 5.\n\nMoscow remained defiant over the move and said it would not recognize the restrictions.\n\nThe United States doesn't expect that Russia's threats to have any long-term impact on global oil prices, Kirby said.\n\nThe cap will lock in the discount on Russian oil, and countries like China and India will be able to bargain for steep price reductions, he said.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AP, and The New York Times",

Tripoli-based advisory High Council of State (HCS) Chair Khalid al-Meshri 14 Nov accused militiamen affiliated with Tripoli-based PM Abdelhamid Dabaiba of \"besieging\" HCS headquarters; said HCS had convened session to follow up on tentative agreement with eastern-based legislature House of Representatives (HoR) to work toward forming new unity govt. Dabaiba, who is opposed to HoR-HSC negotiations, immediately denounced \"incitement and exaggeration\", saying only \"a few\" protesters had gathered outside HCS building, accused Meshri of making secret \"power-sharing\" deals to delay elections. HoR Speaker Aguila Saleh same day condemned \"threats and intimidation by armed groups using force\" against HCS. Dabaiba 29 Nov reportedly accused Meshri and Saleh of \"systematically obstructing elections\". East-based military commander Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar around 22 Nov weighed in on political crisis, saying \"time has come for the Libyan people to put an end to failed experiments and dead ends\", accusing politicians of \"worshipping their seats of power\".\n\nGreek FMs refusal to meet Tripoli-based govt minister sparked diplomatic spat. After Tripoli-based Govt of National Unity (GNU) in Oct signed deal with Trkyie on oil and gas exploration in areas of Mediterranean contested by Athens, Greek FM Nikos Dendias 17 Nov canceled Tripoli visit upon landing to avoid being welcomed by his Libyan counterpart, FM Najla al-Mangoush; Dendias claimed he had come to meet Tripoli-based Presidential Council head Mohamed al-Menfi.

Week by week, there are yet more signs that Moscows military machine cannot perform as advertised.\n\nFootage on Russian media shows the aftermath of an alleged drone strike Tuesday at an airfield in Kursk, Russia. MIC IZVESTIA/IZ.RU/Reuters\n\nOn Tuesday, a Russian official said another drone strike had hit a Russian airfield in Kursk, nearer to the Ukrainian border.\n\nUkraine has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the blasts, in keeping with Kyivs policy of official silence around attacks inside Russia or in Russian-occupied Crimea. An aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to gloat over the strikes, tweeting cryptically that \"if something is launched into other countries airspace, sooner or later unknown flying objects will return to departure point.\"\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Unheard of': Ret. US Army Major reacts to drone strikes in Russian airfield 02:34 - Source: CNN\n\nRussian state news agencies heaped discomfort onto humiliation by adding Monday that the initial two airfields in question had in fact been photographed by a US-based commercial satellite imaging company over the weekend.\n\nThe low-tech tools employed in this embarrassment pop the balloon of Russias peer status to NATO.\n\nA satellite image shows an overview of Engels Air Base, in Saratov, Russia on December 4. Maxar Technologies/Reuters\n\nRussian humiliation is usually accompanied with concerns it may escalate the conflict. But it is hard to know what else Russia could do to Ukraine that it has not already done. It has leveled cities, hit civilian infrastructure callously and relentlessly when it can, killed thousands of civilians and yet more troops, and bombed maternity hospitals and shelters marked with the word \"Children.\"\n\nAt some point, the labored assumption that Russia has magic, non-apocalyptic buttons left to press will begin to fade. Let us first quickly discuss why a Russian nuclear strike seems off the table, at least for now. After months of deeply chilling nuclear rhetoric spanning potential \"accidents\" at nuclear power stations, to evidence-free talk of Ukraine using a dirty bomb, to open threats invoking Moscows nuclear arsenal Moscow seems to have eased off on the Armageddon rhetoric.\n\nChina has been very clear it feels such talk must stop. So has India. At the end of last month, Putin found himself in an extraordinary moment, signing a decree with the president of Kazakhstan reiterating that nuclear war can never be won and should never be fought. It was a reinforcement of a 2006 statement between Moscow and the Central Asian states it back then sought to lead as a geopolitical power. How times have changed: Moscow is no longer looking outwards to the West as it began to 16 years ago. And Kazakhstan, who as recently as January depended on Moscow to put down internal unrest, is looking to China and Europe for its future, and seemingly nudging Putin to pledge again that nukes are bad.\n\nNone of this excludes the remote possibility the Kremlin will give in to the lunatic fringe on state TV talk shows and unleash its worst weapons. But it is clear that everyone Putin knows is now reminding him of the stark consequences were he to do so.\n\nSo what does Russia have left? Chemical weapons are a possibility, but likely have formed a part of the warnings it has received to not use nuclear force. Moscows choices appear limited to the more accurate or savage use of the same conventional brutality it is currently throwing at Ukraines cities almost daily.\n\nThis is the most damaging side effect of how public the exhaustion of Russias military has been: There is no real \"fear factor\" left. State TV commentators liked to muse months ago that Russia has thus far been fighting with \"gloves on,\" but it is clear the gloves have long come off, their opponent has learned to duck their punches, and also brought a knife to the ring.\n\nThis open degradation of Russia as a power was compounded by claims hard to confirm from Ukrainian officials that over four in five Russian missiles fired Monday were intercepted by Kyivs boosted air defense systems. Again, this is another of the certainties held about the Russian military shattered. Its air attack and defense systems are being outperformed in the same week.\n\nSo where does this go? The West are caught in a bind. The better Ukraines military performs on the battlefield, the less likely Kyiv are to agree with some European capitals that peace talks are needed with Russia. When you are winning, why agree to talk about a form of losing? And NATO cannot begin to slow the supply of weapons or face criticism even from its own citizens that it is leaving Ukrainians to die. It cannot really demand Kyiv accept the permanent loss of some of its territory as part of a settlement without essentially endorsing Russias invasion.\n\nInstead, the dynamic is all against Russia. When they are weak, they are not suddenly somehow strong they are just weak, to paraphrase one Western officials private analysis. Do these slow and continual humiliations bring the day closer when Putin struggles to control his own hierarchy, or succumb to pressure to withdraw from territory he has occupied since 2014?\n\nAs we wait for the answer, the trajectories are unchanged: Ukraine: cold in winter, but winning and slowly better armed. Russia: cold in winter, but losing and slowly broken militarily. The key variable is Western patience and support.",

                "cc_text": "Summary\n\nOn October 10, Victoria Amelina, a prize winning author, sent out a series of urgent tweets. \"Im in Kyiv and alive,\" she started off, explaining that she was filming Russian strikes on Kyiv as best as she could. She tweeted out a list of the buildings damaged or destroyed during the attack, including the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, the Khanenko Museum, Kyiv Picture Gallery, National Philharmonic of Ukraine, Maksymovych Scientific Library, and Kyiv City Teachers House. Her anguish at these losses and her understanding of why they had been targeted was crystal clear: \"I know they want us, Ukrainian writers, to disappear . . . they target Ukrainian culture.\"\n\nCulturepast, present, and futureis on the front lines of the brutal war on Ukraine and cultural erasure is a central tactic of Russias campaign of aggression and violence in Ukraine, which has gone on for over eight years. Russian President Vladimir Putins repeated false claims that a distinct Ukrainian history, language, and culture do not exist, serve as one of his central justifications for waging war on and occupying Ukraine. He seeks not only to control Ukrainian territory, but to erase Ukrainian culture and identity, and to impose Russian language, as well as a manipulated, chauvinistic, militaristic version of Russias culture, history, and worldview, on Ukrainian people.\n\nOleksandra Yakubenko, currently working on PEN Americas efforts to support Ukrainian artists at risk and an expert on Ukrainian culture, thinks that Putins efforts to destroy Ukrainian culture have had the opposite effect. She explained how her Ukrainian identity was \"reawakened\" in 2014 in the aftermath of the Maidan Revolution that ousted President Viktor Yanukovychwhat Ukrainians call the Revolution of Dignityand following Russias occupation of Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Since then, she noticed \"cultural life just bloomed and bloomed.\" She ascribed this strengthening, in part, to the vitality of Ukraines cultural sector and their participation in and support for democracy and human rights, and later the war effort. She now believes that \"our culture and our physical survival are intertwinedthey go hand in hand.\"\n\nIn an interview from July 2022, the Ukrainian novelist, poet, and essayist Yuri Andrukhovych shared similar views on Ukrainian culture and writing as a bulwark against Russian aggression: \"Its quite ironic that each attempt Russia has made to destroy Ukrainian culture has had the opposite effect . . . There is now a widespread tendency among Ukrainians to speak entirely in Ukrainian . . . New poems, novels, stories, essays, etc. will be written in Ukrainian, and of course they will be read and discussed. It is the best way to overcome the Russian aggressors and to survive in that humanitarian catastrophe they have brought upon us.\"\n\nRussia has carried out extensive, coordinated actions to marginalize, undermine, and ultimately eliminate the tangible and intangible manifestations of Ukrainian culture since its illegal occupation of Crimea, and parts of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russias actions, which included damaging important cultural buildings and undermining the teaching of and in Ukrainian in those territories, now serve as a blueprint for their cultural erasure efforts in areas they have invaded and occupied since the full-scale war against Ukraine began on February 24, 2022. They have been supplemented by physical destruction of cultural infrastructure on a massive scale.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Russian government has sought to destroy Ukrainian culture. Ukrainian thinkers, writers, linguists, artists, and scholars over the last three centuries have faced Imperial Russian and Soviet efforts to deny, assimilate, and eliminate their culture and language. Olesya Khromeychuk, a historian and director of the Ukrainian Institute in London, detailed efforts by various Russian tsars to eliminate Ukrainian culture, including banning Ukrainian-language publications, prohibiting cultural societies, and exiling or imprisoning public intellectuals. She explained that \"writers, poets, and artists became the figures who shaped national identity.\"\n\nDeliberate attacks on culture, including efforts to erase culture, by state and non-state actors, are not new. The bombing of Guernica, a Basque town in northern Spain, by the German air force in support of General Franco during the Spanish Civil War; the systematic destruction of Polish libraries and archives by the Nazis during World War II; attacks on cultural heritage sites, including Palmyra in Syria, by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are among the better-known efforts to destroy and erase culture during wars. In 2016, the International Criminal Court (ICC) handed down its first conviction of a war crime \"consisting in intentionally directing attacks against religious and historic buildings in Timbuktu, Mali.\"\n\nThe occupation and war have wrought an incalculable toll on Ukraines cultural voices, creators, and workers. They are amongst the thousands killed and injured by Russian attacks, or detained and threatened by Russian forces. Many have fled their homes and communities to reach safety; they have lost loved ones, homes, and precious possessions. They have been cut off from their creative communities and colleagues, and they have seen their studios, galleries, and exhibition spaces destroyed, damaged, and closed. The need to focus on survival has frequently taken precedence over creative work and even when Ukrainian culture is not being deliberately targeted, the war has deeply disrupted creative production.\n\nRussian bombardments and other attacks have destroyed and damaged hundreds of places where Ukrainians enjoy and experience culture, sites small and large, local and national, from community cultural houses to fine art museums. Some of these attacks were deliberate, targeted attacks, such as on Mariupols Academic Regional Drama Theater, which was sheltering hundreds of civilians, including children, when Russian aircraft dropped two bombs on it in March 2022. In the Kyiv region, in the first days of the Russian assault, a Russian missile struck the Ivankiv Historical and Local History Museum, setting it on fire, the only building in the village to be struck during that time.\n\nRussian forces have also repeatedly and indiscriminately attacked densely populated areas using explosive weapons and cluster bombs, which have been banned by an international treaty. These attacks have caused widespread death and injury, as well as massive destruction and damage to civilian infrastructure, including cultural heritage sites, book printing houses, libraries, and places of spiritual interest. The damage and destruction cannot be seen as simply incidental, collateral damage resulting from Russian military operations targeting Ukrainian military targets. Rather, the magnitude of the destruction suggests a deliberate campaign to destroy civilian infrastructure, rendering some cities barely habitable, and an attempt to destroy civilian morale.\n\nBoth the targeted and indiscriminate attacks carried out by the Russian military against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine are violations of International humanitarian law (IHL) and, per the findings of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, actions by Russian forces amount to war crimes. The conduct of Russias military and occupation forces also violates international human rights law, including Ukrainians right to culture.\n\nUkrainian writers, poets, artists, and cultural defenders demonstrate remarkable resilience and resistance in the face of this brutal conflict and attack against their Ukrainian culture. Many draw strength from their connections to Ukrainian culture and are actively seeking new ways to produce and promote culture. Writers are writing wartime diaries. There are literary readings in bookstores against the backdrop of air-raid sirens, and concerts in metro stations doubling as bomb shelters. \"Good Evening (Where Are You From?),\" also known by its popular name, \"Good evening, we are from Ukraine,\" is a song by the electronic duo ProBass and Hardi. It was released just before the start of the war, and it now plays in bomb shelters; the phrase is printed on T-shirts and trends on Twitter, and is often used by officials, including Vitaliy Kim, the governor of the southern region of Mykolaiv, when they address the Ukrainian people, signifying and strengthening Ukrainian resilience. Many believe that the survival of Ukraine as a country and people is inextricably linked with the survival of its culture, and they carry that burden with them. Tamara Shevchuk, a painter, graphic designer, and art teacher, works in a village in the Kyiv region that was occupied by the Russians for 24 days. She said: \"War does not spare anyone, and the cultural front is just as important as the military one.\"",

                "cc_text": "On December 5, two Ukrainian strikes on Russian air bases deep into Russian territory and far from the frontlines produced a painful shock for Russian forces and could signify a further mutation, if not escalation, of the war.\n\nEach time Ukrainian forces deliver a long-range high-precision attack from the sinking of the Moskva cruiser in mid-April 2022 to the strike on Saky air base in Crimea in early August and the swarm attack of air and naval drones on Sevastopol in late October Russia has been caught unprepared and has struggled to find a response.\n\nIn retaliation for the December 5 strikes, Russia sought to hit back with yet another missile strike on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, but the strength of this operation was slightly below the six previous missile attacks from October 10, and this was certainly no surprise for Ukraines missile defense (Nezavisimoe voennoe obozrenie, December 8).\n\nAttacks deep within Russian territory\n\nThe material impact from the Ukrainian strikes on the Engels air base in Saratov region and the Dyagilevo air base in Ryazan region was limited: one Tu-95MS bomber was damaged during the former attack, while one Tu-22M bomber was damaged during the latter, in which several casualties were also reported (Meduza, December 7).\n\nThe capacity of Ukrainian forces to hit targets 700 kilometers away from the launch site truly astonished the Russian top brass and infuriated \"military-patriotic\" bloggers, who deplored the carelessness and feebleness of Russias air defense (Topwar.ru, December 7). Russian official sources quickly clarified that the strikes were delivered by old Soviet Tu-141 Strizh drones, designed for intelligence and reconnaissance but recently modernized to carry a small warhead, of which only a score remain in Ukraine (Izvestiya, December 7; Currenttime.tv, December 9). Kyiv did not confirm this data, but it has succeeded in addition to receiving Bayraktar TB2 strike drones from Turkey and Switchblade 300 loitering munitions from the United States in producing several of its own long-range weapon systems, despite multiple Russian missile strikes on its industrial facilities (Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 6).\n\nthe Ukrainian command takes care to target military bases and assets, in sharp contrast with indiscriminate Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and residential areas\n\nUsing these capabilities for attacks deep within Russian territory, the Ukrainian command takes care to target military bases and assets, in sharp contrast with indiscriminate Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and residential areas. For instance, the Khalino airfield near Kursk, where the fuel depot was hit on December 6, used to be a civilian facility, but since the start of the war, it has been used exclusively for military purposes (Svoboda, December 6). What is particularly significant about the strike on the Engels air base is the fact that it is a major facility for Russian strategic aviation, and as such, many Moscow commentators have emphasized the first-ever direct hit on an element of the strategic triad, pivotally important for national security (Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 7). The squadrons of Tu-95MS and Tu-160 bombers based in Engels (which appear to be a rare observers of a sadly dilapidated locale) are constantly used for launching cruise missiles on Ukrainian territory from a safe distance usually over the Caspian Sea, which veils the misfiring missiles making it a legitimate target for Ukrainian retaliation (Novayagazeta.eu, December 7).\n\nAsserting the right to attack military assets in every region of the Russian Federation, the Ukrainian command is avoiding creating any threats for Belarus, despite the fact that a significant grouping of Russian forces is deployed on Minsks territory (see EDM, November 9). In early December 2022, Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka greeted Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and asserted that Belarussian and Russian troops were training together as a joint army (Kommersant, December 3; Nezavisimoe voennoe obozrenie, December 8). In this light, Ukraine must prepare for a possible new attack from the north, but it is, nevertheless, exercising restraint, noting that not one Iskander missile has been launched from Belarussian territory, even if its airspace has been used by Russian bombers for cross-border missile strikes (Svoboda, December 3).\n\nMilitary ties with Iran\n\nThe war, therefore, shows no horizontal escalation while its theater deepens into Russia, but it has also gained wider international dimensions, as Western military support for Ukraine strengthens and includes more effective weapon systems and as Russia seeks to expand military ties with Iran preparing, according to diplomatic sources, a new treaty on comprehensive cooperation (RIA Novosti, December 7). The main content of this cooperation in the past few months has been the supply of Shahed-136 drones, which supplemented Russian missile strikes and saturated Ukrainian air defense with swarm attacks (Novayagazeta.eu, October 21). The effectiveness of these attacks has steeply declined, as Ukraine deployed special teams of drone-hunters. As a result, only Odesa, which drones launched from Crimea can approach by sea, has suffered significant damage in recent days (Currenttime.tv, December 10).\n\nwhat Tehran wants from Moscow are weapon systems it cannot produce\n\nRussia needs new shipments of drones and wants to import intermediate-range ballistic missiles (the Iskanders being in short supply) from Iran, but the question remains regarding the Russian goods and services to be provided in return for these weapons (Topwar.ru, December 10). One proposition was to increase the export of natural gas, as the volumes pumped to Europe have sharply declined, but Uzbekistan has rejected Putins plan for a \"gas alliance,\" and Kazakhstan is also far from enthusiastic about this transit route (Forbes.ru, December 8). In truth, what Tehran wants from Moscow are weapon systems it cannot produce, including helicopters and surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles, and the Kremlin is assessing such options against possible harsh reactions in Saudi Arabia and Israel (Svoboda, December 9). Denials cannot ensure secrecy around these preparations, therefore the US and other members of the Western coalition are fine-tuning the sanctions regime to pre-empt the dangerous expansion of the weapons trade between the two rogue regimes (Kommersant, December 9).\n\nWestern concerns about potential disproportional actions from Moscow in response to Ukrainian long-distance strikes are gradually diminishing, as Russian forces are facing severe difficulties in sustaining the volume of weekly missile attacks and have few other options for retaliation. Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought to boost domestic support for the \"special military operation\" by annexing four Ukrainian regions, but that political blunder has instead severely compromised Russias territorial integrity.\n\nNow, Moscow cannot assert that a Ukrainian strike on a military target in the Kursk region is a wholly different national security matter as compared to a strike on the rear echelons of its forces still attempting to capture Bakhmut. The Iranian connection cannot possibly grant Russia capabilities that would assuredly undermine the Ukrainian will to resist Moscows aggression and to deny Russian troops any safe supply routes and areas for regrouping.\n\nPavel K Baev is a Research Professor at PRIO",

ANNOUNCER: \"This Week\" with George Stephanopoulos starts right now.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nMARTHA RADDATZ, ABC HOST (voiceover): Finally free.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I spoke with Brittney Griner. She's safe, she's on a plane, she's on her way home.\n\nRADDATZ: New details on the secret negotiations that led to that high-stakes prisoner swap. As the White House faces mounting criticism for leaving behind former Marine Paul Whelan.\n\nANTONY BLINKEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: This was not a choice of which American to bring home. The choice was, one or none.\n\nREP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Its made Putin stronger and its made Americans more vulnerable.\n\nRADDATZ: We're one-on-one with National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby and Congressman Adam Kinzinger on concern Putin scored a victory at the expense of national security.\n\nSenate shakeup.\n\nSEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA, (I-AZ): I've registered as an Arizonian Independent.\n\nRADDATZ: Senator Kyrsten Sinema leaves the Democratic Party just days after a Senate win in Georgia secures a Democratic majority. Our political director Rick Klein breaks down what it means for the president's agenda and our Powerhouse Roundtable covers all the week's politics.\n\nPlus, mission to the moon.\n\nUNKNOWN MALE: It's an amazing time not just for NASA but really for the whole country and the world.\n\nRADDATZ: Spacecraft Orion prepares for re-entry this morning. We're live at the Johnson Space Center as NASA inches closer to a return to the moon.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nANNOUNCER: From ABC News, it's \"This Week.\" Here now, Martha Raddatz.\n\nRADDATZ (on camera): Good morning, and welcome to \"This Week.\"\n\nIt was a week of political surprises here at home and a long-awaited breakthrough overseas.\n\nIn Washington, Senator Kyrsten Sinemas abrupt decision to leave the Democratic Party caught Capitol Hill off-guard. And while it wont rob Democrats of their majority, it will complicate their agenda and add new uncertainty. We'll discuss all of that in a moment.\n\nBut first, that surprise diplomatic breakthrough between the U.S. and Russia, the prisoner swap freeing basketball star Brittney Griner who is now receiving medical care at an army facility in Texas. While her freedom has been celebrated across the country, President Biden is facing fierce blowback over the deal. Former Marine Paul Whelan still in a Russian prison while a notorious Russian arms dealer jailed for conspiring to kill Americans is now free.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nRADDATZ (voiceover): For WNBA star Brittney Griner, her 10-months of detention finally over.\n\nUNKNOWN MALE: Whats your mood?\n\nBRITTNEY GRINER, WNBA STAR: Happy.\n\nRADDATZ: While the release itself was widely welcomed, that dramatic prisoner exchange, Griners swapped for one of the world's most notorious arms trafficker Viktor Bout became a wave of bipartisan criticism.\n\nSEN. CHRIS COONS, (D-DE): The more we engage in such exchanges, the more Americans are at risk of being scooped up and held as leverage.\n\nMCCARTHY: Think about the exchange here, the merchant of death for a WNBA star who was picked up for marijuana, what a victory for Putin.\n\nRADDATZ: Add to that the American left behind. Paul Whelan, now four years in a Russian prison.\n\nDAVID WHELAN, BROTHER OF PAUL WHELAN: Having an evening to process it privately gave us a real grace to be able to, you know, be angry at Russia.\n\nRADDATZ: The administration saying it had no choice.\n\nKARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It was either no American or one American.\n\nRADDATZ: But President Biden vowing the fight for Whelans freedom will continue.\n\nBIDEN: We are not giving up.\n\nRADDATZ: All of this happening with the backdrop of Russias brutal assault on Ukraine. This week, the Donbas city of Bakhmut destroyed. Russians surrounding the city on three sides according to retired U.S. Marine Andrew Milburn of The Mozart group.\n\nANDREW MILBURN, CEO, THE MOZART GROUP: We are here to bring the last civilian out of a very dangerous place.\n\nRADDATZ: Putin admitting this week that Ukraines infrastructure is a major target.

Drones attacking deep inside Russia itself, shown here in videos circulating online.\n\nThis week Vladimir Putin saying the war might be a long process, asking for hundreds more ballistic missiles from Iran where that nation's months of protests have prompted brutal crackdowns.\n\nOn Thursday, a sickening escalation. Iran's government announced the execution by hanging of Mohsen Shekari, a 23-year-old Iranian convicted of blocking a street and attacking a member of the militia during a protest. Hundreds more are facing charges that carry the death penalty.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nRADDATZ (on camera): And joining me now is John Kirby, the National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications.\n\nGreat to see you this morning, John.\n\nJOHN KIRBY, NSC COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: Lets lets start by telling us how Brittney Griner is doing?\n\nKIRBY: Well, shes at San Antonio at the Brook Army Medical Center getting appropriate both mental health care as well as physical health care just to make sure that shes ready for her reintegration back into American society. And theyll work that out with the the doctors and the family as to how much longer shell need to be there. But our initial reports are shes in very good spirits and in good health.\n\nRADDATZ: Thats great news.\n\nSo, tell us about those final days lead leading up to her release. The U.S. acknowledged in July that it had made a substantial offer to Russia.\n\nKIRBY: Thats right.\n\nRADDATZ: You said this week to NPR, that in our minds the proposal would get both Brittney and Paul Whelan out. What does what does that mean in our minds? Was a specific offer made to the Russians, you give us Viktor Bout or well give you Viktor Bout, you give us Whelan and Griner?\n\nKIRBY: Well, without getting into the specifics of it, because we are still negotiating for Paul Whelans release, there was a very serious, specific proposal made to the Russians to try to get both of them out together and it just didnt land anywhere, didnt go anywhere with the Russians. And then as we progressed through the summer and into the fall, again, the conversation is ongoing with the Russians.\n\nIt was clear, Martha, that they were treating Paul very separately, very distinctly because of these sham espionage charges they levied against him. And then it kind of came together last week in the end game with just a Bout for Griner deal.\n\nRADDATZ: So, at what point did you lose hope that you wouldnt be getting Whelan out?\n\nKIRBY: I think it really occurred to us that there was just no chance of doing it last week.\n\nRADDATZ: Just last week?\n\nKIRBY: Just last week in terms of\n\nRADDATZ: Before that you thought there might be?\n\nKIRBY: Because weve weve been trying all the way up. All the way up until the moment where we we actually secured the deal that got Brittney home, we were still trying to get Paul out.\n\nRADDATZ: And and Paul Whelan spoke to CNN shortly after Griners release was announced. This was his message to President Biden.\n\nLets listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPAUL WHELAN, FORMER U.S. MARINE: This is a precarious situation that needs to be resolved quickly. And I would hope that he and his administration would do everything they could to get me home, regardless of the price they might have to pay at this point.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: Regardless of the price they may have to pay.\n\nYour response to that?\n\nKIRBY: Were going to keep trying as hard as we can, Martha. And theyre this business of getting wrongfully detained Americans home, theres nothing easy about it. And theres very rarely moments where its just an ah-ha, okay, God, if thats easy (ph), thats a no brainer. Its hard work. And there are tough decisions that go into it.\n\nThis was one of them too, the getting letting Mr. Bout go free six years early, that was not an easy thing to do.\n\nSo were going to keep working at this. And the president, as he has demonstrated, clearly\n\nRADDATZ: But what can you do? I mean who who else is held? I mean they wanted a German prisoner.\n\nKIRBY: There was a there was a claim that they wanted a man named named Mr. Krasikov, that the Germans have\n\nRADDATZ: Vadim Krasikov.\n\nKIRBY: -- have held in in custody, who is a an assassin. And, as I said at the time publicly, that just wasnt considered a serious offer. How can we how can we get, you know, involved in that when he hes not in our custody.\n\nRADDATZ: But are there there are people in in the U.S. who they want, Russians?\n\nKIRBY: There we again, I dont want to negotiate in public. They they hold Mr. Whelan differently because of these espionage charges. And so were working through that now. We are now more informed, clearly having gone through this process over the last few months. Were more informed. We have a better sense of the context here, where the Russias expectations are and were just going to keep working on it.\n\nRADDATZ: And and you talked about Viktor Bout. A lot of criticism.\n\nKIRBY: Yes.\n\nRADDATZ: And let me give you some more from Democratic Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Robert Menendez. We cannot ignore that releasing Bout back into the world is a deeply disturbing decision. We must stop inviting dictatorial and rogue regimes to use Americans overseas as bargaining chips.\n\nKIRBY: He would have gone free anyway in 2029. He wasnt serving a life sentence.\n\nRADDATZ: Thats a long way away.\n\nKIRBY: Its six years away. And nobodys doing back flips over there about the fact that Mr. Bout is a free man six years earlier than he would have been. But were going to protect our national security. And if Mr. Bout decides to go back to his previous line of work, then were going to do what we need to do to hold him accountable and to protect our interests.\n\nRADDATZ: Your critics just say you just werent tough enough. You have to stand up to these people to get detainees released.\n\nKIRBY: Then they I understand the criticism. They werent in the room. They werent on the phone. They werent watching the incredible effort and determination by Mr. Carstens and his team to try to get both Paul and Brittney out together. I mean, in a negotiation, you do what you can. You do as much as you can. You push and you push and you push. And we did.\n\nAnd this deal, we got last week, that was the deal that was possible. It was the deal we could get now. Now was the moment we could get it, and we executed it.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Blinken described both Griner and Whelan as political hostages. U.S. policy is to make no concessions to individuals or groups that take an American hostage. This includes denying ransoms, prisoner releases.\n\nWhy is the policy different for foreign states who detain someone for political purposes?\n\nKIRBY: These are wrongful detained Americans. And as we made clear, were going to continue to do everything we can to get them home.\n\nThe argument about encouraging hostage taking, we understand that argument, which is why the president, since he became president, has put in place accountability measures to make it harder for people to do this for political purposes, sanctions and visa restrictions.\n\nWeve also now started a new designation on the State Department website. So if an American is traveling overseas, go to that country on the website, see what the detention risk is so you go fully informed.\n\nBut know this, even if you do everything right and you go fully informed and you still make that trip and you get detained wrongfully, the United States isnt going to forget you. And if we have to make tough decisions to get you back home, then this presidents willing to do that.\n\nRADDATZ: And all of this, of course, was with the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. Give us your assessment of whats happening there now. We hard Vladimir Putin talk again about nuclear weapons, but saying I'm not crazy, I know what nuclear weapons do.\n\nWhat do you believe his state of mind is at this point in what hes looking for?\n\nKIRBY: Its difficult to know exactly what hes thinking on any given day and I -- and its a fools errand to try to get inside that brain.\n\nWhat we do is we judge him by his actions. And what we see on the ground is a man who is determined to continue to prosecute this war against the Ukraine people, indeed, to make it more about them than it is even right now about the Ukrainian armed forces. Hes hitting civilian infrastructure, knocking out the lights, knocking out the water.\n\nHes militarized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. He is trying to bring the Ukrainian people to their knees as winter approaches, which is why just Friday, we announced even more security assistance going to the Ukrainian armed forces so that they continue to win back their territory.\n\nRADDATZ: And a senior official in Zelenskyys inner circle told ABC News that it was Ukrainian drones that struck airfields deep inside Russia.\n\nIs thats something you think they should be doing?\n\nKIRBY: Ill let the Ukrainian armed forces speak for their operations. We have -- we are not certainly not encouraging or enabling Ukrainian operations inside Russia. We are trying to make sure that hey can defend their territory, win back their ground in Ukraine.\n\nAnd from the very beginning, Martha, weve talked about monitoring and being mindful of the risks of escalation of this war because thats not only not good for the Ukrainian people, its not good for our interests, its not good for the Russian people.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, thanks so much for joining us this morning, John. Always good to see you.\n\nKIRBY: You too.\n\nRADDATZ: We turn now to Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nFirst of all, thanks for standing out in the rain for us.\n\nREP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL): I can do that.\n\nRADDATZ: But, let's get right to the news.\n\nYou say we can all celebrate that Brittney Griner, whos been released. But you've been critical of the Biden administrations prisoner swap for leaving Paul Whelan behind. I know youve kept in touch with him over the years, but the administration has said this came down to no American or one American.\n\nSo, in your opinion, did the administration have an obligation to pursue a deal or should they have left Brittney Griner behind?\n\nKINZINGER: Look, I think it can be both.\n\nI think, first off, we have to be very clear -- we can celebrate Brittney being home. This isnt one or the other. This isnt, you know, we dont want her home. We're happy she's is.\n\nThe reality, though, you have to look at, obviously, Paul Whelan who has been detained for a number of years right now, about four years, and then you look at the fact that there's a guy named Marc Fogel, who is another American who was arrested a little over a year and a half ago for a small amount of marijuana possession who was given 14 years in prison.\n\nSo, I think the thing -- the reason Im critical of what this deal is, is, again, we love that Brittney's home, okay? So, let's put that aside. But why is it that Marc Fogel wasn't included?\n\nAnd also, when, you know, people say, look, it was the best deal we could get. It was the only thing the Russians were going to offer, if you make it clear that you're willing to take a deal no matter what, you're going to get a bad deal. And I think you have to negotiate from a position of strength.\n\nSo, again, we can be glad shes home and we are, but also recognize that we are changing our no-negotiation policy and that could have real ramifications in the future.\n\nRADDATZ: But even the Whelan family said that President Biden made the right choice in bringing Griner home.\n\nKINZINGER: Well, they did. They also said that we dont know what our leverage is now. They were expecting that his arms dealer was going to be the piece of leverage for -- for Paul Whelan. So, they have shown a lot of graciousness, and I think that is very good of them to do.\n\nBut I think from a policymaker perspective, we have to look at, OK, we have we have had Paul in custody for four years. Again, Marc Fogel, whos been in custody for -- I think about a year and a half ago he was arrested, 14 years in prison for a small amount of marijuana possession. The question is, where is he in these negotiations as well.\n\nSo, look, I it just as a county, weve kind of found ourselves in a point where were saying in public, were willing to trade anybody to save even just one American. What does that mean for the future? And I do worry about the implications that could have for future hostage taking if, you know, any country decides that we have somebody in our procession that they want back, they could just, obviously, arrest anybody and think that we would negotiate them away.\n\nRADDATZ: And and I want to make be clear about Marc Fogel. Apparently, theres been no determination yet on his case. Thats what we have been told. Thats why his name has not been in the news as much.\n\nYou talk about the weakness of the administration. You heard me ask John Kirby about that. Really what more can be done?\n\nKINZINGER: So, look, I'm not going to stand here and say this is an issue of weakness, this is an issue of somebody that doesnt have the strength to do it. It really is a question of, what is our policy on negotiation.\n\nAnd so, look, I mean, again, yes, it is a tough decision you have to make. But the question is, do we release a known arms dealer, somebody who still had, I heard what Mr. Kirby said about, well, he was going to be out in 2029 anyway. Thats still seven more years. That still had time that now could go back to the battlefield or could go back to the arms deal. And, you know, for what we got.\n\nLook, again, were glad shes home, but we have to recognize wide-eyed that right now, as Americans, we have made it clear that we are willing to do anything to bring a single American home. And there are people that are watching that.\n\nRADDATZ: And and, Congressman, I want to turn to the January 6th committee. You announced this week that you will release the final report on December 21st. I know you were posting a lot of materials online, but what else will we see? Will there be another public hearing?\n\nKINZINGER: So well were going to were in the process of deciding what that looks like. So well Ill I dont want to get in front of the committee in terms of announcing that. But what you will see with this report, and everything included, is a fulsome picture, right? I think we will be able to paint a very good picture over the summer with the hearings.\n\nObviously, we were limited on time. So theres a lot more material we can add, a lot more context we can add, and then we can get into a lot of areas that werent discussed in great detail.\n\nSo, that will come out on December 21st, as I think the chairman has announced or the committee has announced, whenever were going to do that, but that, for the American people, will be that full picture.\n\nAnd, look, all of this, its not about, you know, were putting anybody in jail. This is all about telling the American people about what happened and leaving with them the opportunity to say, democracies can have bad days, but how we come back from those bad days is how well be defined. And lets (ph) define ourselves very well here.\n\nRADDATZ: Got that thunder going behind you.\n\nCongressman Bennie Thompson said the committee will probably made criminal refers to the DOJ. You have previously called them pointless but symbolically important. If there are criminal referrals, and I know you dont want to get ahead of this, is it likely President Trump would be included?\n\nKINZINGER: Yes, I dont want to get too far ahead there. Ill save that for the committee decision.\n\nBut look, I dont think criminal referrals are pointless. I think the point on that is that its very clear that DOJ has decided to take this effort up. I mean theres no doubt. I dont know anything that you dont know on that. DOJ doesnt necessarily tell us what their activities are. But I think all you have to do is look out and say, theyre very interested on what happened on January 6th.\n\nSo, the criminal referrals themselves arent necessarily something that is going to wake DOJ up to something they didnt know before, but I do think it will be an important, symbolic thing that the committee can do. Even more than symbolic. Just very clear that Congress thinks, you know, a crime has been committed here or the DOJ should should investigate it.\n\nSo, only a few weeks away but, look, weve taken this job very seriously and we think the country is going to be far better off for the work that we were able to do.\n\nRADDATZ: Well, we will all be be staying tuned. Thanks very much for joining us this morning. Please, go inside. Thanks again.\n\nKINZINGER: You bet. Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: Coming up, just days after celebrating their majority, Democrats are now reeling. What Kyrsten Sinemas newfound independence will mean in the short and long term. And what it does to the balance of power in the Senate.\n\nWere back in 60 seconds.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA, (D) ARIZONA: Today's announcement is a reflection of my values and I think the values of most Arizonans, who are tired of a political system that holds people to the edges and really doesn't reflect who we are as a people. My stand today is about joining the many Americans who don't believe that any political party fits them perfectly.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema shocked Washington and her home state with that surprise announcement Friday that she will leave the Democratic Party and become an independent for the final two years of her term.\n\nSo what's the bottom line, and how will it affect the balance of power?\n\nOur political director, Rick Klein, is here to walk us through the fallout this morning.\n\nAnd, Rick, Senate Democrats went through to great lengths Friday to downplay the impact of her party switch on the Senate. After all, they say, there are already some independents serving in the Senate. But this really isn't the same.\n\nKLEIN: Yeah, Martha, Democrats are downplaying this, but it is a gut punch, with real implications for how they govern and how they campaign, particularly in the wake of this last election cycle, including the race in Georgia. The upshot of this election cycle: Democrats actually were the only party to pick up a seat over in Pennsylvania. That left them with a 51-49 majority. The two current independents, Senator Sanders and Senator King, they're essentially Democrats. They caucus with the Democrats. Democrats won't run another candidate against them. Senator Sanders is even a member of Democratic leadership. Senator Sinema, though, she is choosing a much different path.\n\nSo this is now what we're looking at, 50-49, with Senator Sinema the one independent. That means that Democrats are still technically in control. Senator Sinema says she's still going to keep her committee assignments, courtesy of Democrats. But that is the slimmest of margins. There is no wiggle room whatsoever. And it empowers someone like Senator Manchin from West Virginia to be just as influential over any legislation, anything that's happening in the Senate, as he was over the last couple of years.\n\nRADDATZ: Exactly, and, Rick, Democrats in Arizona are accusing Sinema of putting her political career before her constituents with this announcement. Are they right? And does this make her more vulnerable if she runs for re-election?\n\nKLEIN: Yeah, Martha, these are the states that are up in the next election cycle, Arizona among them. Senator Sinema has not said whether she's running for re-election. But she doesn't have to worry about a primary anymore. Flip side of that, though, is that the Democrats are already talking about taking her on. A progressive congressman, Ruben Gallego, he's already raising money to potentially challenge her. The state Democratic Party is now at war with her. They say that she's beholden to corporations and special interests.\n\nThat could set up a messy three-way race in Arizona that could easily cost Senate Democrats control of that seat. And it comes in the context of an absolutely brutal map. If you look at the states that are up, 21 out of the 34 are currently held by Democrats. That includes some very red at the presidential level states like Montana, as well as Ohio. And it also includes, as we talk about, Arizona and West Virginia.\n\nNow, like Senator Sinema, Senator Manchin hasn't said whether he's running for re-election or not. But that is a state that Donald Trump carried by almost 40 points last time around. So, look, the upshot of all of this is that Democrats are in control of the Senate, but it is a precarious majority that becomes even dicier as we get closer to the next set of elections.\n\nRADDATZ: Precarious, indeed. Thanks so much, Rick.\n\nThe other major political news this week came from Georgia, Senator Raphael Warnock defeating Herschel Walker in the Senate run-off to win a full term in Congress. It's the latest victory for Democrats in a state dominated by Republicans for decades. So is the \"Peach State\" here to stay as a political battleground?\n\nHere's FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nNATE SILVER, FOUNDER AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: There's a case to be made that Raphael Warnock really overperformed in Georgia, or, if you prefer, that Herschel Walker underperformed.\n\nThe Senate race was the only statewide race that Democrats won. GOP Governor Brian Kemp was reelected by more than 7 percentage points. And no Democrat has been elected governor of Georgia since Roy Barnes in 1998.\n\nMeanwhile Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger won by nine points last month. Republicans also won in races for lieutenant governor, attorney general, agriculture, insurance and labor commissioner, and school superintendent.\n\nSILVER: But look, while Herschel Walker was a deeply flawed candidate, lets not get too carried away here.\n\nSILVER (voiceover): But Georgia has two Democratic senators, not just Warnock but ALSO Jon Ossoff and, of course, he voted for Joe Biden for president in 2020. But these midterms werent that bad for Republicans. The GOP actually won about 3 million more votes than Democrats if you tally up all the ballots for the U.S. House.\n\nBut across the country, election-denying candidates or candidates like Walker with scandal-packed backgrounds were punished by voters especially in well-educated and diverse suburbs around cities like Atlanta.\n\nSILVER (on camera): So lets not overthink this. Yes, Georgia is still a little bit Republican-leaning, but both parties can win key races there. By definition, therefore, I buy that it's a battle ground state.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: Our thanks to Nate. And no doubt the roundtable has a thing or two to say about all of that.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(Commercial Break)\n\nRADDATZ: The Roundtable is all here, raring to go, and later, NASAs Orion spacecraft splashes down off the coast of Mexico in just a few hours. We'll talk with Mission Control in Houston coming up.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): The motion is adopted.\n\n(CHEERS)\n\nToday, Congress sends the Respect for Marriage Act to the president's desk, a glorious triumph of love and freedom. Let us salute those who legislated and advocated relentlessly to make this bill the law of the land.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMARTHA RADDATZ, ABC \"THIS WEEK\" CO-ANCHOR: Speaker Nancy Pelosi celebrating the House's historic vote to protect same-sex marriage this week. President Biden is expected to sign it into law on Tuesday. But one of the senators behind that bipartisan deal is making waves in Congress for another reason.\n\nLet's dig into that and more with our roundtable. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, our congressional correspondent Rachel Scott, and ABC News chief White House correspondent Cecilia Vega.\n\nAnd Im going to start with you and go straight to the White House, Cecilia. Let's first talk about what Rick Klein covered. Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona announcing her plans to become an independent. The White House downplaying this, no big deal, but -- come on.\n\nCECILIA VEGA, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, yeah, sort of like everything is fine, theres nothing to see here.\n\nLook, just two days before Senator Sinema decides to make this move, the press secretary was at the podium in the briefing room, saying that the Georgia win gave them all this breathing room, and they were so happy. Then, this announcement comes out and they are basically going on and on about, effusively, about what a key partner she is.\n\nLook, the reality is they've got to be nice right now. They really need her. She could end up being a reliable partner for them in Senate. She could end up being unpredictable, as she has been in the past. I think many behind the scenes would very clearly say that she's been a thorn in their legislative side.\n\nBut I think the strategy right now, at least -- at least in this first few weeks, is too, sort of kill her with kindness and keep going with this effusiveness, because they do need her at the end of the day.\n\nRADDATZ: And that killing with kindness may go on and on. But it did take some wind out of the sails of the Democrats especially after Senator Raphael Warnock winning his runoff election in Georgia. What do you think this really means for Democrats?\n\nRACHEL SCOTT, ABC NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I mean, it really sucked the air out of the room of their victory party. It felt like the confetti, it was like still dropping to the floor, and she like came in with this shock wave on Capitol Hill.\n\nI mean, two good signs for Democrats here, number one, she says she's not going to caucus with Republicans. Democrats quite frankly don't see her at caucus meetings as it is right now. It does matter less of where she lunches and more of how she votes obviously.\n\nBut also, she asked Senate Majority Leader Schumer to keep her committee assignments. And thats going to matter big for Democrats because it will allow them to retain the majority on committees, which will allow them to exercise their subpoena power, also push through judicial nominees, which is a big priority for the Biden administration. I do think this happens to be more about 2024, and sort of building up that independent coalition that shes looking for in Arizona.\n\nRADDATZ: And and, Heidi, is it more about 2024? Why do you think she did this?\n\nHEIDI HEITKAMP, (D) FORMER NORTH DAKOTA SENATOR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Its more about Arizona. Nothing theres so much pearl clutching about this decision of hers. But, at the end of the day, it means nothing.\n\nRADDATZ: Pearl clutching.\n\nHEITKAMP Pearl clutching.\n\nRADDATZ: Oh, my goodness. Look at that, the pearls.\n\nHEITKAMP: You get that, right, pearls yes, yes, you can (INAUDIBLE).\n\nRADDATZ: Welcome to our roundtable.\n\nHEITKAMP: Yes. You know, and when you look at it, at the end of the day, she always was going to vote the way she was going to vote, she always was going to be a pain in she never caucused with the Democrats. She didn't go to caucus. And and she is -- she handed them the major majority on committees. So nothing changes in this tone.\n\nWhat does change is the politics of Arizona. She is less popular in Arizona than Biden or Trump. And so she's got to find a path forward if she's going to run. That path forward was not in the Democratic caucus. The Democratic Party of of Arizona has sanctioned her. You see the animosity there over and over again. She's hoping she can get enough, you know, John McCain Republicans and conservative Democrats to form a coalition and and really frighten, I think, the the Republican the Democratic establishment from backing a Democratic candidate.\n\nRADDATZ: And and so, Chris, what, beside the obvious, is is the GOP's silver lining here? How do you look at this?\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, it just rains on, you know, the Democrats' parade. And it reminds them that even at 51-49, Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin are still the two most important United States senators out of 100. And that she wanted to make sure she reminded them, I suspect, that I'm not to be taken for granted.\n\nSo, I don't think I think that's the best thing. Otherwise, I generally agree with Heidi, I don't think that this is going to be any big deal on Capitol Hill on a day-to-day basis. Everybody's still playing their same role, you know? The rest of the folks in the Democratic caucus are going to play their role. Sinema and Manchin are going to play theirs. And the Republicans are going to play theirs and have their fights.\n\nAnd I don't think the subpoena power thing really is all that big because, in the end, who are they subpoenaing? You know, most of the time, when Congress wants to subpoena someone, its the House or the Senate, it's because other party the other party is in the White House and they want to subpoena the executive branch. So, I don't think that really is going to matter all that much either. So, I dont think its going to change much on Capitol Hill, but it allows us, as Rachel said, as they were celebrating the Raphael Warnock win, for us to say, ah, but remember, you still have Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin.\n\nRADDATZ: And and on Joe Manchin, Cecilia\n\nCECILIA VEGA, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The \"m\" word right now. Yes. Yes.\n\nRADDATZ: Yes. Yes. The \"m\" word indeed for -- for Democrats, exactly. So so what happens with him? Noting?\n\nVEGA: Well, probably at this point. I think Chris' right, I think his lane stays exactly the same. There was this whole brouhaha last year over whether he would defect, and he adamantly came out and said he wouldnt. And then in the wake of the Georgia win, there were all these headlines that perhaps this loosens his grip on power in the party. And now the headlines are, no, actually, his his hold is still the same.\n\nI think what youre going to see is that hes going to continue along the same path as he has for years and that the White House will continue to pull their hair out over him behind the scenes.\n\nCHRISTIE: Martha, Ive known Joe Manchin for a long time. He was my mentor governor when I got elected in 2009. Hes never going to be a Republican in my view.\n\nHEITKAMP (ph): No.\n\nCHRISTIE: I think Joe Manchin is a Democrat, going all the way back to his mom and dad. Its part of who he is. He's a different kind of Democrat than the Washington Democrats today. But he also showed that six years ago hes a very formidable candidate as a Democrat in a state that Donald Trump won by 40 points.\n\nSo, my guess is that Joe Manchin will just continue to be Joe Manchin. And he thinks that if he wants to run for re-election, that thats going to be good enough for him to beat any Republican that we put up any way, depending on what the atmosphere is in 24. Well see.\n\nRADDATZ: Democrats, a sigh of relief, I'm sure.\n\nHEITKAMP: I I think Joes got to decide whether he's going to run again, right?\n\nRADDATZ: Yes.\n\nHEITKAMP: So -- so that's thats the interesting thing there. He's not going to become a Republican. Hes going to continue to do what he's always done, which is speak his mind and, you know, drive deals, like the Inflation Reduction Act, which was really what a lot of Democrats ran on at the end.\n\nAnd so when you look at this, the whole dynamics of the Senate right now, it really -- when you say you don't know want theyre going to do with subpoena power, you heard what Elizabeth Warren is talking about doing, subpoenaing Jared and Ivanka to talk about the $2 billion Saudi thing. And thats a shot across the bow if youre going to go after, you know, Joe Bidens son in the House, maybe we ought to look at the deals that were done by by Jared and Ivanka when they were in the Senate in the in the White House.\n\nRADDATZ: And you may see that.\n\nHey, Rachel, I want to go back to Georgia and Herschel Walker's loss. He did worse now in this this runoff than he did in November.\n\nSCOTT: Yes. And the one thing that I was watching for\n\nRADDATZ: You were down there.\n\nSCOTT: I was down there. The one thing that I was watching for is whether or not that endorsement from Brian Kemp was going to help him in this runoff election. I mean, remember, he did worse. He underperformed where Brian Kemp was in critical districts, including around the Atlanta suburbs where Kemp, even though if he wasnt able to win a lot of those areas right outright, a lot of those counties, he did -- he was able to peel away some support, right?\n\nSCOTT: And Walker just wasn't able to do that. I thought it was interesting that, in the final stretch, he turned toward Kemp, someone that he was never seen campaigning with leading up to November, other than Donald Trump, who literally phone it in, held, like, this tele-rally.\n\nBut I talked to some of those split-ticket voters, voters that voted for Kemp and then voted for Warnock, and they said that they just felt like Walker didn't have a plan. They didn't know what he was running on. They saw him as a joke. And that was a problem.\n\nRADDATZ: Do you think he really wanted this?\n\nSCOTT: You know...\n\nRADDATZ: He had a pretty gracious concession speech.\n\nSCOTT: He did. He said that they did give it all that they had, that they gave it a fight.\n\nI think he did. I think he felt a lot of pressure, though, from Republicans, quite frankly. And Georgia just became so critical in this election. And you had the former president behind him; you had Republicans on Capitol Hill, despite all the controversies, standing behind him. But in the end, it wasn't enough.\n\nRADDATZ: And -- and. Chris, you talk a lot about quality candidates...\n\nCHRISTIE: Yeah.\n\nRADDATZ: ... the quality of the candidate.\n\nCHRISTIE: Bad candidates lose. Good candidates have a chance to win. And Herschel Walker was not a good candidate. And, you know, he wasn't a good candidate because of a whole variety of issues that we saw that came out during the campaign.\n\nLet's remember a few things. Brian Kemp won by -- had 200,000 votes more than Herschel Walker on election night. If you're Herschel Walker and you don't win that night, you're not winning. I mean, Kemp's endorsement is fine, but it's the top of the ticket in getting people to stay in that line. Brian Kemp did the best he could for Herschel Walker by beating Stacy Abrams by seven, and if Herschel Walker doesn't get 50 that night, he's not getting it.\n\nAnd on the Donald Trump side, I mean, you know, we all remember, in 2016, he said, if he got elected, there was going to be so much winning and winning and winning and winning, they'd get sick of winning. None of us knew at the time he was actually talking about the Democrats were going to do all that winning, not the Republicans. And that's what he's wrought.\n\nAnd Herschel Walker is his creation. And so he's got to own the fact that Herschel Walker so vastly underperformed in a state as -- as we saw earlier, every other Republican running statewide won, except for Herschel Walker. You know what that tells you? Bad candidate.\n\nRADDATZ: Cecilia, I want to turn to the January 6th Committee. You heard Adam Kinzinger talk about this a little. What are you expecting?\n\nVEGA: Well, we could be potentially looking at some criminal referrals in a matter of days.\n\nRADDATZ: You wouldn't go there...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRADDATZ: No surprise there.\n\nVEGA: But, I mean, there was a little bit of confusion on the Hill this past week that we will see them; we probably will see them. What our team is actually hearing is that they are looking at a number of referrals. We're looking at folks who are close to Trump. We could be talking about people like Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani, looking at charges, potentially everything from obstruction to perjury. But, look, at the end of the day, Martha, this could be ultimately a largely symbolic move. The DOJ doesn't have to act on charges referred by Congress. So I think it remains to be seen what actually happens with that.\n\nRADDATZ: And they don't have to act. But does it add pressure?\n\nHEITKAMP: Well, I think it does, but the DOJ has not demonstrated that they're really listening. There's a ton of grassroots pressure out there, \"Indict Trump, indict Trump.\" And they just methodically go through their work.\n\nAnd so, a referral, yes. I think they'll be interested in the documents, interested in the interviews. You'll see a lot of, kind of, collaboration on the information. But a referral means nothing. It doesn't mandate anything.\n\nCHRISTIE: I think it's worse than nothing, actually. I think a referral puts DOJ in a position of looking political...\n\nHEITKAMP: Yeah, that's a point.\n\nCHRISTIE: Because the committee's viewed as political. And so, if they really want some of those people to be indicted, if that's what they really think needs to happen, they should trust the attorney general to do what he thinks is right. Because the constant politicization of the Justice Department is awful for the country. And it undercuts anything that DOJ may do. Now, he's -- the attorney general's nominated, appointed, rather, a career prosecutor to run this investigation into Donald Trump. Let him do his job. And I think Congress should just stay the hell out of it, on criminal referrals. Let them write whatever report they're going to write. But criminal referrals will not put pressure on DOJ. In my view, it will make DOJ, \"We don't want to do what they asked us to do because, if we do...\"\n\nRADDATZ: Keep as far away from that as possible.\n\nCHRISTIE: Yeah.\n\nRADDATZ: Rachel, Trump's namesake company was convicted this week of tax crimes committed by two longtime executives. Donald Trump was not. So does any of this matter? It created quite a scene this week, and yet...\n\nSCOTT: Yeah, I think it adds to a long list of controversies that are plaguing the former president. I mean, if we just look at the past month alone, his hand-picked candidate in Georgia lost; he had dinner with a white supremacist, with an artist who has made Antisemitic claims. He has talked about terminating parts of the United States Constitution to help him overturn an election that he clearly lost. And now this just, sort of, adds to that, right?\n\nI mean, I think Republicans are exhausted. I mean, I think even Republicans that like the policies -- the America First policies, theyre exhausted on Capitol Hill of having to respond to controversy after controversy, not focusing on what they want to be focused on leading in 2024. And I've traveled across the country. I think, Republican voters are getting exhausted as well, even the ones that voted for him, even the ones that like him.\n\nThis opens up the door for them to consider someone else in 2024. And so I think we are seeing signs that it is starting to shatter a little bit of that Republican firewall for the former president.\n\nRADDATZ: And Cecilia, while we're on 2024, everybody better buckle up, tie it in a knot (ph), President Biden said he would think about running, we've heard him say that several times. But what are you hearing at the White House?\n\nVEGA: Yes, he's now saying that he's intending to run. I think they are in -- about to launch into full campaign mode. There's no expectation from anybody near him that he's not going to run. Theyre gearing up at this point.\n\nThe family met over the Thanksgiving break. They're going to again meet over Christmas. We're expecting some kind of announcement after the holidays. The chief of staff says he now expects that the president will run. It will happen after the holidays. You overheard -- the first lady, apparently, was overheard at the State Dinner telling Macron that she's all-in. That was a big question.\n\nBut right now, when you talk to folks around the president, theyre not feeling any pressure because of Trump to launch --\n\nRADDATZ: Okay. But --\n\nVEGA: -- to go away (ph). Yes.\n\nRADDATZ: -- we have a little longer to wait. I'm sure we'll all be holding our breaths.\n\nThanks for all of you. We got to stop now.\n\nBut up next, it's been 50 since astronauts walked on the moon. In just a few hours, the spacecraft designated to make a historic return flight will splash into the Pacific Ocean. Well check in with the director of the Johnson Space Center next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, MAY 25, 1961)\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY, THEN-U.S. PRESIDENT: I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.\n\nBut in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the moon. If we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: President John F. Kennedy's stirring speech to Congress more than 60 years ago, dared the country to send astronauts to the moon, it's been half a century since the last moon landing but a new effort is now under way.\n\nHere's Gio Benitez on NASA's new push.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: America's challenge of today has forged mans destiny of tomorrow.\n\nGIO BENITEZ, ABC NEWS TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's been 450 years since the American astronauts of Apollo 17 last step foot on the moon. NASA this week one giant leap closer to sending humankind back after Apollo's sister program Artemis successfully sent its Orion spacecraft on a nearly month-long journey, breaking the record for distance travel by a human rated spacecraft 270,000 miles from earth.\n\nHOWARD HU, ORION PROGRAM MANAGER: Its been fantastic in terms of being able to show where our spacecraft is and taking a few pictures to tell the audience how wonderful it is to be so far from earth.\n\nBENITEZ: Pictures like this, Orion selfie with the moon and earth, a flashback to this iconic photo known as blue marble.\n\nLike Apollo 17 splashdown 50 years ago, Orion slated to do the same off the coast of Baja in just a few hours. Flight engineers are attempting a so-called skip entry, where the spacecraft traveling at 25,000 miles per hour will hit earth's atmosphere, skip like a rock off of it back into space, and re-enter to splash down at a precise target.\n\nThe maneuver will help NASA protect astronauts returning to earth by minimizing recovery time.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We rise together back to the moon and beyond.\n\nBENITEZ: If all goes well, the next flight planned Artemis II in 2024 would include astronauts orbiting the moon and Artemis III tentatively slated for 2025 would fulfill NASAs goal of putting a woman and a person of color on the surface of the moon.\n\nVictor Glover is an astronaut hoping to be assigned to an Artemis mission.\n\nVICTOR GLOVER, ARTEMIS ASTRONAUT: When humans do great things, we call them moonshots. And now, our generation has a moonshot. Its a really exciting time.\n\nBENITEZ: As NASA moves forward with the Artemis program, a new space race is emerging, a Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa announced this week a crew of eight astronauts to go to the moon with him optimistically next year.\n\nYears from now, how far do you hope Orion will go?\n\nHU: Well, you know, Orion is a very important of our overall transportation infrastructure. So, it will carry as far as we hope we need to go and certainly the moon is the first step, and we always talk about beyond.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nRADDATZ: And our thanks to Gio for that.\n\nJoining me now is the director of NASAs Johnson Space Center overseeing the Artemis Mission, Vanessa Wyche.\n\nIts great to see you this morning. A very exciting day for all of you.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft is set to splashdown in just a couple of hours. What do you learn from that mission? VANESSA WYCHE, NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER DIRECTOR: Well, you know, this is the first flight. This is a test flight. And it's uncrewed. So, we don't have any crew members onboard, but we're learning how does this spacecraft operate in deep space?\n\nSo, right now, today, we're ending the phases of on-orbit flight and we're going to be re-entering. So, we already learned a lot about how it operates in an environment that is providing us radiation that's different, the temperatures that we're seeing, et cetera. So, now, we're going to be re-entering, and we're going to see how the heat shield is going to perform as we re-enter into the Earth's atmosphere and were going to see how our parachutes hold up so that we can land safely.\n\nNow, with this particular spacecraft, now we're going to be able to on our next launch to put our crew members onboard. So, this is a huge day for us today.\n\nRADDATZ: It sure is. What's the importance of going to the moon again after 50 years?\n\nWYCHE: Yes. So, after fifty years, now were going to be going and were going to be going differently. Were going to go and were going to go in a stainable way, because what we're trying to do is understand what it's like to live on another planetary body before we go onto Mars. So this is critical. Its critical for us in terms of understanding scientific discoveries. You think about the technologies that we had in the late '60s, early '70s, when we went to the moon before under Apollo. But this time when we go, we have different technologies and well be able to discover more, as well as we're going to be going with our international partners and our commercial partners. And our commercial partners are very interested as well in how they can explore and maybe mine for resources that we did not be able to do under Apollo.\n\nRADDATZ: And the Artemis III mission in 2025 is expected to include the first woman or the first person of color, or both. Why is that so important?\n\nWYCHE: It's so very important. So, under Apollo, you know, we had men that went to the moon because at that time that was what our space program was made of. But today our space program is so much more diverse. And so our astronaut core, we have women, we have men, we have people of color, and we also this time will be going with an international component and crew as well. And so it's very important because now we'll be going with everyone. Everyone from earth will be going to the moon.\n\nRADDATZ: That -- that's a very exciting thing.\n\nAnd -- and and just quickly, I know the Japanese a Japanese billionaire says he plans to fly a crew to the moon. Will they beat us?\n\nWYCHE: Well, they're going to be doing a test flight as well because they'll be going maybe on one of the early SpaceX missions. So, we shall see. Right now, today, they're theyre doing plans and working towards that. And NASA, we will be preparing our astronauts and we will be launching.\n\nRADDATZ: OK. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Great to see you.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(COMERCIAL CREAK)\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us.

Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nORHEI, Moldova Starved of natural gas from Russia and electricity from Ukraines missile-battered power grid, Moldova has been so unsettled by skyrocketing utility bills and occasional blackouts that, according to the mayor of a small city in the north, residents can barely contain their anger.\n\n\"They stop me on the street and ask: When can we go to another protest?\" said the mayor, Pavel Verejanu, of Orhei, describing what he called public fury at the pro-Western central government and its failure to secure a deal with Russia for a steady supply of cheap energy.\n\nBut there is another reason people are so eager to protest: They are paid to join the noisy weekly rallies that have been held since September in the capital, Chisinau, calling for the removal of Moldovas president, Maia Sandu, a former World Bank official pushing Europes poorest country out of Moscows orbit.\n\nThe paid protests against the president and her westward tilt are organized by the mayors political party, a vociferously pro-Russian force led by his predecessor, Ilan M. Shor, a convicted fraudster and fugitive who, officials say, is working to turn an energy crisis into a political crisis that threatens the government.\n\nAnger at high energy prices has been bubbling across Europe for months, offering Moscow what it sees as its best hope of eroding public support for Ukraine and pressuring Western governments to back away from their condemnations of Russias invasion.\n\nRussia-friendly activists on the far left and far right have helped mobilize protests over high energy prices in the Czech Republic, Germany and other European countries. But those demonstrations have been less frequent and far less well-funded than the weekly rallies and often daily flash mob protests in Moldova, a country that is particularly vulnerable because of its longstanding political, economic and linguistic cleavages.\n\nImage An antigovernment demonstration in Chisinau in November, by people who are angry at high energy prices and blame the government.

Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nRussia has not only created public discontent in Moldova through a squeeze on energy supplies, but, working through local allies like Mr. Shor, has also pushed this discontent onto the streets, trying to unseat the pro-Western government.\n\n\"It is obvious these things are all connected,\" said Moldovas foreign minister, Nicu Popescu. The energy crisis, he added in an interview, is \"very, very serious,\" and \"it is legitimate for a lot of people to feel unhappy.\"\n\nBut he scorned Mr. Shors role in organizing and bankrolling protests as \"an attempt to manipulate and ride the negative effects of the war in Ukraine.\" The result, he said: An energy crunch engineered by Russia and exploited by groups that \"openly support Russia\" to \"destabilize the government.\"\n\nA tiny but strategically important country sandwiched between Romania a member of NATO and the European Union and Ukraine, Moldova has been caught since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, of which it was a part, in an intense geopolitical tug of war between East and West.\n\nLocal politicians backed by either Moscow or Washington and the European Union have traded power in a long series of unstable governments in Chisinau. Mr. Shors party won just six of 101 seats in Parliament in elections last year, while Ms. Sandus party won a big majority over those seeking close relations with Moscow.\n\nImage Elena Lungu lighting a wood-burning stove this month in a village outside Orhei, Moldova.

Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nRussias February invasion of neighboring Ukraine pushed this perennial struggle into a tumultuous new phase.\n\nIt sent shock waves and, on at least two occasions, missiles crashing onto Moldovan territory. The missiles, the second of which was found on Monday, landed in northern Moldova near the border with Ukraine, further rattling a fragile country already grappling with inflation of nearly 35 percent. Gas prices in Moldova have increased sevenfold and electricity prices have increased fourfold in the past 12 months, Ms. Sandu, the countrys president, told CNN on Saturday.\n\nThough not a direct party to the war, Moldova, whose Constitution commits it to neutrality, has felt Russias fury through sharp cuts in energy supplies.\n\n\"Russias objective is clear,\" said Andrei Spinu, a deputy prime minister in charge of Moldovas frantic efforts to patch together alternative supplies of electricity and gas. \"They want to change our government, and change our geopolitical choice toward Europe,\" he said, sitting in a gloomy office in central Chisinau lit only by thin winter light coming through the windows.\n\nAll the lights in his office have been turned off to save electricity. He uses a cellphone flashlight to navigate the darkened corridors of the main government building. Russian missile strikes on Ukraines power grid, which used to provide Moldova with a vital backup source of electricity, left the whole country without power late last month.\n\nImage Gas pipes in Curchi, in Orhei County. Electricity and gas prices have more than doubled in Moldova. Credit... Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nThe wide boulevard outside his office has been a frequent site of the protests organized by the Shor Party. Its leader, Mr. Shor, directs them from his refuge in Israel. He finances the demonstrations and speaks by video link to each gathering chanting for Ms. Sandus removal.\n\nWarning of a \"tough winter\" ahead without Russian gas, Mr. Shor recently used his Facebook page to call on supporters to \"come out en masse\" for street protests. \"We must do everything we can to get rid of this incompetent government and hold early elections.\"\n\nHe did not respond to requests for an interview through his spokesperson.\n\nIn October, the United States imposed sanctions on Mr. Shor, his Russian pop-star wife and seven others for involvement in \"persistent malign influence campaigns\" by Russia in Moldova.\n\nThat same month, the police conducted nighttime raids on 55 offices, vehicles and residences connected to him and his party. Investigators seized 20 black plastic shopping bags stuffed with local currency worth $89,000, which prosecutors say represented a weeks outlay on protests and other activities aimed at unseating the government.\n\n\"A lot of effort and money has been put into destabilizing the situation in our country,\" Veronica Dragalin, Moldovas anticorruption prosecutor, said in an interview.\n\nMany people, including American officials, suspect that some of the Shor Partys cash comes from Russia, which would be illegal, but Mr. Shor has denied it. He has also appealed his 2017 conviction and seven-and a-half-year sentence over his role in the theft of nearly a billion dollars from Moldovan banks, insisting he is the victim of a corrupt justice system.\n\nImage \"A lot of effort and money has been put into destabilizing the situation in our country,\" said Veronica Dragalin, Moldovas anticorruption prosecutor. Credit... Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nPaying people to protest is not illegal. But by amplifying genuine discontent it creates an impression that the country is falling apart a message, analysts say, that has been promoted with glee by Russian news outlets.\n\nMr. Shors party also routinely exaggerates the size of its protests, claiming, for example, that 45,000 showed up last week outside the prosecutor generals office. The real number was a few thousand.\n\nThe spectacle of a political partys echoing Kremlin talking points on the war and organizing paid protests over an energy crisis generated by Russia illustrates one of Moscows favorite tactics for asserting its influence across the former Soviet Union: Stoke a crisis and then, either directly or through local proxies, offer a solution that requires acceptance of Russian hegemony.\n\nThe pattern first played out three decades ago when, just months after the collapse of the Soviet Union, ethnic Russian separatists in the Transnistria region of eastern Moldova took up arms against the government of the newly independent nation. Moscow vowed to quell the violence and sent in troops, allowing Transnistria to operate ever since as a quasi-state haven for Russian influence and black market trade.\n\nImage Soldiers in Tiraspol, Transnistria, in May. Russias military presence in Transnistria, a territory that broke away from Moldova in 1992, consists primarily of ill-trained local recruits. Credit... Cristian Movila for The New York Times\n\nThe pattern repeated in 2014 in eastern Ukraine, where Russia stoked an armed rebellion against the central government in Kyiv, and then offered to help curb the mayhem provided that Ukraine accept terms entrenching Moscows influence. After that failed, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered a full-scale invasion in February.\n\nWith Russian troops flailing in Ukraine, nobody expects the Kremlin to send its battered military into Moldova any time soon. A small Russian force remains in Transnistria, but most of the troops are ill-trained local recruits, and they are sorely underequipped. Ukraine closed its borders with Transnistria at the start of the war, severing supply lines.\n\nIts military options limited, Moscow has instead hammered Moldova with its energy weapon, delivering less than half the natural gas stipulated in contracts.\n\nMany supporters of Mr. Shor, the fugitive millionaire, in Orhei, where he served as mayor for four years before fleeing to Israel in 2019, acknowledge that he may be a crook.\n\nBut pointing to his tenure as mayor, when he built sidewalks, installed lights and improved Orhei markedly, they see him as a Robin Hood figure whose wealth, no matter its source, will bring benefits to ordinary people.\n\nImage A Christmas tree in early December in the center of Orhei, where many supporters of the fugitive politician Ilan M. Shor acknowledge that he may be corrupt, but point to improvements he made as mayor. Credit... Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nHis other big selling point is that, unlike the current government, he has close ties with Russia and can use them to end the energy crunch.\n\nIndeed, soon after Russias energy behemoth, Gazprom, began cutting gas deliveries to Moldova in the fall, a move that threatened a long, cold winter ahead, Mr. Shor criticized Ms. Sandu for \"bowing to the West.\" And he sent several of his partys legislators to Moscow to find \"solutions to provide the Republic of Moldova with natural gas this winter at affordable prices,\" the party said in a statement.\n\nMr. Shor claimed that Russia would soon start providing cheap gas to the region around Orhei. That never happened, not least because delivering Russian gas only to Orhei is technically and legally impossible.\n\nThousands of protesters have, nonetheless, gathered every week since in support of his appeal for better relations with Russia.\n\nImage Pavel Verejanu, the current mayor of Orhei, acknowledges that some antigovernment protesters are paid. Credit... Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nMr. Shor recently acknowledged paying protesters after an independent Moldovan newspaper, Ziarul de Garda, published an investigation written by journalists who had posed as protesters and received money.\n\nMr. Verejanu, the mayor of Orhei, said no more than half the protesters were paid, and only those too poor to buy food and drink during the trip to and from Chisinau.\n\nAt a Shor Party rally last week outside the prosecutor generals office, protesters blocked the main boulevard and denounced the president and government ministers as corrupt thieves blind to peoples economic pain.\n\nMaria Muntiu, 80, insisted she had not been paid to attend and had come out because she wanted to express her anger at being unable to afford heating.\n\nMoldova, she said, needs a \"real president like Putin\" who will put the countrys interests ahead of \"geopolitical games by America\" and provide cheap energy. Ms. Sandu, she said, \"is trying to freeze us into silence.\"",

                "cc_text": "WASHINGTON Month after month, as American diplomats pushed for the release of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan from Russian prisons, they received the same, infuriating answer: If you want both prisoners, we want Vadim Krasikov as part of the deal.\n\nMr. Krasikov is an assassin who murdered a Chechen fighter in a park in Berlin in broad daylight in 2019, a brazen killing that the German authorities say was committed at the behest of Russias intelligence services. Convicted and sentenced to life in prison in Germany, Mr. Krasikov was not in U.S. custody to be traded to Russia.\n\nIt was, the Americans thought, hardly a viable request for a swap that would include Ms. Griner, a W.N.B.A. star, and Mr. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, who were being detained on what Biden administration officials considered trumped-up charges. American officials felt out their German counterparts to see if they might agree and were hardly surprised when Berlin refused to release what they considered a cold killer. Trying to be creative, the Americans even explored some sort of three-way deal that would give the Germans something in return, but that did not go anywhere, either.\n\nPrivately, some of the administrations diplomats concluded that the insistence on freeing Mr. Krasikov was a stalling tactic by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who they believed was determined not to deliver any kind of political victory to President Biden before the midterm elections in the United States last month. Others believed the Russians were serious and saw it as a face-saving way for Moscows security services to give up Mr. Whelan, whom they convicted of espionage despite flat denials from Washington that he was a spy.\n\nEither way, how Mr. Biden came to agree to a swap that freed Ms. Griner but not Mr. Whelan was a tale of feints and intrigue carried out through secret negotiations and public posturing, all against the backdrop of a brutal war in which American-armed Ukrainians were battling Russian invaders. At the end of the day, according to senior U.S. officials directly involved in the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe delicate diplomacy, it left the president with the unpalatable choice of liberating one American while leaving another behind.\n\nMs. Griner arrived in the United States early Friday, landing in San Antonio, where she was to receive medical evaluations at Brooke Army Medical Center and be reunited with family, a relief for Mr. Biden and his team. Mr. Whelan remains in a dismal Russian prison, his long-term fate unknown, as his frustrated family waits and while the president vows to redouble efforts to bring him home.\n\nIn Moscow on Friday, Mr. Putin said Russia was continuing to communicate with American officials and that \"everything is possible\" regarding further prisoner exchanges. American officials have delivered a similar message, pledging to continue talks in the hope of bringing Mr. Whelan home as soon as possible.\n\nThe two imprisoned Americans offered distinct cases that were eventually linked and then unlinked. Ms. Griner, detained on minor drug charges a week before Russias invasion of Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, was seen as a hostage in the midst of the confrontation with the West over the conflict. Mr. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, had been in prison since 2018 on espionage charges long before the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe outlines of a possible agreement were on the table as far back as last spring. Interacting through intelligence agencies, the Russians made clear that they were willing to trade Ms. Griner for Viktor Bout, a notorious Russian arms dealer arrested in Thailand in 2008 and serving a 25-year sentence in American prison. But they were not willing to include Mr. Whelan in the package deal.\n\nMr. Bout was important to the Russians because of his ties to the security services. While he is not known to be close to Mr. Putin, U.S. officials said, Mr. Bout has connections in the Russian power structures. And Russia had made a martyr out of Mr. Bout over the past 14 years; freeing him would allow Mr. Putin to boast about finally bringing a patriot home.\n\nTo the Russians, trading Ms. Griner for Mr. Bout was a swap of two criminals, according to U.S. officials. Mr. Whelan, on the other hand, was supposedly an American agent, in the Russian telling, so only another agent or someone of equivalent importance would merit giving him up. The Americans do not currently have a Russian spy in custody to trade. And that is where Mr. Krasikov came in.\n\nMr. Krasikov, who called himself Vadim A. Sokolov, was arrested after two witnesses saw him throwing his bike and a bag into the Spree River after twice shooting the victim, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a Chechen separatist commander who fought against Russian forces in the early 2000s and was labeled a terrorist by Russian state media. Police divers later found a Glock 26 pistol in the river in the downtown park.\n\nFrustrated by the demand for a swap they could not make, American officials broke with years of tradition by telling reporters that they had made a \"substantial\" offer to the Russians, making clear that Mr. Biden would trade Mr. Bout for Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan. They hoped the public pressure would move the Russians off their insistence for Mr. Krasikov and into a deal.\n\nIt did not for many months.\n\nBut just after Election Day in the United States, Russian contacts delivered a new message, raising the possibility of excluding Mr. Whelan from a deal and instead focusing exclusively on Ms. Griner. If that were the case, the Russians said, Moscow might consider Mr. Bout a fair trade.\n\nThe disparity of their offenses was vast: Mr. Bout was an illegal arms merchant to some of the worlds most violent forces, including some intent on killing Americans; Ms. Griner was detained for traveling with vape cartridges containing hashish oil. But it was the first time that the Russians had made what the American diplomats considered a real counteroffer, if they were serious about following through.\n\nAt the White House, the possibility prompted a series of high-level meetings and discussions, some of which included Mr. Biden, about whether to test if the Russians were serious about making a one-for-one deal, much like they had months before in a swap that freed Trevor Reed, another imprisoned American.\n\nThe situation was fluid and uncertain. Even as they discussed their options, the family of Mr. Whelan said publicly that he had missed two calls with them, raising fears for his safety and reports that he had been moved from his prison to a hospital in Russia.\n\nHad the Russians done something to Mr. Whelan? That could have made a trade for Ms. Griner impossible, but also would have seemed unlikely given that it was the Russians who now seemed eager to make a deal. For days, work on the potential deal for Ms. Griner stalled as the Americans worked to figure out what had happened. Officials eventually determined that Mr. Whelan had been taken back to prison, and he called his family.\n\nAt a meeting in the Oval Office early last week, Mr. Biden was ready to sign off. The Justice Department had weighed in against the deal, communicating their objections through Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. But the department makes a policy of opposing prisoner trades across the board, arguing that it undercuts the American justice system. The State Department, on the other hand, recommended the deal, as did other officials who concluded that the deal from the Russians was never going to change and so it was time to take it. The president agreed.\n\nThe careful negotiations, however, almost unraveled a few days later, as Mr. Biden hosted President Emmanuel Macron of France for a state dinner at the White House. A journalist for CBS News contacted the White House with reporting that the administration was preparing to swap Ms. Griner for Mr. Bout.\n\nPremature disclosure, officials feared, was likely to scuttle the deal. They asked the network to hold off. According to CBS, it \"agreed to a White House request to hold the reporting because officials expressed grave concern about the fragility of the then-emerging deal.\"\n\nWith that resolved, officials moved forward. Armed with the presidents go-ahead, they pressed their Russian counterparts: Are you serious about this? The answer came back more quickly than the American diplomats expected, and it was more definitive. Yes, they said. The day after the state dinner, Mr. Biden signed an executive grant of clemency for Mr. Bout, but held it back while aides set the transfer in motion.\n\nWary of undercutting the deal, the American diplomats carefully made one last appeal for Mr. Whelan, asking the Russians if there was anyone other than Mr. Krasikov whom they might want in exchange for both Mr. Whelan and Ms. Griner. They got a firm no, but the Russians did not use the effort as an excuse to back out of the developing arrangement for Ms. Griner.\n\nWithin days, plans were set for two planes to take off one from Moscow, where Ms. Griner had been transferred, and another from the United States, with Mr. Bout.\n\nOne question to resolve: Where to make the swap? In the Cold War days and even as recently as a Russian-American spy swap in 2010 under President Barack Obama, prisoners were exchanged in the middle of Europe: the Glienicke Bridge in Potsdam, Germany, as made famous in the Tom Hanks movie \"Bridge of Spies,\" or in Vienna, as with the 2010 trade.\n\nBut because of American and European sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in February, Moscow was not willing to send a plane anywhere in Europe for fear that it could be seized. Even long-neutral Switzerland had joined sanctions against Russia while Helsinki, Finland a prime Russian-American meeting site during the Cold War was no longer acceptable because the country is joining NATO.\n\nThe compromise became the United Arab Emirates, a small Gulf state that is friendly with both Washington and Moscow. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the president of the Emirates, had raised Ms. Griners case with Mr. Putin during a meeting in October, and so the Emiratis were happy to facilitate the transfer. The arrangements were made: Both sides would send planes to Abu Dhabi, the capital.\n\nCherelle Griner, Ms. Griners wife, was invited to the White House on Thursday morning ostensibly to meet with Mr. Sullivan for an update. When she arrived, however, Mr. Sullivan surprised her by taking her to the Oval Office, where Mr. Biden broke the news that Ms. Griner was coming home. At that point, Ms. Griner was on the ground in Abu Dhabi, while Mr. Bouts plane was 30 minutes out.\n\nOnce he landed, his clemency document was finalized and the swap proceeded, captured in grainy video distributed by Russian state media. It showed Ms. Griner and Mr. Bout being walked to the middle of a dusty tarmac, escorted by officials of their countries. After a brief stop, Ms. Griner was led away in one direction, while Mr. Bout left with Russian officials in another.\n\nMr. Biden and Cherelle Griner celebrated before cameras in the Oval Office. But once the journalists were ushered out, the president had another, grimmer task: He had to call Mr. Whelans sister to explain why he was not coming home, at least not yet.\n\nNeil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Paris, and Anton Troianovski from Moscow.",

According to the head of U.S. intelligence, the war is running at a \"reduced tempo.\" Meanwhile, a Kremlin official defended Russias repeated strikes against Ukraines crucial energy facilities, which the civilian population needs to stay warm this winter. Here are the latest developments.\n\nPutin more informed about military difficulties, says intelligence chief\n\nThe U.S. director of national intelligence said on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has become \"more informed\" about the challenges the military is facing. Speaking at a defense forum, Avril Haines indicated that the Kremlin leader was no longer shielded from negative information about Russias standing in the war. Haines also stated that the conflict seemed to be operating at a \"reduced tempo\" as both sides resupply for a possible spring counteroffensive.\n\nMassive missile attack launched in Ukraine\n\nUkrainian officials said Monday that Russias military had begun a missile attack across the country. The deputy head of the presidents office said that two buildings had been hit in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, killing two people and injuring three others, including a small child. Air raid sirens sounded in cities such as Kyiv, where locals were forced to take shelter in the underground subway system. Ukrenergo, Ukraines energy provider, said its facilities had been struck, causing blackouts amid \"the eighth massive missile attack by a terrorist country.\"\n\nExplosions at Russian military bases\n\nRussian state-linked media outlets reported Monday that two explosions had occurred at air bases in Russia. According to Astra, two aircraft were destroyed and two soldiers were injured and hospitalized after a drone attack. One of the strikes occurred at the Engels-2 air base, located hundreds of miles from Russias border with Ukraine, the New York Times reported. The other, according to RIA Novosti, happened in an airfield near Ryazan when a fuel truck exploded.

Speaking in an interview with French media on Saturday, Macron said Europe should prepare a \"dialogue\" for both Russian and Ukrainian officials to \"return to the table.\"\n\n\"One of the essential points we must address, as President Putin has always said, is the fear that NATO comes right up to its doors, and the deployment of weapons that could threaten Russia,\" Macron said.

At the start of the war, Russia was operating as many as 300 missions per day; now it is conducting \"significantly\" fewer. \"The decrease in sorties is likely a result of continued high threat from Ukrainian air defences, limitations on the flying hours available to Russian aircraft, and worsening weather,\" the Defense Ministry tweeted. \"With Russias ground attack tactics largely reliant on visual identification and unguided munitions, the Russian air force will likely continue a low rate of ground attack operations through the poor winter weather.\"",

The governor said an oil storage tank had gone up in flames, but there were no casualties.\n\nOn Monday, Russia said it had been hit hundreds of kilometres from Ukraine by what it said were Soviet-era drones - at Engels air base, home to Russia's strategic bomber fleet, and in Ryazan, a few hours' drive from Moscow.\n\nUkraine did not directly claim responsibility for the strikes, but nonetheless celebrated them.\n\nIn Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Tuesday, \"We are not enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. We are not encouraging Ukraine to strike beyond its borders.\"\n\nHe added that there was no confirmation the strikes were carried out by Ukraine.\n\nPrice said the United States has not provided Ukraine with weapons that are to be used within Russia.\n\n\"We have been very clear that these are defensive supplies,\" Price said.\n\n'SMOKING'\n\nRussia's defence ministry said three service members were killed in the attack at Ryazan. Although the attacks struck military targets, it characterised them as terrorism and said the aim was to disable its long-range aircraft.\n\nThe New York Times, citing a senior Ukrainian official, said the drones involved in Monday's attacks were launched from Ukrainian territory, and at least one of the strikes was carried out with the help of special forces close to the base.\n\nUkraine never publicly acknowledges responsibility for attacks inside Russia. Asked about the strikes, Defence Minister Oleskiy Reznikov repeated a longstanding joke blaming carelessness with cigarettes. \"Very often Russians smoke in places where it's forbidden to smoke,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych went further, noting that Engels is Russia's only base fully equipped for the fleet of huge bombers Moscow has used to attack Ukraine.\n\n\"They will try to disperse (strategic aircraft) to airfields, but all this complicates the operation against Ukraine. Yesterday, thanks to their 'unsuccessful smoking', we achieved a very big result,\" he said.\n\nThe damage to the warplanes also caused grumbling among Russian military bloggers, whose social media posts can provide a window into the mood in Russia on the course of the war, which began more than nine months ago with Russian forces invading Ukraine.\n\n[1/2]A satellite image shows bomber in flight at northeast of Engels Air Base in Saratov, Russia, December 3, 2022. Satellite image 2022 Maxar Technologies/Handout via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights\n\n\"And I, a naive civilian fool, thought that planes were kept under concrete shelters during war, no?\" wrote Vladlen Tatarsky. \"It turns out that small drones, the danger from which was so neglected, can attack strategic aircraft.\"\n\nNEW BARRAGE\n\nThe huge Tupolev long-range bombers that Russia stations at Engels form a big part of its strategic nuclear arsenal, similar to the B-52s deployed by the United States during the Cold War. Russia has used them in its campaign since October to destroy Ukraine's energy grid with near weekly waves of missile strikes.\n\nThe Engels base, near the city of Saratov, is at least 600 km (372 miles) from the nearest Ukrainian territory.\n\nRussia responded to Monday's attacks with what it called a \"massive strike on Ukraine's military control system\", though it did not identify any specific military targets for what Ukraine called Moscow's latest strikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nMoscow claims military justification for attacks on Ukraine's civil infrastructure. Kyiv says the strikes are intended to hurt civilians, a war crime.\n\nMissiles across Ukraine destroyed homes and knocked out power, but the impact seemed less severe than barrages last month that pitched millions of Ukrainians into darkness and cold.\n\nMeanwhile on the battlefields of eastern, northeastern and southern Ukraine, Russian forces kept up their shelling of towns and villages, the Ukrainian military said in its Tuesday evening report.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zelenskiy visited troops in the eastern Donbas region that has seen the war's heaviest fighting.\n\nHe praised soldiers in a selfie video filmed in front of a sign on the road outside Sloviansk, near the city of Bakhmut that Russian forces have been trying to encircle for weeks. He also presented medals and shook hands with troops in a hangar.\n\nRESISTANCE\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the U.S. deputy secretary of state said Russia must remove all its troops from Ukraine.\n\nWendy Sherman, speaking at an event in Rome, said the United States had sufficient arms stockpiles to keep helping Ukraine, and that Western states backing Kyiv must \"stay the course\".\n\nNo political talks are under way to end the war. Moscow insists it will not negotiate unless Kyiv and the West accept its sovereignty over Ukrainian lands it claims, while Kyiv says Russia must leave all its territory.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday talks would only be possible when Russia achieves the goals of its \"special military operation\", which he did not define.\n\nReporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Peter Graff, Angus MacSwan and Grant McCool; Editing by Gareth Jones, Mark Heinrich and Cynthia Osterman\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The persistent shelling of the Nikopol district raises concerns due to the potential risk it poses to the nearby nuclear facility, which if damaged, could lead to a serious nuclear incident (1,3). Moreover, the area's significance is underscored by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who, while not referring to Nikopol directly, has hailed the annexation of Ukrainian territories around the Sea of Azov, emphasizing the strategic gains for Russia (4).",

The shelling incidents have not only resulted in physical destruction but have also heightened concerns over the safety and security of the nuclear facility, as Russia is accused of using the plant for military purposes and storing weapons near the plant's nuclear material (7).\n\nMoreover, the strategic location of the Nikopol district has made it a target for bombardments aimed at the opposite bank of the Dnieper River, which suggests that Russia may be utilizing the cover provided by the nuclear power plant's infrastructure to conduct military operations (7). The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant itself has been a point of contention, with Ukrainian officials accusing Russia of transforming the plant into a weapons depot and the illegal transfer of plant operations and employees to a Russian state corporation (10). The situation underscores the broader risks and complexities introduced by the presence of nuclear facilities in a warzone, particularly when they become intertwined with military objectives (7,10)."

Reports confirm that the shelling has resulted in civilian injuries, with at least four people hurt in Nikopol (3), and has caused substantial damage to power lines, homes, and other buildings (7,9). The consistent targeting of the area and the intensity of the shelling suggest a deliberate strategy to exert pressure on this strategically significant region of Ukraine, as it sits opposite the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, underscoring the potential for broader implications on regional security due to the proximity to a critical energy facility (1,7,9)."

The safety of the plant is further compromised by Russia's placement of Grad rocket launchers near the facility's spent nuclear fuel storage, posing a risk of shelling across the Dnieper River and using the plant as cover, which violates nuclear safety regulations (3). Shelling in the surrounding areas, like Nikopol and Chervonohryhorivka, has damaged residential buildings and power lines, indicating the broader impact of military actions near the plant (2). Additionally, the persistent targeting of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure by Russia, which has included the Zaporizhzhia plant's region, exacerbates the risk to the nuclear facility (4,5).",
                "more_detailed": "The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently operational and connected to the Ukrainian grid, faces significant challenges to its safety and operational status due to ongoing hostilities. Shelling has previously damaged transmission lines, forcing the plant to rely on diesel generators to maintain its critical cooling systems, which are designed only for temporary backup. This reliance on generators poses a risk of meltdown should the connection to the grid be severed again, increasing the burden on the plant's operators and potentially overstretching the generators (1). Moreover, the presence of Russian military hardware, including Grad rocket launchers positioned dangerously close to the plant's spent nuclear fuel storage, compounds the risks by potentially violating nuclear and radiation safety regulations and escalating the chance of a catastrophic incident (3).\n\nThe shelling has had broader implications for the surrounding areas as well, with attacks damaging residential buildings, power lines, and critical infrastructure near the plant. In the Zaporizhzhia region, shelling has affected the communities of Nikopol and Chervonohryhorivka, leading to power outages and damage to more than 10 houses (2,6,7). The continuous targeting of civilian infrastructure by Russian forces, which includes the Zaporizhzhia plant, is part of a broader strategy that has been condemned by Ukraine and the West. This strategy appears aimed at reducing morale, causing civilian suffering during winter, and pressuring the Ukrainian government (4,5). The operational challenges at the Zaporizhzhia plant thus reflect both a direct threat to nuclear safety and a component of the wider conflict's impact on Ukraine's civilian population and infrastructure (1,3,4,5)."

However, the broader economic impact on Ukraine includes the destruction of critical infrastructure such as roads, railways, and transportation networks, estimated to surpass $31bn, which indicates the extensive financial strain the country faces due to the conflict (4). The damage to the transportation infrastructure alone hinders logistics and trade, crucial for the economic stability of regions like Nikopol. This destruction is part of a wider Russian strategy to diminish morale and put pressure on the Ukrainian government by targeting essential services and the combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces (6)."

However, the increased number of Russian troops in the Zaporizhzhia region following their withdrawal from Kherson has led to intensified shelling in the area (2).

The Russian military has positioned their artillery units around the nuclear facility, which has complicated the Ukrainian military's response options. Ukrainian forces have expressed that they cannot return fire due to the risk of triggering a nuclear disaster, which has led to a significant change in their defensive posture in the region (1,4). As a result, the population of Nikopol has decreased by more than half since the onset of hostilities, as residents flee the constant shelling and the threat of a nuclear incident (1).\n\nDespite the shelling, there have been no reports of the Ukrainian military altering their offensive posture in the area. The Ukrainian forces continue to hold their positions, enduring \"from evening till morning\" shelling attacks from Russian forces stationed at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (4). While the region has seen an increase in Russian force density, and shelling has intensified, the Ukrainian military appears to maintain its current strategy without engaging in actions that could escalate the situation around the nuclear plant (2,4,5,6). Additionally, Ukrainian public opinion remains steadfast in the face of bombardment, with a survey indicating a strong resolve to continue fighting, which likely influences the military's continued defense efforts without a shift in offensive actions (3)."

Following Russias retreat from the city of Kherson the only regional capital captured by Moscow since the start of Russian President Vladimir Putins invasion Ukrainian forces have limited options for their next big push to continue recapturing occupied territory and, ultimately, to expel the invaders.\n\nMuch attention is now shifting here, to the southern front line less than 100 miles north of the Sea of Azov, where Ukrainians are eager to sever the \"land bridge\" connecting mainland Russia to Crimea, which Russia invaded and illegally annexed in 2014. Kyiv is also intent on liberating cities such as Melitopol and Enerhodar, where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian forces, in turn, are digging into more fortified defensive positions, clearly anticipating a fight.\n\n\"Everyone is talking about Zaporizhzhia.

Instead, there was a surprise, lightning push in the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nFor now, Ukrainian soldiers in the Zaporizhzhia region appear to be in a bit of a waiting mode waiting, in muddy conditions, for the ground to freeze.\n\nIt was the coldest day yet for the Ukrainian soldiers stationed here, and the first day Dadak noticed the ground beginning to harden, he said. But the dirt was still slick enough for military vehicles to slide and get stuck. Dadak said he hoped that in the next couple of weeks their vehicles would gain more traction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout a mile from the front line, Dadak marched through a field toward a group of soldiers taking cover in the only place they could a thin row of leafless trees that did very little to block the biting wind. The bright sun was deceiving; temperatures had dropped near freezing. The soldiers took turns warming up in a dugout with a wood-burning stove and just enough room for two small beds.\n\nTheir main focus was to hold a defensive position, just behind the front line, and prevent the Russians from advancing north to the highway that connects Zaporizhzhia to the Donetsk region.\n\nBut the long-term goal, Dadak said, was to push south to the Sea of Azov . With the right momentum, Ukrainian forces could encircle the troops now on the east bank of Dnieper River after surrendering the city of Kherson and towns on the west bank.\n\nAbout 30,000 Russian troops are on the east bank of the river in the Kherson region, according to rough intelligence estimates, Dadak said.\n\nBut the immediate challenges are fierce. The ground is even muddier than in the Kherson region, Dadak said. And, after abandoning Kherson city, Russia redistributed its troops to the east, boosting its presence in Zaporizhzhia. Shelling has intensified ever since, Dadak and his soldiers said.\n\nRussias force density has increased, Muzyka said, meaning it has more troops per square mile than it had at the start of the war. \"So if Ukrainians do attack, it will not be easy,\" Muzyka said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWhile the relatively flat terrain and lack of rivers in the Zaporizhzhia region will make it easier for Ukraine to push south here, it will also give the troops fewer places to hide.\n\n\"I think that Ukrainians are probably looking at a couple of areas where they can potentially conduct a counterattack,\" Muzyka said. \"Zaporizhzhia is the most obvious one, which probably means it might not happen there.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the Ukrainian militarys long-term goals appears to be an offensive that cuts south to occupied Melitopol, said Michael Kofman, a Russian military analyst at the Center for a New American Security, a Virginia-based research group.\n\nThe Russian military has been preparing for a Ukrainian offensive in Zaporizhzhia since summer, Kofman said. The Ukrainians, however, carried out offensives in Kharkiv and Kherson, west of the Dnieper River.\n\n\"Whether they can do this sometime later in the winter or next spring remains very much a question,\" Kofman said.\n\nUkraine has sought to stabilize the line in the battered city of Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region, and a second set of forces is trying to push back the Russian military in the Luhansk region.\n\nThe question is whether Ukrainian forces have the available troops and artillery ammunition to pull off a southern offensive in the coming months, especially after taking casualties fighting in Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian towns closest to the front line appear nearly abandoned for most of the day, with residents emerging from their bunkers only in the morning, when Russian shelling briefly pauses. In the town of Huliaipole, famous for being the birthplace of Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary Nestor Makhno, a missile strike on city hall about a month and a half ago killed the towns deputy mayor and one of his aides. Another recent strike destroyed a large public library, leaving a mountain of rubble.\n\nSteps away, bags of sand surrounded a statue of Makhno, protecting it from the onslaught of shelling.\n\nDadak has seen the Russians using more helicopters here than they used to, he said. A nearby unit recently acquired rockets for the sole purpose of shooting down Russian helicopters.\n\nNearby booms of mortars and artillery have become more frequent, said a group of four Ukrainian soldiers based about a mile behind the front line, whom The Post agreed to identify only by their first names because of security risks.\n\n\"This is our situation, day and night,\" said one soldier, Volodymyr, who planned to head to the front line on Thursday, his 47th birthday. The shelling has become worse since the liberation of Kherson, he said, smoking a cigarette in a dark and cramped bunker.\n\nWith the temperatures dropping, Volodymyr said he wasnt worried about the winter. The military had been preparing the soldiers with plenty of warm gear, he said. \"The most important thing is to have a cold winter, not a muddy one,\" he said.\n\nMaybe then, the soldiers said, they could see some movement.\n\n\"The momentum in Kherson gave us a boost in morale and hope that we could also do something like that here,\" said another soldier, Ihor, 36.\n\nBut Serhii, 26, said he had no clue whether it would happen in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We could be here all winter,\" Serhii said.",

                "cc_text": "MOSCOW -- Russia's foreign minister accused the West on Thursday of becoming directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine by supplying the country with weapons and training its soldiers.\n\nForeign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said that Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities and other key infrastructure were intended to weaken Ukraine's military potential and derail the shipments of Western weapons.\n\n\"You shouldn't say that the U.S. and NATO aren't taking part in this war. You are directly participating in it,\" Lavrov said in a video call with reporters. \"And not just by providing weapons but also by training personnel. You are training their military on your territory, on the territories of Britain, Germany, Italy and other countries.\"\n\nHe said the barrages of missiles, drones and artillery fire that have left millions of Ukrainians without power, heating and water were intended to \"knock out energy facilities that allow you to keep pumping deadly weapons into Ukraine in order to kill the Russians.\"\n\n\"The infrastructure that is targeted by those attacks is used to ensure the combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces and the nationalist battalions,\" Lavrov said.\n\nUkraine and the West have accused Russia of targeting key civilian infrastructure in order to reduce morale, cause Ukraine's people to suffer during the winter and to force the government in Kyiv into peace talks on Moscow's terms.\n\nThe southern city of Kherson, which Russia's forces seized in the opening days of the conflict and withdrew from last month, is among the places targeted. Russian shelling on Thursday cut off power in the recently liberated city just days after it was restored.\n\nWeeks before the pullback allowed Ukrainian forces to reclaim Kherson, Russia declared the entire Kherson region part of its territory along with three other regions following hastily called \"referendums\" that Ukraine and the West rejected as shams.\n\nAsked how the strikes on infrastructure in Kherson and other areas comply with Moscow's stated goal of protecting Ukraine's Russian-speaking population, Lavrov responded by drawing parallels with the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II.\n\n\"The city of Stalingrad also was part of our territory, and we beat the Germans to make them flee,\" he said.\n\nLavrov insisted that Moscow remains open for talks on ending the conflict. \"We never asked for talks but always said that we are ready to listen to those who are interested in a negotiated settlement,\" he said.\n\nThe Kremlin has urged Ukraine to acknowledge Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, as part of Russia and to recognize other land gains that Russia has made since sending its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. It also has pushed for guarantees that Ukraine wouldn't join NATO, along with vaguely formulated \"demilitarization\" and \"denazification\" goals.\n\nAsked if a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden was possible, Lavrov replied that \"we don't shun contacts\" but added that \"we haven't yet heard any serious ideas yet.\"\n\nLavrov said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has raised the issue of U.S. citizens imprisoned in Russia in a phone call, but he noted that Putin and Biden agreed to set up a separate channel of communication between special services to discuss the issue when they met in Geneva in June 2021.\n\n\"It's working, and I hope that some results will be achieved,\" he said.\n\nThe Biden administration has tried for months to negotiate the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner and another American jailed in Russia, Michigan corporate security executive Paul Whelan, including through a possible prisoner swap with Moscow.\n\nCommenting on Russia's decision to postpone a round of nuclear arms control talks with the United States that was scheduled for this week, Lavrov maintained \"it's impossible to discuss strategic stability nowadays while ignoring everything that is happening in Ukraine.\"\n\n\"The goal has been announced to defeat Russia on the battlefield or even destroy Russia,\" he said. \"How can the goal of defeating Russia not bear significance for strategic stability, considering that they want to destroy a key strategic stability actor?\"\n\nDuring the online news conference that lasted for 2 hours, Lavrov railed against the U.S. and its NATO allies, accusing them of trampling on international law while trying to isolate and destroy Russia.\n\nHe claimed the U.S. has tried to discourage other countries, including India, from maintaining close ties with Russia but said those attempts have failed.\n\nCIVILIAN IMPACT\n\nIn Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned the capital's millions of residents that they should stock up on water and preserved food to see them through a winter that could prove miserable if more energy infrastructure is damaged.\n\nHe also urged people to consider leaving the city to stay with friends or family elsewhere, if possible.\n\n\"Trying months lie ahead. The enemy still possesses substantial resources,\" Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said. He added, however, that \"signs are accumulating that [Russia] needs a pause at all costs.\"\n\nUkraine has faced a blistering onslaught of Russian artillery fire and drone attacks since early October. The shelling has been especially intense in Kherson since Russian forces withdrew and Ukraine's army reclaimed the southern city almost three weeks ago.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said Thursday that at least two civilians were killed and six others wounded nationwide by the latest Russian shelling. In Kherson, a 70-year-old woman was killed in her apartment and a 64-year-old man was wounded on the street. A 15-year-old boy died when a hospital in the northeastern Sumy region town of Bilopillia was hit, the presidential office said.\n\nLocal authorities said about two-thirds of Kherson had electricity as of Thursday night. Some residents congregated at the train station or at government-supported tents that provided heating, food, drinks and electricity to charge cellphones.\n\nWalking gingerly toward an evacuation train, 79-year-old Liudmyla Biloshysta said she decided to leave and join her children in Kyiv because she feared conditions in Kherson would worsen.\n\n\"The strike was so massive our house even began to shake,\" Biloshysta said of the latest barrage. \"These bombardments make me so scared.\"\n\nAlluding to her birth during World War II, she said, \"I was a child of war and now I'm a granny in wartime.\"\n\nIn the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, Russian forces fired \"from evening till morning\" at Ukrainian-held towns facing the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant across the Dnieper River, the regional governor said Thursday.\n\n\"Eight shelling attacks per night. The Russians from evening till morning struck the Nikopol area with [multiple rocket launchers] and heavy artillery. Two districts -- Marhanets and Chervonohryhorivka -- came under enemy fire,\" governor Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian forces continued their attempts to encircle the Donetsk region city of Bakhmut, focusing on several villages around it and trying to cut a key highway.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Inna Varenytsia, Jamey Keaten, Yuras Karmanau, Joanna Kozlowska and staff members of The Associated Press.\n\nIn this handout photo released by the Russian Foreign Ministry Press Service, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attends a meeting with Cuba's President of the Council of State Esteban Lazo Hernandez, in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 1, 2022.

                "cc_text": "Text Also Approved on International Year of Dialogue as Guarantee of Peace, 2023\n\nThree decades since it created the United Nations humanitarian system, the General Assembly today adopted four resolutions to bolster a beleaguered relief apparatus struggling to help nearly 400 million people facing severe crises around the planet, as well as a text on the culture of peace.\n\nIn opening remarks, Csaba Krsi (Hungary), President of the General Assembly, said a meeting on strengthening the coordination of emergency and humanitarian assistance of the United Nations could not come at a more fitting moment, as the world today is in a permanent state of humanitarian crisis. \"We are breaking all the wrong records,\" he said.\n\nReferring to the Global Humanitarian Overview 2023 issued last week by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, he said the world is facing the highest number of violent conflicts since 1945 and 399 million people, the highest number ever, need humanitarian assistance. \"Statistics are the human beings with the tears wiped off,\" he said, adding that this powerful image shows families, including children, the elderly and women, behind the statistics. \"They are all of us.\"\n\nUnderscoring 2022 as the thirty-first anniversary of Assembly resolution 46/182 (1991), he urged Member States to act on this sessions drafts to ensure a culture of transformational change. The Central Emergency Response Fund is one of the fastest ways to scale up and provide sustained relief operations, he added, when no other funding is available.\n\nThe Assembly then adopted the four humanitarian resolutions without a vote.\n\nIn adopting the 19-page resolution \"Strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations\", the Assembly reaffirms the principles of its landmark resolution 46/182 of December 1991, encouraging the international community to support Member States efforts to prepare for disasters. The text also encourages the development of multi-hazard warning systems and recognition of the Central Emergency Response Funds achievements.\n\nAligning himself with the European Union, the representative of Sweden introduced the draft, which he said equips the humanitarian community with the necessary framework to deliver assistance. The text introduces important language on climate change, cash assistance, safety and security of humanitarian personnel, need to narrow the humanitarian funding gap and strengthen partnerships with international financial institutions. \"We, as Member States of the United Nations, need to translate the words of the resolution into concrete action to save lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity across the globe.\"\n\nAccording to the resolution \"International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development\", the Assembly recognizes the relationship between emergency response, rehabilitation and development, as well as the need to ensure a smooth transition between the three stages.\n\nThe delegate of Pakistan, speaking on behalf of the \"Group of 77\" developing countries and China, introduced that draft, stressing the importance of assisting countries and people affected by natural disasters. Underlining the importance of early action to minimize the impact of natural disasters, the draft recognizes the special financial needs of countries facing compound risks caused by humanitarian emergencies, natural disasters and climate change, he said.\n\nBy the terms of the resolution \"Assistance to the Palestinian people\", the Assembly underlines the importance of emergency and humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip and the need to advance its reconstruction. The text calls on the international community to provide urgently needed assistance and services to ease the difficult humanitarian situation faced by Palestinian women, children and their families and help reconstruct and develop relevant Palestinian institutions.\n\nIntroducing the resolution, the representative of the Czech Republic, speaking for the European Union, expressed concern over the difficult humanitarian situation affecting Palestinians throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly the Gaza Strip. He called for full, unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza, noting that the European Union will keep contributing to Gazas development through investments in reforms, support to economic sectors and work in the water and energy sectors. The bloc expects that Israel will facilitate such efforts, he said.\n\nThe Permanent Observer for the State of Palestine said there is no effective humanitarian response without a political response, underscoring the importance of delivering international action and promoting peaceful settlement to end the humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nBy the terms of the fourth resolution, \"Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel\", the Assembly strongly condemned all acts of violence, attacks and threats against humanitarian, as well as United Nations and associated personnel. The text also calls upon States to explore and scale up measures for more systematic monitoring, reporting and investigation of attacks against humanitarian and medical personnel.\n\nThe Czech Republics delegate, who also introduced this draft, on behalf of the European Union, said instability, armed conflict and climate change have created the greatest need for humanitarian assistance in decades. As humanitarian personnel face high risks to meet these needs, the international community has the moral obligation to mitigate this risk.. He noted two worrying trends that emerged in 2022: disinformation campaigns that undermine trust in the United Nations and humanitarian organizations and put their personnel at risk; and the negative impact on mental health and psychosocial well-being faced by nationally and locally recruited personnel.\n\nDelegates also emphasized the need for greater coordination, stronger frameworks and financing to meet the escalating humanitarian needs of the planets people.\n\n\"The system is under water,\" said Switzerlands delegate, noting that expanding humanitarian needs are overwhelming the system and that the current trajectory is unsustainable. The Assembly can help the United Nations system provide a more coordinated response with resolutions laying down the regulatory framework. A more proactive approach is needed to reduce the impact of certain shocks, such as climate change. \"We are speaking of attitudes here,\" she said. \"It is urgent to change the entire mindset of humanitarian work.\"\n\nThe representative of Brunei Darussalam, speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said that improving disaster management, risk and response capabilities is essential to build resilient communities and reach the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world, ASEAN is expanding its practices on disaster risk reduction and management and emergency response. Speaking also on behalf of Sweden, Indias representative expressed commitment to preserving the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence in responding to all humanitarian situations. She called the $51.5 billion needed to help 230 million of the worlds most vulnerable people, as cited in the Global Humanitarian Review 2023, a formidable challenge for the entire international community, but highlighted encouraging improvements in data collection and flexible instruments like the Central Emergency Response Fund and Country-Based Pool Funds.\n\nThe observer for the Sovereign Order of Malta said the United Nations is the last best hope to energize will and power to break through differences and put the needs of the sick, poor and marginalized at the centre. \"If all of us expand our collective collaboration with UN aid agencies and related bodies, we can be on the right side of history and continue to earn the respect of those who are, tragically, on the wrong side of the economic divide,\" he said.\n\nThe Assembly then turned to its agenda item on \"Culture of Peace\", adopting without a vote the resolution \"International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace, 2023\". Introducing the resolution, the representative of Turkmenistan said it was a product of comprehensive consultations, reflecting the main principles of the United Nations Charter to settle disputes by peaceful means and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\n\nAlso speaking today were representatives of Maldives, Qatar, Iran, Belarus, Poland, Philippines, Egypt, China, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Australia, United States, Russian Federation, Norway, Thailand, Canada, Romania, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Trkiye, Morocco, Chile, Kuwait, Sudan, France, Ukraine and Bangladesh, as well as the European Union.\n\nThe representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) also delivered a statement.\n\nThe Assembly will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 December, to consider the reports of the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) and at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 December, to consider the reports of the Sixth Committee (Legal) and then take up the issue of cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations.\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nCSABA KRSI (Hungary), President of the General Assembly, said a meeting on strengthening the coordination of emergency and humanitarian assistance of the United Nations could not come at a more fitting moment, as the world today is in a permanent state of humanitarian crises. \"We are breaking all the wrong records,\" he said. The 2023 global humanitarian overview outlines this situation in stark terms, noting the highest number of violent conflicts since 1945 and 399 million people, the highest number ever, in need of humanitarian assistance. Pointing to worlds highest numbers of people at risk of hunger and forcibly displaced, he added that increases in gender-based violence and sexual harassment are especially alarming. \"Statistics are the human beings with the tears wiped off,\" he said, adding that this powerful image shows the families, including children, the elderly and women, behind the statistics. \"They are all of us.\"\n\nThe Assembly and Member States simply must do better, he said, as many people will be unable to survive the days ahead. \"Every Member State must be distressed,\" he added, referring to killings, kidnappings and arbitrary detainments. On this date, the thirtyfirst anniversary of the resolution 46/182 (1991), which created the Organizations humanitarian system, he urged the Assembly to act on this years drafts to strengthen its response. The draft resolutions are necessary to ensure a culture of transformational change. The Central Emergency Response Fund is one of the fastest ways to scale up and provide sustained relief operations, when no other funding is available, he said, adding that investment in the Fund embodies this spirit of transformation. All groups, including civil society and the private sector, must work together and develop innovative practices to improve coordination and recovery efforts.\n\nIntroduction of Draft Resolutions\n\nMAGNUS LENNARTSSON ( Sweden ), aligning himself with the European Union, introduced the draft resolution titled \"Strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations\" (document A/77/L.30). Noting that his country has facilitated negotiations of the text since landmark General Assembly resolution 46/182 which created the foundations of todays United Nations humanitarian system was adopted in 1991, he said the current draft equips the humanitarian community with the framework it needs to provide such assistance. The text introduces important language on climate change, cash assistance, safety and security of humanitarian personnel, the need to narrow the humanitarian funding gap and strengthen partnerships with international financial institutions, and accountability to affected populations. Encouraging consensus adoption, he said that \"we, as Member States of the United Nations, must hold ourselves accountable by translating the words of the resolution into concrete action to save lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity across the globe.\"\n\nMOHAMMAD AAMIR KHAN ( Pakistan ), speaking on behalf of the \"Group of 77\" developing countries and China, introduced the draft resolution on \"International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development\" (document A/77/L.32) and stressed the importance of providing assistance to countries and people affected by natural disasters. The draft recognizes a relationship between emergency response, rehabilitation and development as well as the need to ensure a smooth transition between the three stages, he observed. Further, it emphasizes that emergency assistance must ensure long-term support to affected countries. This year, the text contains new paragraphs that aim to further strengthen humanitarian assistance, prevention, preparedness, response and recovery efforts to help minimize the loss of lives and damage caused by natural disasters. The draft encourages efforts to identify best practices to ensure humanitarian response and mitigate the humanitarian impact of natural disasters, he stressed, pointing to increased efforts to prevent famine, food insecurity and malnutrition related to natural disasters. It also incorporates mental health support services into disaster response and recovery. Underlining the importance of early action, with a view to minimizing the impact of natural disasters, the draft recognizes the special financial needs of countries facing compound risks caused by humanitarian emergencies, natural disasters and climate change, he stressed.\n\nJAKUB KULHNEK ( Czech Republic ), speaking for the European Union, next introduced the draft resolution titled \"Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel\" (document A/77/L.35). Pointing out that humanitarian needs continued to grow in 2022, he said that instability, armed conflict and climate change have created the greatest need for humanitarian assistance in decades. United Nations and humanitarian personnel are facing high risks to meet these needs, and the international community has the moral obligation to mitigate this risk as much as possible.\n\nHe went on to note that two worrying trends have emerged in 2022, the first being disinformation campaigns that undermine trust in the United Nations and humanitarian organizations and put their personnel at risk. The second is the negative impact on mental health and psychosocial well-being faced by nationally and locally recruited personnel. The resolution notes these concerns, he said, welcoming it as a consensual document reflecting a common commitment to humanitarian action. He stressed that those risking their lives to help others deserve the General Assemblys support.\n\nHe then introduced the draft resolution titled \"Assistance to the Palestinian people\" (document A/77/L.34), expressing concern over the difficult humanitarian situation affecting Palestinians throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly the Gaza Strip. The European Union deplores the continuing risk of demolition and seizure of Palestinian structures in the occupied West Bank, he said, calling on Israel to allow for a tangible improvement in the freedom of movement and living conditions for those living there. The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains a grave concern and, while welcoming the easing of some restrictions, he called for full, unimpeded humanitarian access.\n\nThe European Union will continue to contribute to Gazas development through investments in reforms, support to economic sectors and work in the water and energy sectors and the bloc expects that Israel will facilitate such efforts, he said. Underscoring that a fundamental change of the situation in Gaza is necessary to ensure lasting results, he called on all parties to take urgent steps towards this end pursuant to Security Council resolution 2334 (2016). He added that this includes an end to the closure policy, the full opening of crossing points and the provision of full humanitarian access, while addressing Israels legitimate security concerns.\n\nHe next turned to the agenda item \"Strengthening of international cooperation and coordination of efforts to study, mitigate and minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster\". He recalled that, 36 years ago, the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant caused by the Soviet Unions reckless policies regarding nuclear safety spelled widespread consequences for Ukraine and other countries in the region. Europe was among the first to respond to that disaster and assist Ukraine, expending more than 1 billion (about $1 billion) in grants and loans to ensure safe containment of the No.4 reactor, effective radioactive-waste management and assistance to affected regions. The European Union will continue to focus its nuclear-safety-related assistance on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, where estimated damage caused by Russian troops 83,939,963.76 including to a lab originally provided by the bloc amounts to 80 million (about $83,923,487.9).\n\nRecalling that the tragedy at Chernobyl triggered a strong response from the international community, he underscored a need for the same today to support Ukraine. He urged the consideration of new, legally binding international rules to prohibit armed attacks against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes, noting that nuclear safety in Ukraine is again in jeopardy due to the Russian Federations unprovoked, unjustified war of aggression. He urged Moscow to immediately withdraw from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and return control thereof to the legitimate Ukrainian authorities in full respect of Ukraines sovereignty, independent and territorial integrity.\n\nStatements\n\nNOOR QAMAR SULAIMAN ( Brunei Darussalam ), speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), commended efforts of the Office of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) as well as all humanitarian workers. Her region is one of the most disaster-prone in the world, she said, noting that ASEAN is further strengthening its practices on disaster risk reduction and management and emergency response, including through the operationalization of ASEAN Vision 2025 on Disaster Management, which aims to mobilize greater resources and establish stronger coordination. Further, the first ASEAN Disaster Resilience Platform was convened in June 2022, she said, stressing the need for a holistic, cross-pillar and cross-sectoral approach.\n\nHighlighting the blocs cooperation with partners and other stakeholders, she welcomed the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between ASEAN and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) on the Strengthening of Community Resilience in Southeast Asia in May 2022. Noting the upcoming high-level meeting, in May 2023, of the Assembly on the midterm review of the implementation of the Sendai Framework, she emphasized that improving disaster management and risk and response capabilities is essential in building resilient societies and communities as well as to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nMs. SCHEUER ( Switzerland ) said global humanitarian needs are increasing every year, overwhelming the humanitarian system. \"The system is under water,\" she said, adding that the current trajectory is unsustainable. The only solution is to address root causes of crisis, including conflicts, forced displacement and epidemics. The Assembly can help the United Nations system provide a more coordinated response, she stressed, noting that these resolutions provide the regulatory framework. More support and financing should be given to local actors, who are the first responders. International humanitarian law must be upheld to ensure access for responders and a more proactive approach is needed to reduce the impact of certain shocks, such as climate change. \"We are speaking of attitudes here,\" she said. \"It is urgent to change the entire mindset of humanitarian work.\"\n\nHUSSAIN A. MOHAMED HUSSAIN ( Maldives ), noting that 90 per cent of refugees come from countries that are among the most vulnerable and the least ready to adapt to climate change, pointed out that by 2050, approximately 1 billion people are projected to be at risk from coastal-specific climate hazards. His country, where most of the land area is less than one metre above sea level, is already suffering the impact of coastal erosion, frequent monsoon flooding and intense sea surges. Pointing to the record-breaking rains in Pakistan as well as the catastrophic loss caused by hurricanes Fiona and Ian in North and Central America, he added that across the Horn of Africa, humanitarian emergencies caused by acute drought have affected an approximate 36.1 million people. Applauding the establishment of a loss and damage fund for vulnerable countries at the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in Sharm elSheikh, he also emphasized the need for finalizing and implementing a multidimensional vulnerability index.\n\nABDULAZIZ F. A. AL THANI ( Qatar ), spotlighting Qatars leading role in humanitarian aid and assistance, said his country recently donated $12 billion to the Horn of Africa and announced $20 million to support African countries in accessing food exports from Ukraine. In providing multi-year, non-earmarked aid for the United Nations agencies, Qatar has worked closely with strategic partners, including OCHA and committed to supporting the Central Emergency Response Fund with $2 million for 2022-2023. It has also provided humanitarian aid and assistance to the Palestinian people, including the signing of a multi-year agreement with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in 2018. Going forward, Qatar will continue to provide development aid and assistance, support United Nations agencies and cooperate on humanitarian affairs, he pledged.\n\nZAHRA ERSHADI ( Iran ) voiced concern over the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine and Yemen, including the massive influx of displaced Afghans to neighbouring countries. She stressed that humanitarian crises must not lead to foreign intervention, including under the pretext of the responsibility to protect. While West Asia is prone to a variety of disasters, such as earthquakes, droughts and floods, Iran has suffered tremendously from the additional weight of unlawful and illegal unilateral sanctions. On the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, she stressed that, as winter approaches and the situation of the Afghan people especially women, girls and children continues to deteriorate, the timely provision of humanitarian assistance and release of Afghanistans frozen assets should in no way be politicized. To tackle environmental challenges in West Asia, Iran with agencies related to the United Nations will convene an International Conference on Combating Sand and Dust Storms in 2023, she said.\n\nMr. AMBRAZEVICH ( Belarus ) said that his country is doing everything possible to assist nations facing humanitarian crises. Over the past 20 years, Belarus has participated in 76 humanitarian missions to 32 countries and, in November, prepared shipments to be sent to Syria and Pakistan. Turning to the Chernobyl disaster, he said that its consequences for Belarus were comparable with the destruction caused by the Second World War. International solidarity to respond to this disaster represented a \"shining example\" of diplomacy and dedicated, depoliticized international cooperation, he noted, stating that the people of Belarus will never forget this aid. Now, Belarus has evolved from a recipient country to a full-pledged humanitarian partner and is willing to share its expertise in addressing large-scale, anthropogenic disasters. He added a call for international cooperation regarding Chernobyl to continue in the spirit of coordination and partnership, urging that the issue not serve as a platform for manipulation or exacerbation of confrontation.\n\nKAROLINA KRUPA, Director of the Development Cooperation Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland , said that, since 24 February, one of the biggest humanitarian crises since Second World War has been unfolding in the territory of its immediate neighbour, Ukraine. Just hours later, the Polish Government began assisting Ukrainian civilians who were forced to move from peace to war overnight. Some 77 per cent of Poles have been involved in various kinds of assistance for Ukraine and its people, who found refuge in Polish territory. She stressed that the international communitys overall humanitarian response must be coordinated and coherent, and concrete actions and innovations prioritized, with respect for international humanitarian law. For Poland, respect for international humanitarian law, international law, human principles and accountability are core rules that make the humanitarian system reliable for civilians who find themselves in conflict zones.\n\nBJRN OLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, reiterated the commitment of its member States in protecting humanitarian space and deterring violations of international humanitarian law. Continued violations lead to massive assistance and protection needs for civilians and prevent vital assistance from reaching those in need. As principled humanitarian actors and medical workers must never be targets, perpetrators must be held accountable, he said. In expressing his concern over the rise of information manipulation which can undermine trust in humanitarian organizations and place their personnel at serious risk, he called on States and parties to conflict to prevent disinformation. To ensure that humanitarian space remains open for all necessary aid to reach those in need, States must undertake mitigating measures to prevent any potentially negative impact of sanctions and counter-terrorism measures on humanitarian activities. Accountability measures, he continued, must take a survivor-centred approach and avoid retraumatizing those who have already suffered harm.\n\nTurning his attention to the unprecedented global food crisis which has been exacerbated by climate change and conflict, he called for urgent action to keep famine at bay. With no time to lose, the European Union has increased its humanitarian food assistance by 64 per cent since 2020 and has allocated 8 billion to the Team Europe Response to Global Food Insecurity until 2024. Others must step up too, he urged as he outlined the need for atscale multi-sectoral solutions, holistic responses which address root causes and the front-loading of funding to enable early response and investments in sustainable solutions that build community resilience. The donor base for humanitarian action must be expanded, he added. \"Helping the most vulnerable people around the world is a shared responsibility and we need to see a much broader group of countries contributing to humanitarian funding,\" he stressed.\n\nANTONIO M. A. LAGDAMEO ( Philippines ) spotlighted his countrys experiences with disasters to underscore the importance of humanitarian resolutions. Anticipatory action can reduce the impact of crises, he noted as he highlighted his countrys development plan to manage multi-dimensional risks from natural disasters and pandemics. As information and communications technology (ICT) also has a critical role in risk assessment, disaster risk reduction and the provision of humanitarian assistance, States must bridge the divide including through technology transfers. The Philippines, he noted, will continue to strengthen its multi-hazard, impact-based forecasting and early warning action systems to develop rights-based and gender-responsive social protection programmes. Turning his attention to the plight of migrants, he called on all States to fully respect international human rights law and international humanitarian law, ensure the lawful provision of assistance and account for such populations in crisis preparedness, emergency response and post-crisis action.\n\nAHMED MOHAMED E A ELSHANDAWILY ( Egypt ) raised concern over the unprecedented increase in humanitarian assistance over the course of the last year, in addition to the adverse impact of climate change. Warning against the continuous impact of the COVID19 pandemic, he stressed the need to take expedited measures to tackle food insecurity, enhance international cooperation and avoid a spike in humanitarian aid. The international community must take effective measures to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of people who are still facing crises, he said, stressing the importance of protecting civilians. In this context, he called for political solutions and investments in capacity-building to create an environment conducive to sustainable development. The principles of humanitarian work including impartiality, independence and non-interference in internal affairs must be respected, he asserted, supporting all efforts to end conflicts and alleviate human suffering.\n\nMOHAMMED ABDULAZIZ H. ALATEEK ( Saudi Arabia ) said the coordination of humanitarian assistance is one of the General Assemblys most important agenda items, at a time when the world is still recovering from the economic and health impacts of the pandemic. It is incumbent on the international community to respond to the unprecedented number of crises. The 2023 global humanitarian plan launched last week shows that 399 million people in 69 States need assistance and that the cost will reach $51.5 billion, up 25 per cent over 2022. As one of the largest international humanitarian donors, Saudi Arabia considers such aid one of its most important priorities. The third Riyadh International Humanitarian Forum will be held in Saudi Arabia in February 2023, providing an important platform to coordinate international humanitarian responses. Strategic planning, based on scientific principles, is also needed, as is protected and safe access for humanitarian workers. He said the Saudi Government has responded to humanitarian emergencies around the world, including donations of $10 million to Pakistan; more than $18 billion to Yemen; and $5.2 billion to the Palestinian cause.\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ) called on the international community to strengthen solidarity and cooperation, which should adhere to humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law, respect the sovereignty of recipient countries, avoid interference in internal affairs and prevent the politicization and instrumentalization of humanitarian issues. The protection of vulnerable groups should be strengthened and unilateral coercive measures lifted at an early date to avoid exacerbating already dire situations, he added. He called on donors to increase their assistance, close the funding gap, respond to all humanitarian crises without discrimination and provide a particular helping hand to African countries. The international community, he continued, must combine short-term assistance with long-term development, increase development assistance and ensure a smooth transition from relief to development. It must also increase assistance to developing countries to enhance their capacities in disaster prevention and reduction. Developed countries must accelerate their support through funds, technologies and means, earnestly fulfilling their historical responsibility and international obligations to address climate change, he urged.\n\nMATTHEW CHAN ( Singapore ), associating himself with ASEAN, emphasized the need for the United Nations system to adapt quickly to new and emerging challenges on disaster risk and management. Although the ASEAN region has experienced an increased frequency of natural disasters with catastrophic consequences, he stressed, \"it is not too late to take decisive action\". There must be greater investment in resilience-building and early warning since prevention is significantly cheaper. As a small island developing State which faces the existential threat of sea level rise, Singapore has developed a costal-inland flood model to assess food risks and established a dedicated fund to finance the construction of drainage infrastructure and coastal protection measures. Partnerships with non-State actors to build resilience must be strengthened and technology to better predict disasters must be harnessed, he stressed. All Member States must work with and through the United Nations to build the resilience of the most vulnerable, he urged.\n\nMOHD ABDULRAHMAN MOHAMED JALIL SULTAN ALOLAMA ( United Arab Emirates ) stressed that humanitarian aid should be provided based on principles free of any religious, racial or political considerations. Describing prevention as the most cost-effective investment to protect humanity and improve adaptations to climate change by mitigating its effects, he urged the United Nations bodies to step up their actions and strengthen links with local communities in emergency responses, ensuring the participation of women. This strategy will facilitate access of entire populations to aid, especially the most vulnerable, he noted, commending the work of first responders to humanitarian crises. Reaffirming the common responsibility to take necessary measures to prevent local conflicts, he said the United Arab Emirates will continue to work closely with Member States, United Nations agencies and other stakeholders to provide a collective response to growing humanitarian needs worldwide.\n\nFIONA WEBSTER ( Australia ) said that, in 2023, the world will continue to face compounding challenges, including rising food insecurity, protracted conflicts, record levels of displacement and the impacts of climate change. This will require continued and increased humanitarian assistance, she said, while stressing that such assistance alone is not the solution. The international community must facilitate political solutions and hold warring parties to account for violations of international humanitarian law. Further, it must invest in a multi-hazard, cross-sectoral approach to disaster risk reduction, preparedness and resilience-building, while ensuring that gender equality, disability inclusion and localization are at the centre of such efforts. She added that, as the Asia-Pacific region is the most disaster-prone region in the world, her country was proud to host the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Brisbane in September.\n\nSAMUEL VIGERSKY ( United States ) said the world is facing an unprecedented crisis of food insecurity, as countries reel from hunger and malnutrition caused by the COVID19 pandemic, climate change and the Russian Federations illegal war against Ukraine. Families are facing impossible choices, as they are forced to decide which child to feed, wondering whether they will survive. The United States is stepping up on all fronts to meet urgent global challenges as the largest single humanitarian donor. It has provided $17 billion in humanitarian assistance in fiscal year 2022 and, since the Russian Federation launched its premeditated, unprovoked invasion in February, it has provided more than $1.5 billion in assistance to support displaced persons in Ukraine and the region. Further, it has committed nearly $11 billion since the invasion began to address the global food-security crisis. He went on to note that his country is also providing more than $2 billion in assistance for drought response in the Horn of Africa for fiscal year 2022, as well as being the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Detailing the pernicious effects of conflict on humanitarian actors, he underscored the need to promote accountability consistent with international humanitarian law across all conflicts.\n\nDMITRY S. CHUMAKOV ( Russian Federation ) said the Assembly was able to obtain consensus on three humanitarian resolutions this year, despite differing approaches, expressing hope this process will continue. Global humanitarian needs are alarming, with 399 million people needing help and a record amount of aid $55.1 billion required, he said, stressing that donor participation is more important than ever. The Russian Federation normally contributes through bilateral channels and entities in the United Nations system. Yet this year, the country has been subjected to a record number of sanctions by the United States and the European Union that have limited its ability to provide assistance. In 2021, before sanctions were imposed, the Russian Federation provided official development assistance (ODA) of $1.2 billion. He called on the Secretariat to seek solutions to this problem and for involved parties to understand how their responses are undermining humanitarian work. He disagreed with statements that the Russian Federation has triggered the global food and security crisis. As a producer of fertilizer and food, his country is motivated to expand its exports and create stable food markets,\n\nODD INGE KVALHEIM ( Norway ), voicing concern over the increasing level of global food insecurity, stressed the need for strengthened humanitarian assistance and protection. The protection of civilians including children has been a defining aspect of Norways tenure as an elected Security Council member, he noted before calling on all States to endorse and implement the Safe Schools Declaration. Turning to the need to work smarter and better, he said innovative solutions will be key to closing the growing gap between humanitarian needs and resources, improve responses and ultimately ensure better protection for people affected by conflict. In light of the need to reinforce local humanitarian action and ensure better accountability, Norway will continue to push for reforms which place the needs of people at the centre. He then called for closer collaboration between humanitarian efforts, long-term development assistance and peacebuilding; a stronger connection with climate change adaptation and prevention, including through finance for climate-robust food production; and increased anticipatory action.\n\nASYA THANCHITT ( Thailand ), aligning herself with ASEAN, stressed the need to further strengthen efforts to prevent, prepare for and address challenges at the local, national and regional levels. Humanitarian assistance must reach those in critical need in accordance with humanitarian principles and full respect for international humanitarian law, she stressed. As the COVID19 pandemic has demonstrated that health services are vital components in humanitarian relief efforts, Member States must work to advance universal health coverage and ensure essential health services and public health functions in emergencies. Coordination between health and disaster risk management sectors must increase, and medical personnel must have necessary protection and support, she added. She then emphasized the need to build the capacity of countries and relevant actors to prepare for and respond to natural hazards by strengthening the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.\n\nSHIRLEY ONG ( Canada ), noting that the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance climbed during 2022 to reach a staggering 324 million, voiced concern over the proliferation of armed conflicts worldwide. Moscows deplorable attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure have precipitated unprecedented rates of forced displacement in Europe, contributing to global food insecurity and a malnutrition crisis. Globally, forced displacement surpassed 100 million people, she said, adding that more than 300 million people need clean water, emergency medicine, shelter and food. Hundreds of millions are experiencing hunger, in some cases at catastrophic levels, she cautioned, pointing to the situations in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Haiti, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. Highlighting her countrys humanitarian priorities, she stressed the need to mobilize all possible resources, including those already in place. Further, she called for reinforcing the critical role of local and national actors, including women-led and refugee-led organizations, who are on the front lines of humanitarian responses. Drawing attention to the many underfunded humanitarian crises around the world including in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel she stressed that \"suffering is suffering, no matter where it is\". To protect the most vulnerable during armed conflict, Canada endorsed the Political Declaration on protecting civilians from the effects of armed conflict in populated areas, signed on 18 November in Dublin.\n\nANDREEA MOCANU ( Romania ), aligning herself with the European Union, said that 2022 was profoundly marked by the humanitarian crisis caused by the Russian Federations brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. To respond to the staggering number of people in need, Romania swiftly dispatched humanitarian assistance to provide relief to the most vulnerable among those affected by the war, and, most recently, it has consolidated its support for Ukraine during the winter months. A voluntary contribution of 300,000 is being disbursed, and Romania will also host a modular temporary shelter that will be fully equipped and ensure accommodation for up to 16,000 refugees. Also pointing out that the Russian Federations unlawful war triggered a record crisis in the neighbouring country of Moldova, she said that her country has contributed around 10.5 million in response. Detailing additional humanitarian assistance provided by her country, she added that Romania has joined international efforts to address food insecurity generated by Moscows aggression, as more than 8.5 million tons of Ukrainian agricultural products have transited Romania to reach countries in need.\n\nCAROLYN SCHWALGER ( New Zealand ), stressing the need to ensure the safety of humanitarian actors, noted the soaring demand for their assistance, driven by the compounding effects of the COVID19 pandemic and climate change as well as the lack of political will to prevent and end armed conflict. \"The warnings are clear: unless we can forge political solutions, next year food supplies could be tighter,\" she emphasized, commending the Black Sea Grain Initiative as an example of what can be achieved through talking rather than fighting. Turning to her countrys advocacy for women and girls in all their diversity, she stressed that their sexual and reproductive rights must be upheld in all contexts. Without this, gender equality and womens empowerment simply cannot be achieved. She then underscored the effects of climate change in driving and magnifying humanitarian needs, emphasizing the value of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, anticipatory action and emergency preparedness.\n\nJAMES KARIUKI ( United Kingdom ), calling for a shared vision and collaborative political will, said his country will use limited resources effectively by ensuring that humanitarian responses are accountable, data-driven and cost-effective. Digital cash transfers, he noted, are an effective and dignified way to deliver assistance, which his Government will champion and scale up. The United Kingdom, he continued, will uphold international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law by utilizing its position as a Council member to enable unhindered access to those in need, ensure accountability for those who violate humanitarian principles and the United Nations Charter in Ukraine, and bolster support to local, women-led organizations. To prevent todays problems from turning into tomorrows crises, his country will also leverage its networks to deepen early warning expertise, promote innovation and strengthen systems to prevent and anticipate shocks. Using its position on the boards of international financial institutions to unlock financing for these efforts, the United Kingdom will also continue to push for increased access to climate finance in climate-vulnerable countries.\n\nCEREN HANDE ZGR ( Trkiye ), calling for sufficient, predictable and sustained humanitarian assistance, noted that her country is doing its part as the second largest donor. As humanitarian aid must reach those in need through the most direct routes, efforts to ensure access to critical services and assistance must be guided solely by humanitarian considerations and not be politicized. She then reiterated her countrys support for renewal of the mandate for the United Nations cross-border humanitarian assistance mechanism for Syria, pledged its continued support to the Black Sea Grain Initiative and emphasized the need for humanitarian assistance to account for and act upon emerging risks and trends. The dignity, humane treatment, well-being and rights of migrants and refugees must be upheld as a moral and legal obligation for States, she continued. As the largest refugee hosting country, Trkiye also calls for greater solidarity as well as predictable and equitable responsibility sharing, she said, before expressing her support for UNRWA.\n\nOMAR HILALE ( Morocco ), stressing that the international community is facing a myriad of challenges that have exacerbated humanitarian needs, said humanitarian actors are struggling daily to respond not only to crises that are related to armed conflicts, but extreme climate events, including droughts, earthquakes and tsunamis. The impact of climate change, ranging from food insecurity to forced displacement, as well as the COVID19 pandemic and its direct and indirect impacts, is affecting the most vulnerable, particularly women and children. Early warning systems must cover multiple risks, he said, calling for flexible financing combined with climate forecasting. He underscored that alarming food insecurity and the risk of famine require a global coordinated response through humanitarian action that is in synergy with efforts for development and peacebuilding. To alleviate the suffering of the most vulnerable populations, he called for a diversified system of humanitarian partnerships, including Member States and the United Nations as well as international and regional humanitarian organizations. He also urged for greater mobilization by the international community to guarantee the security of medical and humanitarian staff.\n\nCARMEN NISHIHARA ( Chile ) expressed concern over escalating violence, especially that present in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian armed groups in the Gaza Strip. Noting that the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people increase every year, reflecting the gravity of economic and health crises faced by those in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, she underscored the need to provide assistance on the ground and increase resources available to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). She went on to stress that the disproportionate use of force has resulted in the loss of thousands of lives, and the indiscriminate use of violence against civilians is unacceptable. She called on both parties to abide by their obligations to protect civilians, also underlining the need to seek a lasting, just and sustainable solution. Chile will continue working to achieve two independent States with secure, internationally recognized borders, she said, reiterating her countrys support for Palestinians right to an independent country.\n\nRAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI ( India ), speaking also on behalf of Sweden, said the primary responsibility for providing protection and assistance in a humanitarian crisis lies with the concerned country and its national Government. Yet, when provided, international humanitarian assistance must be given impartially, according to guiding principles of relevant Assembly resolutions. India and Sweden remain committed to preserving the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence in responding to all humanitarian situations. Respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter, including sovereignty, political independence and the territorial integrity of Member States, should remain the basis for all humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe latest Global Humanitarian Overview report, released just a few days ago, gives details of humanitarian challenges facing the world, calling for $51.5 billion to bring life-saving support to 230 million of the worlds most vulnerable people. \"This is a formidable challenge for the entire international community, and one we cannot afford to downplay,\" he said. One encouraging indicator is that data collection has improved and flexible instruments like the Central Emergency Response Fund and Country-Based Pool Funds allow for the quick re-direction of resources to address the most acute needs. The private sector is increasingly stepping in as a strong and creative partner to traditional humanitarian actors. Moving forward, he urged the international community to look beyond immediate relief and rehabilitation and promote disaster resilience infrastructure through the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. The Coalitions membership has expanded to include 30 countries and seven multilateral organizations, he noted.\n\nMr. AL AJMI ( Kuwait ) underlined the importance of giving priority to humanitarian action, noting that precepts of the Muslim religion lead to extending a friendly hand to those who most need it. He reiterated the need for strengthening and coordinating human assistance and relief provided by the United Nations in the event of disasters and crisis. Turning to the report of the Secretary-General, he lamented the number of people who have fled their homes, including in the context of the COVID19 pandemic. Recalling violations of international humanitarian law in different parts of the world, he underscored that ongoing military occupation impacts the humanitarian, social and political life of the Palestinian people. In this regard, he also highlighted the \"war machine\" against unarmed civilians and continued blockade of the Gaza strip.\n\nABUZIED SHAMSELDIN AHMED MOHAMED ( Sudan ), emphasizing the need for increased funding to save lives, rehabilitate infrastructure and enable resilience, called for enhanced partnerships with regional and international organizations, donors, States and local communities. Increased coordination with local communities, he added, must offer the appropriate level of services, while balancing priorities in a manner addressing the humanitarian needs of all. Underscoring the importance of humanitarian work in peacebuilding, he said experience has demonstrated that humanitarian aid must expand to include projects which generate livelihoods, guarantee the stability of families and residents and avoid any displacement or friction. For humanitarian aid to arrive in a timely manner, States must respect humanitarian principles and operations and guarantee the protection and rehabilitation of humanitarian workers. He then spotlighted his Governments response to several crises and disasters in his country, adding that international support for those affected must not be tied to the political situation.\n\nYANN HWANG ( France ), associating himself with the European Union, warned that in 2023 over 339 million people will need humanitarian assistance. Stressing the importance of international humanitarian law and the preservation of humanitarian space, he cautioned that humanitarian workers, including local workers, are increasingly falling victim to attacks. The international community has a moral duty towards those who put their life in danger, he emphasized, adding that the perpetrators and accomplices of attacks against humanitarian workers must be prosecuted and punished. Warning against the consequences of climate change, he drew attention to the situation in Pakistan and the Horn of Africa. Condemning Moscows aggression in Ukraine, he said the Russian Federation is deliberately targeting civilians, using winter as a weapon of war. He highlighted initiatives such as corridors of solidarity, the farm initiative to support countries most affected by the global food crisis as well as the initiative to facilitate access to fertilizers for vulnerable countries, especially African countries. Further, he voiced support for an increased presence of women in management positions in humanitarian organizations.\n\nNATALIIA MUDRENKO ( Ukraine ), aligning herself with the European Union, said that the Russian Federations war on her country uprooted some 14.5 million Ukrainians, or one-third of the population. Since 24 February, Moscow has attacked Ukraine with more than 16,000 missiles, rockets, bombs and drones, 97 per cent of which targeted civilian infrastructure and residential areas. Millions of Ukrainians are now in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, she stressed, as \"winter is here, and this winter will be the hardest to live through\". Thanking all those who have provided help, she urged the international community to continue supplying aid and protection services to her country. She went on to point out that, despite the horrors of war, Ukraine is one of the guarantors of global food security. As of 2 December, over 12.4 million tons of grain and other foodstuffs have been exported via the Black Sea Grain Initiative, and Ukraine has also launched the \"Grain from Ukraine\" initiative, which will send 60 ships to countries including Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Kenya and Yemen to help those in need. Also detailing the consequences of the Russian Federations attack on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, she stressed that, without immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, grave risks to the nuclear safety of Ukraine and beyond will remain.\n\nMOSAMMAT SHAHANARA MONICA ( Bangladesh ), expressing her concern over negative impacts of growing global needs on humanitarian assistance for Rohingyas, urged partners to scale up their efforts for responsibility sharing and pay increased attention to the deteriorating situation in Myanmar. As a highly climate-vulnerable and disaster-prone country, Bangladesh recognizes the expanding need for the collection and sharing of data and evidence on displacement, she said. International emergency response mechanisms should be tailored to national priorities and the situation on the ground; backed by sustainable, flexible and multi-year financing support; and coordinated with national governments and other relevant actors. The international community, she continued, must undertake development activities with a focus on building resilience and reducing dependency. She then emphasized the importance of strengthening gender-responsive policy development for disaster risk reduction and mitigation, stressing the need to ensure accountability and justice for any reported violence against humanitarian personnel and civilian infrastructure.\n\nMAJED S. F. BAMYA, Permanent Observer for the State of Palestine , said there is no effective humanitarian response without a political response, underscoring the importance of delivering international action and promoting peaceful settlement to bring the humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to an end. He underscored that early international engagement for prevention and resolution of emergency situations will always be far less costly than a delayed, partial and insufficient response. Turning to the economic cost of the occupation of Palestine, estimated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) at $58 billion in lost potential gross domestic product (GDP) in the West Bank alone due to Israeli restrictions between 2000 and 2020, he said that price is higher than humanitarian assistance provided to the Palestinian people since 1948. \"Palestine can, virtually overnight, become aid independent, once its political independence is guaranteed\", he added.\n\nPETER DAVIDSON MCGUIRE, observer for the Sovereign Order of Malta , called for the international community to follow through with the funding promises made to at-risk nations. The Sovereign Order of Malta, he noted, is implementing measures to ensure that communities are prepared when disasters strike and has focused particularly on people who are least able to flee from war and conflict. He then spotlighted the Sovereign Order of Maltas support for Pakistan after the epochal level of flooding, the affected areas of the Chernobyl disaster and Palestine. The United Nations, he said, is the last best hope not only in coordinating humanitarian and disaster relief but also in energizing the will and power to break through differences and put the needs of the sick, poor and marginalized at the centre. \"If all of us expand our collective collaboration with the United Nations aid agencies and related bodies, we can be on the right side of history and continue to earn the respect of those who are, tragically, on the wrong side of the economic divide,\" he emphasized.\n\nLIANA GHUKASYAN, Permanent Observer for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), said that over the past decade, 83 per cent of all disasters were caused by climate-related events. She cautioned that 200 million people every year could need international humanitarian aid by 2050 due to a cruel combination of climate-related disasters and their socioeconomic impact. In this context, she urged all Member States to scale up locally led climate adaptation. As humanitarian impacts of climate change keep growing, so too should financing for local action on climate adaptation, ensuring it reaches the worlds most impoverished communities. No country is immune to the climate crisis and all Governments need to invest in climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction. However, some countries and communities are more vulnerable than others: they have greater exposure to extreme climate; higher susceptibility to disasters; and lower capacity to adapt. Thus, she called on Member States and United Nations agencies to prioritise the most vulnerable and commit to accountable funding allocation of climate finance for adaptation.\n\nShe also called on the international community to increase the amount of climate finance for local actors. Currently, only 10 per cent of adaptation funding is granted to the local level, with less than 2 per cent of total climate funding. The top 30 countries that receive the most adaptation funding are not among the top 30 most vulnerable countries. Additionally, multilateral humanitarian finance remains particularly difficult for local organizations and groups to access. International investment still flows mostly to international organizations, rather than local actors who are on the frontline of the fight against climate change, she emphasized. Raising concern over barriers to climate finance, she said a key part of the solution will be ensuring that climate, development, disaster risk reduction and humanitarian funds work together in a common purpose.\n\nLAETITIA MARIE ISABELLE COURTOIS, observer of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), called on all parties to facilitate the work of medical and humanitarian personnel, respect their safety and security, and preserve humanitarian space. Regarding the urbanization of warfare, she pointed to a milestone political declaration \"Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas\" adopted in Dublin last month by over 80 States. The Declaration aims to improve protection of civilians from explosive weapons in populated areas, one of the major causes of civilian harm in today's armed conflicts. This collective achievement has the potential to change the fate of hundreds of thousands of persons, she said, noting that for the first time in an instrument of this kind, States acknowledge the gravity of the problem and commit to taking concrete actions to address it. It sends a powerful signal that belligerents cannot continue fighting in populated areas the way they have until now, she stressed, urging for broader support for the Declaration. She also called on Member States to operationalize Security Council Resolution 2573 on the protection of essential services and comply fully with international humanitarian law.\n\nShe went on to underscore that, in recent years, several cyber operations have affected States' critical civilian infrastructure, such as nuclear plants, electricity grids and water systems, as well as humanitarian organizations. In this respect, the ICRC urges States to consider the risk of adverse humanitarian consequences when making any decision relating to cyber operations during armed conflicts. Further, she called on States to apply existing rules of international humanitarian law in good faith to ensure sufficient protection for civilians, civilian infrastructure and civilian data. States should also take measures to ensure that humanitarian organizations are protected online and offline and that civilians are protected against harmful information such as hate speech.\n\nActions on Draft Resolutions\n\nThe Assembly first adopted without a vote the resolution \"Strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations\" (document A/77/L.30).\n\nNext, it adopted without a vote the resolution \"International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development\" (document A/77/L.32).\n\nThe Assembly then adopted without a vote the resolution \"Assistance to the Palestinian people\" (document A/77/L.34).\n\nIt went on to adopt without a vote the resolution \"Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel\" (document A/77/L.35).\n\nStatements in Explanation of Position after Vote\n\nThe representative of Saudi Arabia , speaking for a group of countries in explanation of position after the vote, said his delegation joined consensus on resolution \"L.30\" because it believes in the importance of the topic. Turning to the topics on reproductive and sexual health and disease and health services, as mentioned in operative paragraphs 62 and 63, he noted that such issues should be considered in line with national legislation, including religious and social values of society.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation , while noting that her country traditionally joins consensus on resolutions concerning humanitarian personnel, said the International Court of Justice is deteriorating. Over its 20 years of existence, there have been scandalous falsifications and an unprecedented use of incorrect, politicized approaches. She therefore disassociated her delegation from the operative and preambular paragraphs of \"L.35\" relating to the Court.\n\nThe representative of Algeria , welcoming adoption of the resolutions, called on the international community to demonstrate further solidarity by providing humanitarian aid to people in vulnerable situations. Turning to the references on sexual and reproductive health care, he stressed that this concept and principle only refers to health care services in line with national legislation as well as cultural and religious values of societies. At the international level, they must be in line with agreed upon principles of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development as well as those adopted by the Assembly. On the global compact for migration, he underscored its legally nonbinding nature. Countries, he reaffirmed, have the sovereign right to adopt legislation as they see fit to manage their migration portfolios.\n\nThe representative of Trkiye , explaining her delegations position on operative paragraph 17 of \"L.32\", said there is no direct, causal link empirically evident between climate change and displacement, adding that assumptions linking the two phenomena hinders focus on the root causes of the latter. Recalling that various General Assembly resolutions concerning internally displaced persons, migration and disaster risk reduction refer to the adverse effects of climate change as \"one of the risk multipliers or push factors in certain instances, among other drivers\", said that this formulation reflects Trkiyes position on this issue.\n\nThe representative of the Philippines , reaffirming her commitment to the protection of humanitarian and United Nations personnel and the full-forced application of the law against persons who attack them, disassociated from all paragraphs mentioning the International Criminal Court, including preambular paragraph 32 and operative paragraph 8. The Philippines, she noted, withdrew from the Rome Statute on 17 March 2019 out of a principled stance against those who politicize human rights and disregard her countrys independent and well-functioning organs and agencies. As the Rome Statute is anchored on the principle of complementarity, the Court is not a substitute for national courts, she emphasized.\n\nThe representative of Hungary , speaking on preambular paragraph 13 of the resolution \"L.32\", recalled that his country did not endorse the Global Compact on Migration and does not participate in its implementation. In this regard, Hungary cannot accept any reference to the Compact in international documents and disassociates itself from preambular paragraph 13 of the resolution.A51\n\nThe observer of the Holy See recommended that all announcements on this process proceed through official communication channels in the future to ensure transparency and inclusivity so that all delegations are promptly informed and able to participate. In welcoming \"L.32\" for its language on identifying and applying lessons learned and best practices as well as its call on preventing famine and addressing food security and malnutrition, she expressed her reservations on two concepts in \"L.30\" and \"L.32\". The Holy See, she noted, does not consider abortion, access to abortion, or access to abortifacients as a dimension of the terms \"sexual and reproductive health\" and \"sexual and reproductive health-care services\". On \"gender\" and its derivatives, the Holy See understands the term to be grounded in biological sexual identity and difference.\n\nThe representative of Syria , speaking in exercise of the right of reply, condemned systematic looting perpetrated by the United States occupying forces. Opposing claims made by the United States delegation, she said her Government is sparing no effort to guarantee protection for humanitarian convoys. Voicing concern over the negative impact of the unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, she stressed that these illegal and unethical measures deepen the suffering of the Syrian people and lead to extreme shortage of medication as well as limited access to food, water, electricity and fuel. \"Only when the United States withdraws its forces from Syria, stops supporting separatist militias, lifts its unilateral coercive measures that contribute to the suffering of Syrians, only then can the United States talk about humanitarian assistance,\" she asserted.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation , speaking in exercise of her right of reply, refuted the open speculation and misinformation of Ukraine and its Western patrons concerning nuclear power plants. Providing an overview of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission to Chernobyl, she said the plant while under her countrys control was in a safe and secure condition where operators were not negatively affected nor stopped from working. Ukraine, on the other hand, created artificial obstacles for personnel and facilitated an emergency situation, she pointed out. Turning to the Zaporizhzhia power plant, she said Ukraines shelling constitutes the main threat to that plants security. The United States and its allies ignored the documents her country circulated in the Security Council and never doubt Ukraine. This is playing a game with the lives of people in that country and the entire European continent,\" she said, underscoring that the Russian Federation did everything necessary to safely carry out the IAEA mission. Western countries encouragement of Ukraines provocative actions on these two nuclear power plants creates the false idea that such actions will remain unpunished and will promote new and even more dangerous actions. These countries share the responsibility for these actions and consequences, she stressed.\n\nThe representative of Belarus underscored that international cooperation on Chernobyl must be continued exclusively in a spirit of partnership and that this issue should not become a platform for politicization, manipulation or aggravating confrontation. The consequences of the Chernobyl accident were a common affliction, and overcoming them is a common goal. For its part, Belarus remains committed to international cooperation in this area based on dialogue and partnership, and she recalled that her country provided around 20 million kilowatts of electricity to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in March and April to avoid a catastrophe in the region. She expressed hope that nuclear security will be an absolute priority for all stakeholders.\n\nCulture of Peace\n\nATA EYEBERDIYEV ( Turkmenistan ), introducing the draft resolution entitled \"International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace, 2023\" (document A/77/L.10), said the document reflects the main principles of the United Nations Charter to settle disputes by peaceful means and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. As the product of comprehensive consultations, the text reaffirms that inclusive dialogue plays an important role in strengthening cooperation and relations between Member States; emphasizes the role of women, youth, children and older persons; declares 2023 the International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace; and calls on the community of nations to resolve conflicts through inclusive dialogue and negotiation in order to ensure the strengthening of peace as a value that promotes sustainable development, security and human rights. Turkmenistans hosting of the international conference \"Dialogue is a Guarantee of Peace\" on 11 December is a timely and necessary step towards sustainable peace, he noted.\n\nAction on Draft Resolution\n\nThe Assembly adopted without a vote the resolution \"International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace, 2023\" (document A/77/L.10).\n\nBy its terms, the Assembly declared 2023 the International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace, underlining that this constitutes a means of mobilizing efforts of the international community to promote peace and trust among nations based on political dialogue, negotiations, mutual understanding and cooperation to build sustainable peace, solidarity and harmony. Calling on the international community to resolve conflicts through inclusive dialogue and negotiations to ensure the strengthening of peace and trust in relations between Member States in promoting sustainable development, peace and security and human rights, it invites Member States, United Nations entities, international and regional organizations and civil society to facilitate observance of the year and disseminate the advantages of peace and trust, including through educational and public awareness-raising activities.\n\nThe representative of the United States , speaking in explanation of position after the vote, said the resolution would have been stronger and more effective if it referred to tangible goals supported by data. She said her country supports the idea of \"friendship to all and malice towards none\", as referenced in preambular paragraph 14. However, the language in this paragraph does not explicitly clarify how the phrase will be used to strengthen international peace. Turning to paragraph 11 of the 1980/67 resolution of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, she pointed out that any decision on international years or dates should be announced a full year ahead of time, meaning that the first possible year to observe this international year will be 2024 and not 2023.\n\nThe representative of the United Kingdom said that, as the international community looks ahead to 2023 as the international year of dialogue as a guarantee of peace, it must recall what the Charter of the United Nations says about the principles of territorial integrity, sovereignty and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Stressing that \"actions must follow words\", she said the resolution cannot be implemented unless and until the Russian Federation stops its illegal war in Ukraine.",

                "cc_text": "Russias invasion of Ukraine has devastated the countrys food supply. But with extraordinary ingenuity and incredible resolve, plus targeted aid, its still functioning\n\nAfter Russian troops stormed the Ukrainian city of Bucha, three friends Anastasiya Yalanska, Serhiy Ustymenko, and Maxym Kuzmenko travelled the short distance from Kyiv to help distribute food to local residents cut off from the outside world.\n\nThey had begun volunteering a week or so earlier when Vladimir Putin first ordered his special military operation into Ukraine, travelling to nearby towns to help their fellow countrymen in desperate need of help.\n\n\"We helped a kindergarten in Brovary where about 40 children were left without food and items such as diapers and napkins,\" Yalanska wrote on Telegram at the time. \"We took a batch of aid to a military hospital; [and] we bought food for volunteer dogs that were left without the right food.\"\n\nThe friends knew that transporting food was a major risk. \"The bigger the hot spot you are heading to, the more you will be dissuaded at checkpoints,\" Yalanska wrote on 2 March, in what would turn out to be one of her final messages. \"But when they see determination in your eyes, they will wish strength, thank you, and ask you to be careful.\"\n\nTwo days later, Yalanska, Kuzmenko and Ustymenko were killed when a missile strike from a nearby Russian tank slammed into their car. It is unclear whether the strike that day was a deliberate attack, but Russian troops had by that time grown indiscriminate in their missile targets. Airstrikes regularly blew apart residential buildings, offices, and essential infrastructure, in what Ukrainian officials claim was a policy designed to terrorise the population into defeat.\n\n\"They were killed for nothing,\" says Vlad Kytaigorodskii, a friend of the trio and a director at Ukraines largest poultry producer, MHP, speaking eight months later on a video call from the western city of Lviv. \"They were just giving out food, animal feed and necessities for toddlers and little children. Now theyre dead.\"\n\nFor the past nine months, newspaper front pages around the world have documented the impact of the Ukrainian war on global food supplies. A combination of blockaded Black Sea ports, mined farmland, and the destruction of one in six grain stores by Russian bombing, according to The Conflict Observatory in September, has all contributed to the worst food security crisis since the 2008 financial meltdown.\n\nBut inside Ukraine itself, the fight to keep the countrys 43 million people fed rages on. If a country cannot eat, it cannot survive. A fact all too present in the minds of the Ukrainian people, who have suffered extensive and severe strikes on supermarkets and food and drink factories. The regularity of attacks on the food chain have led Ukrainian and European officials to accuse Russia of weaponising food as a tactic of war, with EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski claiming Russia wanted \"to create hunger and use this as a method of aggression\".\n\nToday, there are effectively two Ukraines when it comes to food. In Russian-held areas, the mass closure of stores and factories mean many residents are unable to find basic necessities and are left widely reliant on aid. By contrast, in Ukrainian-held regions, following immense disruption in the initial months of the war, supply chains have adapted to the extent that most food supplies are readily available.\n\n\"Most of the drivers risked their life every day for months to bring those goods\" Vlad Kytaigorodskii, director at MHP\n\nThat doesnt mean there arent supply obstacles. Logistics, for example, continues to hamper many organisations. Huge tracks of infrastructure have been destroyed by Russian bombing including 6,300km of railway lines and 41 railway bridges in damage that will take several years to repair, Oleksandr Kamyshin, CEO of Ukrainian Railways, said last month.\n\nRoads too are in disrepair with 23,000km of tarmac destroyed, the equivalent of 14% of the countrys entire network, according to the State Road Agency of Ukraine. All in all, the damage to Ukraines transportation infrastructure is now estimated to total over $31bn, according to researchers at the Kyiv School of Economics.\n\n\"The biggest challenge has been logistics,\" says Mykola Melnyk, CEO of SantaVita, Ukraines biggest trader of dried fruit. \"From Kyiv to Dnipro [a journey of 465km] there were 67 checkpoints with necessity to stop, provide documents for the cargo, and pass all the inspections. It greatly affected us.\"\n\nDodging bullets\n\nFor some drivers, checkpoints were just the beginning. Through the spring, lorries regularly returned to depots peppered with bullet holes having run an unbridled gauntlet of danger. \"Most of the drivers risked their life every day for months to bring those goods to little cities where people were waiting,\" says Kytaigorodskii.\n\nFortunately, it was not long before a better option emerged. After learning that Russian troops were using decades-old maps to plan their attacks, drivers began working with local residents to find alternative ways to bring food and water into towns and cities. For what the Russians didnt know, explains Kytaigorodskii, is that most of the people in Ukraine have \"secret paths\" that are not mentioned on the main maps, in many cases running out of sight through forests or alongside fields.\n\n\"Where its very dangerous to deliver food on the main road because you have soldiers and you can be trapped and killed, theyd use these secret roads or trails. So just knowing some local people helped a lot with the deliveries,\" he says. \"We were like partisans.\"\n\nThe secret paths proved invaluable but were just one of many adjustments taken to keep Ukraine fed. The closure of Ukraines Black Sea ports, for example, means food arriving by sea must now find other routes in, with importers often turning to Polands Baltic seaports before bringing it in on road via the western border.\n\nThe destruction caused by Russian strikes is not just limited to roads and rail, of course. Heavy attacks on industrialised areas mean almost two in three companies have suffered losses over $1m, according to a survey by the European Business Association.\n\nSome of the most intense shelling has hit Kyiv, forcing businesses such as Snak Trade, a Ukrainian biscuit producer, to relocate its factory, find new suppliers, and train new employees. \"The most difficult thing was to find a space that would meet the requirements of food production without huge investments in repairs,\" says director Taya Grygorieva.\n\nAnd its not just Ukrainian businesses affected. A Mondelez Oreo factory in Trostyanets burnt to the ground in April, while its crisp factory near Kyiv was closed until June due to serious damage. And AB InBev ceased beer production at its three Ukrainian breweries in Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv, while a Donetsk brewery joint-owned with Efes was seized by Ukrainian separatists. \"Ive lost many ex-colleagues since this started,\" adds ex-CEO & president of Central & Eastern Europe Stuart MacFarlane. \"Its so sad and so tragic.\"\n\nSupermarkets too have fallen into the crosshairs of Russian forces, with all the major chains, from the Ukrainian owned ATB-Market and Silpo through to international chains like Spar, suffering damage. \"This is not an isolated incident,\" said Michael Horowitz, head of intel at security and risk management consultants Le Beck International, after an attack on a shopping centre. \"Russia is systematically destroying food depots [and] grocery shops.\"\n\nFozzy Group, the largest supermarket chain in Ukraine, lost over 60 of its 700 stores. Dmytry Tsygankov, Fozzys director of product development, summarises the retailers position during the early months of the war. \"Supermarkets were closed, some due to the danger to our staff and guests. Supply chains were ruined. Warehouses were blocked or bombed. So even in those supermarkets that still worked, we couldnt get stuff in.\"\n\nThe pressure only grew as queues built outside stores, people desperate to stock up on essential goods for fear of future shortages. Across the country, people reported having no access to fruit, vegetables, bread and other basic supplies. Many pet shops also ran out of food.\n\n\"Russia is systematically destroying food depots and grocery shops\" Michael Horowitz, head of intel at Le Beck International\n\nAt that stage, all of Ukraine was shaking, with many food producers and manufacturers shutting down completely either due to their facilities being destroyed or, like Snak Trade, simply due to the danger such attacks posed. As a result, Fozzys stores, which include Silpo supermarkets and Fora convenience stores, lost around a third of its 2,000 food and drink suppliers, Tsygankov estimates, a major toll on a supermarket that sources about 80% of its products domestically.\n\nWhile Silpo has found 500 new Ukrainian suppliers during the war that managed to continue production, it has often been forced to look abroad to make up for the shortfalls in domestic supply.\n\n\"Imports are more stable and, apart from some difficulties at the border, are a good back-up,\" says Tsygankov. \"If anything goes wrong with the local supplies, we can change it to imports. But of course, the locals are cheaper because the logistics are simpler.\"\n\nSome Ukrainian manufacturers have benefited by picking up new business. Others, however, are furious at the lengths some retailers have gone to to keep their shelves stocked. \"Some of the retailers have no principles on the presence of goods produced by the aggressor country,\" says Andriy Zadvornyak, commercial director at Wiener Kaffee, one of Ukraines largest coffee producers. \"For some reason, they still prefer imports rather than supporting the domestic manufacturer.\"\n\nThe good news is that empty shelves in Ukrainian-held regions are a rarity these days, with supply chains strong enough to ensure bananas, lemons and fresh meats are even available in the recently liberated city of Kherson. The bigger issue is unemployment. With the countrys unemployment rate now at 34%, according to the National Bank of Ukraine, many are struggling to afford food even when it is available.\n\nUnemployment\n\n\"People dont have money because theres whole industries that have closed,\" says Malachy OConnor, a partner at retail consultants IPLC, who has worked with Ukrainian companies.\n\nThe Ukrainian government is making \"considerable efforts\" to keep up its benefits payments through digital technologies, according to the UNs International Labour Organization, but with huge sums going to the army, social expenses are under pressure.\n\nAs a result, aid organisations are having to step in, with the International Rescue Committee, for example, distributing money to vulnerable people, typically as three-monthly payments of about $70. Similarly, the UNs World Food Programme, the worlds largest humanitarian organisation, has distributed $370m in cash to more than two million people across Ukraine.\n\nBut rising food prices are exacerbating the problem. Inflation hit 36% in October compared with the same month the year before, the highest reading since January 2016, mainly driven by skyrocketing prices of eggs (81%), vegetables (79%) and fruits (63%), according to the State Statistics Service of Ukraine.\n\nIn Russian-held cities such as Mariupol and Donetsk, the situation is more severe. With nearly all Ukrainian supermarkets closed, residents can only shop at Russian retailers, selling Russian products. And thats assuming they have Russian rubles. In any case, it didnt matter what the Russian supermarkets stocked, for many they wouldnt shop there regardless. \"Out of principle, I didnt carry any rubles and never bought Russian goods,\" Kherson resident Nataliia Tsvihun told Reuters last month.\n\nInflation is also rife, with some Ukrainians reporting on social media that a 1.5-litre bottle of drinking water that used to cost 15 Ukrainian hryvnia is now upwards of 50 hryvnia.\n\nSo when Kherson was finally liberated last month, queues gathered outside an ATB store decked in Ukrainian flags and blue and yellow balloons, awaiting the moment they could shop in a Ukrainian supermarket for the first time in almost nine months. For many locals, it had been nine months without their favourite Ukrainian foods like pickled gherkins or dumplings, as well as popular international brands like Coca-Cola.\n\nAntoine Vallas, head of communications for the World Food Programme in Ukraine, says that when the aid group went into Kherson for the first time last month, \"we found empty supermarket shelves and communities in desperate need of nutritious food, water and other essentials, having not received humanitarian assistance for months\".\n\nA major factor has been the disruption to supply chains caused by suppliers and transporters suspending operations due to the security risks. Initially, says Vallas, this made it difficult for the aid charities to buy enough food locally, but now with the frontline more stable it has become easier to work with local bakeries and other domestic suppliers.\n\nAid is in high demand. The war in these regions has ravaged much of the local economy, leaving around 18 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UNs World Food Programme. In some regions almost half the people are without enough food. And with winter setting in, the situation could be set to deteriorate further. Temperatures usually drop to 20C in much of Ukraine, meaning many families will have to spend more on heating and buying clothes. Aid groups fear this will reduce their ability to afford food.\n\nWater and malnutrition\n\nFor some, however, money is only half the problem. The UNs Food & Agriculture Organization said in July that \"shortages of infant formula and clean water are likely contributing to increases in acute malnutrition in the worst-affected areas\". Indeed, the destruction of water infrastructure in cities like Mariupol \"has placed the entire urban population at risk of cholera and other water-borne communicable diseases\", the organisation said.\n\nAgain, the situation on water is far from accidental. Much like in Syria, Russia is accused of targeting the water infrastructure like pipes and pumping stations, while also blockading water supplies for local populations in cities such as Mariupol, which was under siege before finally falling to Russian troops in May. During the siege, the EUs foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, and commissioner for the environment, Virginijus Sinkevicius, accused Russia of \"using the threat of dehydration to force the surrender of their city\".\n\nBut the threat to water supplies is not just in occupied regions. In October, 80% of Kyivs residents were left without water after Russian missiles hit plants and dams, according to Vitali Klitschko, the citys mayor. While supply of clean drinking water was restored last week, it is still not at full capacity.\n\nMost supermarkets still have bottled water but for those who cant afford it, queues often build up as residents wait to fill bottles from water tankers. AB InBev has also repurposed its patched-up breweries, where possible, to provide water (while also shipping in supply from other breweries in cans).\n\nAid charities across Ukraine are battling with the scale and complexity of the logistics needed to transport and distribute food and water to the many hundreds of small cities around the country. Of the 18 million people in need of aid, the World Food Programme estimates it reached 2.8 million in September, though it hopes this will soon scale up to 4.7 million per month.\n\n\"Out of principle I didnt carry any rubles and never bought Russian goods\" Nataliia Tsvihu, Kherson resident\n\nIn some cases, they have turned to those with established logistics networks already in place, typically food companies. Silpo, for example, created a new depot in Poland to receive donations, using its logistics network and store estate to distribute aid to the Ukrainian people.\n\n\"Its a huge logistics story,\" says Tsygankov when asked about the difficulties inhibiting aid. \"You have lots and lots of small towns so how to distribute it, how to transport it, its not easy.\"\n\nIn regions that aid charities struggle to reach, Silpo has distributed their certificates which can be cashed in for food at its stores. \"We have the logistics. They know people who they want to give aid to.\n\nSo thats another way of operating the aid,\" Tsygankov adds.\n\nIts terrifying\n\nAs much as Ukraine has adapted, the situation on food supply is set to get even harder, with Russias systematic bombardment of Ukraines Soviet-era power system meaning civilians are facing the prospect this winter of life without electricity, heat or running water.\n\n\"Put simply, this winter will be about survival\", said Hans Henri P Kluge, regional director for the World Health Organization, at a press conference last week, adding the coming months could be \"life-threatening for millions of Ukrainians\".\n\nHalf of Ukraines energy infrastructure is either damaged or destroyed, with 10 million people now without power.\n\nFor the countrys food supply, it is perhaps the greatest test to date. \"Its very hard [for Russia] to take out the supply of food into supermarkets. But the threat to energy is terrifying,\" says Tsygankov, not long before his wi-fi drops in the latest power outage.\n\nWithout electricity, fresh food can no longer be transported. Water can no longer be pumped. Millions of Ukrainians cannot cook. While local authorities have set up \"invincibility centres\", where people can warm up and get hot drinks, at one such centre in Kyiv last week, \"more than 60 children are waiting for food and we cannot prepare anything unless the power gets fixed,\" a woman told Reuters last week.\n\nFood businesses are racing to do everything they can to keep their operations moving. Silpo has adjusted its logistics chain so fresh food is now transported to stores more frequently and time spent in warehouses is minimised. It has also turned off all electric signs and non-essential fridges (beer can no longer be bought chilled), while turning to diesel generators to keep the ones that are still running cold. The retailer is also planning for a worst-case scenario in which stores must run entirely on these generators, which Tsygankov concedes would be \"very, very hard\".\n\nIt is the latest stage in what has been a relentless nine months keeping the country fed, and there is little respite for those on this alternative frontline. \"People call it challenging. I think of it as swimming against the current in sulphuric acid,\" Tsygankov chuckles. His spirit, like all of Ukraines, seems indomitable. \"Its fine. Were operating, were in business. Were just going to keep going.\"",

All times EST.\n\n11:15 p.m.: A court in Norway acquitted Andrei Yakunin, son of a former close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was charged with flying a drone over Svalbard despite a ban, his lawyer said Wednesday, according to AFP.\n\nYakunin, 47, was arrested in October and accused of using drones during a trip to the Arctic archipelago last summer aboard his Firebird luxury yacht.\n\nHe is the son of the former head of the Russian Railways, Vladimir Yakunin, who is sometimes described as a confidant of Putin.\n\nNorway has banned Russian citizens and organizations from flying over its territory following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a rule that also applied to the use of drones.\n\nBut the Nord-Troms og Senja court ruled \"Yakunin did not commit a criminal act,\" his lawyers said in a statement.\n\n10:30 p.m.: A lawsuit in Britain against Russian private military contractor Wagner could help Ukrainians seek reparations for alleged crimes committed during Russia's invasion, a lawyer whose firm filed the suit said on Wednesday, Reuters reported.\n\nJason McCue said the lawsuit initiated in Britain's High Court last month on behalf of alleged Wagner victims would target what Kyiv says are the group's global assets and aim to tie Moscow up in courts.\n\nOther suits would follow, with the intention of damaging Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"war machine,\" he said.\n\nWagner representatives could not be reached for comment.\n\n9:02 p.m.: Western officials are in talks with Turkish counterparts to resolve oil tanker lines off Turkey, a British Treasury official said, after the G-7 and European Union rolled out new restrictions on December 5 aimed at Russian oil exports.\n\n\"The UK, U.S. and EU are working closely with the Turkish government and the shipping and insurance industries to clarify the implementation of the Oil Price Cap and reach a resolution,\" the official told Reuters. \"There is no reason for ships to be denied access to the Bosporus Straits for environmental or health and safety concerns.\"\n\nU.S. officials did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nThe G-7 group of countries, the European Union and Australia have agreed to bar shipping service providers like insurers from helping export Russian oil unless it is sold at an enforced low price, or cap, in a bid to deprive Moscow of wartime revenue.\n\nBut a separate Turkish measure in force since the start of the month has caused a logjam, requiring vessels to provide proof they have insurance covering the duration of their transit through the Bosphorus strait or when calling at Turkish ports.\n\nAt least 20 oil tankers continue to face delays to cross from Russia's Black Sea ports to the Mediterranean as operators race to adhere to the Turkish rules.\n\n8:10 p.m.: An alleged Russian intelligence agent was charged with violating U.S. sanctions and money laundering by purchasing two condominiums in Beverly Hills, California, and concealing his involvement, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said on Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n\nAndrii Derkach, who is at large, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in September 2020 for being an active Russian agent for over a decade and for assisting the Kremlin's efforts to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election.\n\nThe indictment unsealed on Wednesday said that since 2013 Derkach has used overseas accounts in Latvia and Switzerland belonging to companies registered in the British Virgin Islands to pay for the purchase and maintenance of the properties.\n\nDerkach has previously denied wrongdoing and said he has been targeted for exposing corruption. He could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe charges come as the U.S. Department of Justice seeks to use criminal charges and asset seizures targeting wealthy and powerful individuals linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin to pressure Moscow to halt its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n7:22 p.m.: Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko on Wednesday dismissed criticism by Ukraine's president about his office's preparations for a winter of Russian air strikes, Reuters reported.\n\nKlitschko was chided by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in one of his nightly video addresses to Ukrainians last week, when he accused city authorities of failing to provide enough shelters despite the energy system being pounded by Russian attacks.\n\nOfficials are rolling out special \"heating points\" to provide people with warmth and electricity in case Russian missile strikes on critical infrastructure cause sweeping blackouts.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Klitschko responded to the accusations by saying Kyiv had considerably more heating hubs than any other city in Ukraine.\n\nKlitschko, in his ninth year as mayor, was seen as one of Zelenskyy's highest-profile opponents before Russia invaded Ukraine\n\n\"I am convinced that politics is behind this, because representatives of one political group began to run around trying to find faults (in Kyiv),\" he said.\n\n6:34 p.m.: The EU's executive arm on Wednesday proposed imposing sanctions on Russia's armed forces, three banks and scores of officials, in the latest salvo from Brussels against the Kremlin's war on Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"Russia continues to bring deaths and devastation to Ukraine. It is deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. \"But we stand by Ukraine, and we will make Russia pay for its cruelty.\"\n\nThe EU so far has imposed eight waves of sanctions on Russia since it launched the full-scale invasion in February, including targeting its key oil exports.\n\nEU ambassadors were to start discussing the new, proposed package late Wednesday. The agreement requires unanimity of all 27 member countries.\n\nVon der Leyen said the EU would now look to add \"almost 200 individuals and entities\" to its visa ban and asset freeze blacklist, including military officers, ministers, and defense firms.\n\nThe commission was also proposing sanctions on three additional banks, including the Russian Regional Development Bank.\n\n6 p.m.: A convicted felon suspected of firing at Russian police with a machine gun in a region bordering Ukraine has been detained, investigators said on Wednesday, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nSeparately, a Telegram channel close to Russia's security services said the 38-year-old suspect was a member of the Wagner mercenary group whose forces have been at the forefront of Moscow's offensive in Ukraine.\n\nThe man has been detained in the village of Kiselyovo in the southern Rostov region bordering Ukraine, said the Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes.\n\nThe man is suspected of shooting at police officers with a machine gun and injuring one of them in the city of Novoshakhtinsk on Tuesday, investigators said.\n\n5:21 p.m.:\n\n4:34 p.m.: Vitalii Kim, the head of the Mykolaiv Regional Military Administration, said Wednesday that the Armed Forces of Ukraine have all entrances to the Kinburn Spit under their control, disabling any supplies by Russian forces to that territory. Kinburn Spit is the last piece of land in the Mykolaiv region still occupied by Russian forces, according to VOAs Anna Chernikova in Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces remain on the Kinburn Spit despite the recent liberation of part of the Kherson region and the city of Kherson by the Ukrainian army.\n\nUkrainian military officials previously confirmed that the goal of the Ukrainian forces is to liberate the Mykolaiv region completely. They also confirmed that the military operation for the liberation of the Kinburn Spit is ongoing but said no further details would be provided until its completion.\n\n3:57 p.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday hailed the annexation of Ukrainian territories as a major achievement and said his countrys nuclear weapons serve as a tool of deterrence in the war that the Kremlin calls a \"special military operation,\" The Associated Press reported.\n\nSpeaking with members of the presidential Human Rights Council, Putin described the land gains as \"a significant result for Russia,\" noting that the \"Sea of Azov has become Russias internal sea.\" He added that \"Peter the Great fought to get access to the Sea of Azov.\"\n\nRussia seized broad swaths of southern Ukraine in the opening days of its invasion of Ukraine and captured the key Sea of Azov port of Mariupol in May after a nearly three-month siege. In late September, Putin illegally annexed four regions of Ukraine: Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south, and Donetsk and Luhansk in the east.\n\nAsked by a member of the Human Rights Council to pledge that Russia would not be the first to use nuclear weapons, Putin demurred, saying Russia would not be able to use nuclear weapons at all if it agreed not to use them first and then came under a nuclear strike.\n\n3:15 p.m.: The European Union on Wednesday proposed travel bans and asset freezes on almost 200 more Russian officials and military officers as part of a new round of sanctions aimed at ramping up pressure on Moscow over its war in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe proposals were made by the EUs executive branch, the European Commission. They must still be debated and endorsed by the 27 member countries, a process that routinely results in the commissions suggestions getting watered down.\n\nThe targets of the latest recommended sanctions include government ministers, lawmakers, regional governors and political parties.\n\n2:30 p.m.: Serhiy Mak said he spent 25 days locked in the cellar of an office building in Kherson, southern Ukraine, where he was tortured by a Russian man nicknamed \"The Specialist.\" Mak spoke to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty after Ukrainian forces liberated the city from Russian occupation.\n\n1:55 p.m.: Canada and the Netherlands have filed a joint declaration of intervention in Ukraines genocide case against Russia at International Court of Justice (ICJ), the countries said in a joint statement on Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Canada and the Netherlands avail themselves of the right to intervene in this case ... in order to place their interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention) before the court,\" the countries said in the statement.\n\n1:40 p.m.:\n\n1:25 p.m.: Kyiv's mayor warned on Wednesday of an \"apocalypse\" scenario for the Ukrainian capital this winter if Russian air strikes on infrastructure continue but said there was no need for residents to evacuate now, though they should be ready to do so, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Kyiv might lose power, water, and heat supply. The apocalypse might happen, like in Hollywood films, when it's not possible to live in homes considering the low temperature,\" Mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\"But we are fighting and doing everything we can to make sure that this does not happen,\" the former boxer went on to say, raising his booming voice to drive the point home.\n\nEven so, the picture is bleak: the capital lacks enough heated shelters to take in all 3.6 million residents in the event of completes outages and people should be ready to evacuate if the situation worsens, Klitschko said.\n\n1:10 p.m.:\n\n12:50 p.m.: A Russian military officer who illegally crossed into Kazakhstan because he objected to the invasion of Ukraine has been detained there, his family said, leaving Kazakh authorities with a diplomatic dilemma over whether to hand him over to Moscow, Reuters reported.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Russians fled to Kazakhstan and other neighboring states after the war started. Many of them were civilians, crossing legally as they sought to avoid a Russian mobilization order.\n\nAs an army officer, Major Zhilin, 36, was barred from leaving Russia and he illegally crossed into Kazakhstan in September when it became clear he could be sent to Ukraine, his wife Yekaterina told Reuters.\n\nShe travelled to Kazakhstan legally with their two children.\n\n\"As someone who disagrees with the actions of the Russian leadership with regards to Ukraine, I could not legally leave Russia even if I had resigned from military service because I am barred from doing so as a person who has access to classified information,\" she quoted him as saying.\n\n12:35 p.m.: Soviet-era T-72 tanks are getting new optics, armor, and more at a Czech facility in Sternberk, thanks in part to the efforts of Ukrainian refugees working there. Some 150 people have been hired by Excalibur Army in the effort to modernize old military equipment from around the world, which is shipped to Ukraine after months of work on upgrades. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n12:20 p.m. A Russian woman was among more than two dozen suspects detained in Germany on Wednesday during nationwide raids on an extremist group linked to the Reichsbuerger movement that allegedly aimed to overthrow the government, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nAccording to German prosecutors, the detained Russian citizen is suspected of facilitating unsuccessful attempts to make contact between a would-be group leader and Russian officials.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Berlin has denied any links with the group, while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the arrests an internal issue for Germany.\n\n12:05 p.m.:\n\n11:45 a.m.: Russian shelling killed at least six people and set buildings ablaze in the town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Zelenskyy's office, put the death toll higher. He said eight people had been killed and five wounded in the attack, in which a market, bus station, petrol stations and residential buildings came under fire.\n\n\"Terrorists attacked the peaceful town of Kurakhove, Zelenskyy wrote on the Telegram messaging app under video footage of buildings in flames. \"Terrorists are inhuman. And they will be held to account for it.\"\n\nKurakhove is in the Donetsk region, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting since Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24.

We have not encouraged them to do that,\" John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday, after apparent Ukrainian drone strikes on two airbases deep inside Russia, Reuters reported.\n\n\"When we give them a weapons system, it belongs to them. Where they use it, how they use it, how much ammunition they use to use that system, those are Ukrainian decisions, and we respect that,\" he said.\n\nHe said the United States has had conversations with Ukraine about accountability of weapons systems and made clear U.S. concerns about escalating the war. \"But in the end these are Ukrainian decisions that they have to make.\"\n\n11 a.m.: NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday said \"Russia is trying to freeze the conflict\" in Ukraine, in order to \"regroup and launch a bigger offensive later on because Ukraine now has the momentum.\" He was speaking at a Financial Times Global Boardroom event via video link, according to a NATO statement.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine would decide on the timing and subject of any negotiation with Russia. \"The more we want a peaceful solution, the more urgent it is that we provide military support to Ukraine,\" he added.\n\n10:50 a.m.: A Ukrainian priest from a church affiliated with Russia has been sentenced to 12 years in prison after being found guilty of assisting Russians, the Prosecutor General's Office said on Wednesday.\n\nUkraine's government has been tasked with drawing up a law on banning churches affiliated with Russia under moves portrayed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as necessary to prevent Moscow being able to \"weaken Ukraine from within,\" Reuters reported.\n\nThe priest, from the eastern Luhansk region, was not named and could not be reached for comment.

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs shared a video on Twitter Wednesday showing teams packing food and livelihood assistance to be delivered to Ukrainians in need of help.\n\n10:10 a.m.: A series of suspicious packages sent to Ukrainian embassies all bore the address of a Tesla car dealership in Germany and were usually sent from post offices without video surveillance, Ukraine's foreign minister said on Wednesday.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Facebook that 31 Ukrainian missions in 15 countries had received such packages in what he called a \"campaign of terror against Ukrainian diplomats,\" according to Reuters.\n\nUkraine, which has been invaded by Russia, said last week \"bloody packages\" containing animal eyes had been sent to some of its missions in Europe, soon after a letter bomb detonated at its embassy in Spain and police defused others sent to, among others, Spain's prime minister.\n\n10 a.m.:\n\n9:45 a.m.: The United States has not seen evidence that Iran has transferred ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine, the White House said on Wednesday.\n\nJohn Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, told reporters the United States has seen the continued provision of Iranian drones to Russia, according to Reuters.\n\n\"We know that their defense industrial base is being taxed,\" Kirby said of Russia. \"We know they're having trouble keeping up with that pace. We know that he's (Russian President Vladimir Putin's) having trouble replenishing specifically precision guided munitions.\"\n\n9:30 a.m.: Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Wednesday that the Russian war in Ukraine is damaging the environment and killing wildlife. He posted a video on Twitter by United24media which reports on some of the ecological damage done.\n\n9:10 a.m.: President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would fight to defend its interests using all available means, Reuters reported.\n\nPutin was speaking at a televised annual session of his Human Rights Council where he complained that Western rights organizations viewed Russia as \"a second-class country that has no right to exist at all.\"\n\n\"This is what we are dealing with,\" Putin said. \"There can be only one answer from our side - a consistent struggle for our national interests.

The governor said an oil storage tank had gone up in flames but there were no casualties.\n\nOn Monday, Russia said it had been hit hundreds of kilometers from Ukraine by what it said were Soviet-era drones at Engels air base, home to Russia's strategic bomber fleet, and in Ryazan, a few hours' drive from Moscow.\n\nUkraine did not directly claim responsibility for the strikes but nonetheless celebrated them.\n\n2 a.m.:\n\n1:30 a.m.: China's trade with Russia grew at a slower pace in November, as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, global recession risks and strict COVID restrictions in some Chinese cities weighed on demand abroad and at home, Reuters reported.\n\nShipments of Chinese goods to Russia rose 17.9% year-on-year in dollar terms, slowing from 34.6% in October, but still marking the fifth monthly double-digit growth in a row, according to Reuters calculations based on Chinese customs data on Wednesday.\n\nImports from Russia soared 28.5% in November from a year earlier, slower than the 36% gain in October, as COVID-19 flare-ups and related curbs weighed on domestic demand.\n\nShipments of Chinese goods to Russia have maintained double-digit growth since July, as Russian imports from the European Union contracted under a raft of sanctions.\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang in a video conference on Monday told his Russian counterpart the two countries should steadily advance cooperation projects in key areas and step up their economic and trade cooperation.\n\n1:10 a.m.: The United States military is studying the rate of munitions used in Russias war in Ukraine to ensure that the Pentagon is accurately calculating the weapons it would need in case of any future conflicts or operations, the top U.S. general said on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n\nWestern officials have said that Russia has depleted a significant proportion of its precision-guided ammunition in its invasion of Ukraine and its industry cannot produce all of the kinds of ammunition and weapon systems because of Western sanctions.\n\nUkraine, which is being armed by Western countries, is also using artillery and other types of munitions at a rapid rate.\n\nThe United States military has contingency plans for potential conflicts around the world, that include how many troops, pieces of equipment and munitions could be required.\n\n\"We are going through a study, an analysis right now, to ensure that our war plans, our contingency plans, which we have multiples around the world in different theaters, to make sure that weve done the right math, the right estimates,\" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said at an event.\n\n12:30 a.m.: The National Bank of Ukraine announced on Tuesday that the country had $27.95 billion in foreign reserves as of December 1, Reuters reported.\n\nThat figure topped the $27.42 billion in state coffers on the morning of Russias February 24 invasion of Ukraine, the bank said in a statement.\n\nIt also said its reserves had grown 10.7% in November.\n\n12:25 a.m.: The U.S. Congress is now considering the White Houses request for $38 billion in additional support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia aggression. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Senator Jim Risch say they believe the aid will be approved in the coming weeks.\n\nThe two senators have been strong supporters of aid to Ukraine, part of bipartisan congressional support that, if the latest appropriation bill passes, will deliver more than $100 billion in aid to Ukraine this year.\n\nThe senators sat down with VOA Georgian Services managing editor Ia Meurmishvili on November 30 to discuss U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia, and the likelihood that Congress will continue backing Ukraine in 2023.\n\nShaheen said the lessons from World War II are still relevant in the context of Ukraine, and the West must stop Russia before it invades other countries in Europe. On providing arms to Ukraine, Risch said the U.S. should not engage in self-deterrence out of concern that Russia may escalate the war. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin should instead be thinking about how to avoid U.S. escalation.\n\n12:15 a.m.: The U.S. State Department has approved a potential sale of 116 M1A1 Abrams tanks, other vehicles and munitions to Poland in a deal valued at up to $3.75 billion, the Pentagon said on Tuesday, Reuters reported.\n\nThe sale comes just months after Poland was authorized to buy 250 M1A2 tanks. With this new option, Poland could elect to buy a mix of the two tank versions as it seeks to modernize its military and adjust to new geopolitical realities following Russias invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe package would include vehicles to recover disabled tanks, eight assault bridges and other vehicles. It would also provide thousands of rounds of advanced munitions including armor-piercing rounds, spares and technical support, the Pentagon said.\n\nDespite approval by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that a contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded.\n\n12:05 a.m.: Polands defense minister said Tuesday that his country will accept a Patriot missile defense system that Germany offered to deploy to Poland last month, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe German offer was made after an errant missile fell in Poland near the border with Ukraine, killing two Polish men. Poland and NATO have said they believe it was a Ukrainian missile that misfired as the country was protecting itself from a missile barrage on November 15.\n\nPolish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak had initially said that he accepted the offer, but the leader of Polands powerful ruling party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said he thought the Patriot system should be placed in Ukraine.\n\nOn Tuesday, Blaszczak said on Twitter he was sorry Germany did not want to place the Patriot system in Ukraine. But that German and Polish defense ministries were proceeding \"with arrangements regarding the placement of the launchers in Poland.\"\n\nAn opinion poll published this week showed significant support by regular Poles for having the German rocket launcher located in Poland, where it will beef up defenses already enhanced by Poland and the United States since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine on February 24.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

There were no immediate reports of casualties. Credit Credit... Laura Boushnak for The New York Times\n\nKYIV, Ukraine Russia attacked Ukraines capital, Kyiv, before dawn on Wednesday with a swarm of 13 Iranian-made drone, most of which were shot down by Ukrainian air defenses, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe morning attack on the capital followed similar strikes on the Black Sea port of Odesa over the weekend that seemed to end a weekslong pause in Russias use the weapons.\n\nTwo government buildings in Kyiv and at least four homes in the region surrounding the capital were damaged, officials said, but it was unclear whether they were hit by direct strikes or falling debris from drones shot out of the sky. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine praised the air defense systems in a brief video message published on the Telegram messaging app and said that all of the drones appeared to have been shot down.\n\nKyiv and other parts of Ukraine have been subject to Russian missile attacks that have taken out power and other infrastructure as the country heads into the cold winter months.\n\nKyrylo O. Budanov, the head of Ukraines military intelligence agency, told Ukrainian media in October that Russia had used about 330 Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in the war against Ukraine, of which 222 had been shot down.\n\nMr. Budanov said Russia had ordered about 1,700 drones, which were being delivered in batches of 300 at a time. It was not possible to independently verify the claims, but they correspond with estimates from Western officials and military analysts.\n\nThe first sound that Yaroslav Vinokurov, 24, heard Wednesday shortly before 6 a.m. was the wailing of the air-raid alarm in the darkness. He continued to get ready for work, given that alarms sound nearly every day. But soon machine-gun fire echoed through the Shevchenkivskyi district as air-defense systems flashed in the sky, followed by what he described as \"a very loud explosion.\"\n\n\"I lay down on the floor, as I didnt know what else can happen,\" Mr. Vinokurov said. Only once it was quiet did he go outside.\n\nThe roof of a nearby government building was damaged, and debris littered the area. \"My car is destroyed,\" he said, looking over the damage.\n\nResidents rushed to put sheets, blankets and whatever else they could find onto damaged windows to protect themselves from the bitter cold. It was 23 degrees Fahrenheit well below freezing when the sun rose about 7:50 a.m.\n\nJust two days before the strikes, Yurii Ihnat, the spokesman for Ukraines Air Force, warned that Russian forces were now using attack drones at night. If the drones are launched during the day, he said, Ukrainians can use large-caliber machine guns and other small arms to shoot them down. But in the darkness, they need expensive and limited air defense missile systems that can track the incoming drones by radar.\n\nEven in the darkness, residents of the capital have become familiar with the sounds of Russias unrelenting aerial bombardment.\n\nMaria Varenikova and Victoria Kim contributed reporting.",

                "cc_text": "Whats new? Western governments backing Kyiv in the Russo-Ukrainian war must wrestle with four persistent questions: what is the risk Russia will use nuclear weapons? Can diplomacy at this stage help end the war? Would a ceasefire right now be welcome? Could a change in Russias government bring peace? Why did it happen? After its massive assault on Ukraine, Moscow has stumbled in the face of unexpectedly successful resistance, but it fights on. It has claimed to annex new Ukrainian territories, drafted hundreds of thousands, rhetorically brandished nuclear weapons and attacked energy infrastructure. Still, enabled by Western support, Kyiv has the upper hand. Why does it matter? Western powers see Russias efforts to conquer territory and achieve other goals through aggression and nuclear menacing as threatening their interests as well as Ukraines. They believe the dangers of accepting Russian aggression outweigh the hazards of continued conflict including the low but non-negligible risk of nuclear use. What should be done? The West should continue backing Ukraine while keeping NATO outside the conflict. Pushing for talks or a ceasefire before the parties are ready to compromise would be fruitless. Ultimately, Russia and the West should negotiate new security arrangements, but at present diplomacy will be most helpful in managing the wars repercussions.\n\nI. Overview\n\nIn late February, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, transforming a simmering eight-year conflict into a hot war that has forced millions of Ukrainians from their homes and upended Europes security order. Confounding expectations, and reinforced by military and economic support from Western powers, Ukraines resistance has forced the Kremlin to revisit its goals. As Russian forces struggle, Moscow has proclaimed annexation of new territories; mobilised hundreds of thousands more troops; launched massive attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure; and reminded the world of its nuclear weapons capacity. Thus far, however, little suggests it can turn the tide. Western policymakers wrestle with tough questions about the costs and risks of supporting Ukraine. But the fundamentals remain unchanged: for all the horrors of continued war, Russian subjugation of Ukraine would be more perilous for global peace and security. NATO capitals should maintain support for Kyiv, avoid direct conflict with Moscow and convey to the Kremlin the benefits a settlement acceptable to Ukraine would bring. Nine months after Russias 24 February assault, near-term prospects for peace are gloomy. Both Ukraine and Russia insist that peace will come only if the other party concedes. Kyiv, understandably, wants Russian forces to leave all of Ukraine, including Crimea and territory held by Moscows proxies in the eastern Donbas region since 2014 and 2015. It also wants the Kremlin to drop its unilateral claim to having annexed Ukrainian land. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated that he finds the Kremlin an impossible counterpart and signed a decree ruling out negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, although he has since stated that Kyiv is open to negotiations on Ukraines terms. Moscows position has become harder to read of late, though realistically it holds out little hope for a settlement any time soon. Russian officials say they are willing to negotiate. But they reject Ukraines terms, and offer neither concessions nor explicit proposals, as they fire barrages of missiles at Ukrainian power plants. Ukrainians across the country are facing chronic electricity and water outages as a result. Militarily, Kyiv has the upper hand, but not yet a guaranteed victory, much less a rapid one. It has made territorial gains in the east, during a September counteroffensive, and in the south, including the November liberation of Kherson, the regional capital held by Russian troops since early March. It has also flexed its muscles with long-range attacks on Crimea and Russia proper including early December strikes on the Engels and Dyagilevo air bases, hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border that revealed gaps in Russian reconnaissance and air defences. But Kyivs capacity to wage war hinges upon a steady supply of ammunition and weaponry from the West, whose support remains steadfast, though some in Western capitals do perhaps have an eye on costs and dwindling stocks. Ukraine still struggles at times to ensure that all forces are adequately equipped, with territorial defence and national guard units most often reporting shortages, including of winter gear. At the same time, little suggests Russia can prevail. The Kremlin reacted to Ukraines rebound by mobilising some 300,000 men into the army, most with seemingly scant preparation. Comparable numbers, at least, have fled the country for fear of being conscripted. Moscow has also launched a blitz of Ukraines energy infrastructure, aimed at weakening its morale as winter deepens. In early December, President Putin appeared to recognise that Russia was in for a long struggle.\n\nMost troubling are Moscows consistent reminders to Kyiv and the West of the risks of escalation.\n\nMany of Russias other moves seem geared to unsettle. It deployed several thousand soldiers and substantial gear to Belarus, whence Russia launched offensives into Ukraine in February. Moscow could perhaps attack again from there, but its combat-ready troop strength (about 30,000, when added to that of Belarus) is matched by Ukraines deployments on the other side. Most troubling are Moscows consistent reminders to Kyiv and the West of the risks of escalation, invoking its own nuclear capabilities, accusing Ukraine of planning to use a \"dirty bomb\" and raising worries about a false flag operation. In late October, President Putin appeared to walk some of those threats back, though in early December, he warned the risk of nuclear war was rising, while suggesting that Russia was all too cognisant of the danger. The upshot is that the battlefield remains bitterly contested. The Kremlin appears to be banking on its partial mobilisation to contain further Ukrainian offensives as winter cold, soggy weather and mud complicate operations for both sides. Having lost Kherson, Moscow may expect Ukraine to try cutting off the land bridge of captured Ukrainian territory that connects Russian-held areas of Donbas and Russia proper to the annexed peninsula of Crimea. By moving its most capable forces east of the Dnipro river, it looks to be digging in though some of those units have reportedly gone to Donetsk to fortify Russias forces there.If, as fighting continues, Russias troops have trouble holding the line, Moscow could decide to escalate further, with another draft, even wider attacks on civilian infrastructure or, possibly, at a last gasp though the risk remains low a nuclear strike. Alternatively, it could change its approach to negotiations. Against this backdrop, this briefing addresses four questions at the centre of policy debates in Western capitals. It focuses on the risk of nuclear escalation; the role diplomacy can play at this stage of the conflict; the possible utility of a ceasefire pending broader peace talks; and prospects that a change of government in Moscow might ease the path to peace. The answers, while hardly comforting, should shape Western policy: The risk of nuclear war, while still low, is real enough and must be carefully managed. Still, it is not a persuasive argument for allowing Russia to achieve its objectives through aggression and nuclear menacing. As things stand, the precedent created by making major concessions to Russia would be more dangerous than continuing war. The risk of nuclear confrontation would, however, spike dramatically if NATO were to enter the conflict directly. Both sides need to take care to avoid this outcome.\n\nCalls for diplomacy to end the war need to be tethered to reality. The West, and Washington in particular, should keep the door open to talks. They should continue to make sure that Kyiv does not set impossible preconditions; avoid regime change rhetoric that would deter Kremlin engagement; and signal that a reasonable peace will lead to sanctions relief. Both Kyiv and the West should continue to look for areas where cooperation can blunt the wars effects for example, prisoner exchanges, efforts to sustain and extend the deal that provides safe passage for Ukrainian grain across the Black Sea, and arrangements to manage nuclear safety risks at Ukraines Zaporizhzhia power plant. But calling for peace talks when both parties see more to gain on the battlefield, and neither is ready to compromise, is almost certain to be fruitless.\n\nFor similar reasons, a ceasefire is not on the cards right now. With both parties still believing they can fight their way to a better position, each would demand ceasefire terms the other sees as untenable.\n\nThe likelihood that a new guard comes to power in Russia and brings the conflict to an end is low. The Russian state is too powerful, the opposition too weak and avenues for pressure on the Kremlin too scant for this prospect to be anything on which to base planning. Certainly, trying to force change from the outside would be counterproductive and dangerous. For as long as these fundamentals hold, Western governments should keep providing Ukraine with what it needs to repel Russias invasion. The war is exacting a terrible toll on Ukraine and wreaking havoc on the global economy and, to some degree, world affairs. But NATO powers have judged that to support the grinding fighting in Ukraine, and even bear a small risk of nuclear escalation, is a better choice for them and for the world than clearing the way for Russia to prevail through a brutal military campaign and nuclear menacing. Their calculation is that these costs and risks are the necessary price of preserving Ukraines sovereignty as well as international peace and security. That calculation is a tough one to make: to some degree, it unsettles other parts of the world. It certainly requires continuous revisiting. At some point, the logic may change, pursuant to events on Ukraines battlefields and in Russia itself. For now, though, it is the right approach.\n\nII. How Likely is Nuclear War?\n\nFor all the suffering the Ukraine war has brought, the most terrifying prospect, at least for audiences far from the front, is that Russia uses nuclear weapons, triggering a confrontation with NATO. At the extremes of discourse about this possibility in the West are two arguments: one that Western backing for Ukraine has set the world on an escalatory spiral that will all too likely end in nuclear war; the other that the West should offer greater support, because Russia is bluffing, has no intention of going nuclear and will back down in the face of Western resolve. While the Kremlins calculations are opaque, making it impossible to know for sure, the best assessment almost certainly lies between these extremes. Nuclear war remains unlikely because both NATO states and Russia fear it. But it is not out of the question that, if all else fails, the Kremlin might gamble on a nuclear strike. The best course is thus neither to end Western backing in essence, caving in to nuclear blackmail nor to dramatically increase it. Western capitals should, in other words, prudently manage the escalatory risk inherent in their support for Ukraine.\n\nA. Playing the Nuclear Card\n\nThe primary reason that the nuclear threat has been so central to media and analytic coverage of the war is that the Kremlin has made it so. Russia ushered in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine with a reminder to Kyiv and the West of its nuclear arsenal and the possibility that it might use a weapon. On the day of the invasion, Putin warned Western states of \"consequences such as you have never seen\" if they were to \"stand in our way\". Moscows nuclear signalling grew even more unnerving in September. Putin wove comments about nuclear weapons, and Russias willingness to defend its \"territorial integrity\" with \"all the systems available to us\" through his announcements of mobilisation and plans to annex some or all of four Ukrainian regions partially occupied by Russian forces. The seeming intimation was that Moscow was threatening to use nuclear weapons in response to Ukraines efforts to liberate its own territory, now claimed by Russia. Shortly thereafter, in October, top Russian officials introduced a new angle to the narrative of nuclear peril by sharing what seemed like an entirely concocted set of concerns about Ukraine. They relayed to the UN Security Council and the defence ministers of the U.S., Trkiye, the UK, India, China and France that Moscow believed Ukraine planned to use a \"dirty bomb\" on its own territory. Russias interlocutors dismissed these claims prima facie, as there is no evidence of Ukraine having the capacity, much less the will, to do anything of the sort. But Moscows allegations did raise fears that it might be laying the groundwork for nuclear use against Ukraine, in retaliation for a false flag action.\n\nRussia would resort to nuclear use only in accordance with its military doctrine \"to protect its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and to ensure the safety of the Russian people\".\n\nBy the end of that same month, Putin seemed to walk back some of Russias threats and posturing. Speaking at the Valdai discussion club, he indicated that his past comments about nuclear use had been intended to unnerve, and said he saw no reason, as yet, for anyone to use nuclear weapons. He also said that Russia would resort to nuclear use only in accordance with its military doctrine \"to protect its sovereignty [and] territorial integrity, and to ensure the safety of the Russian people\". Putins statements went only so far in reassuring, however, in part because they could be taken as a departure from the very nuclear doctrine he cited. The countrys 2010 and 2014 published doctrines state that Russia would use nuclear weapons \"in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies\" or in the event of conventional aggression if \"the very existence of the state is in jeopardy\". Its most recent military doctrine, issued as a joint, \"union government\" doctrine with Belarus, offers no conditions for nuclear use, but states that Russian nuclear weapons \"will remain an important factor for preventing\" both nuclear and conventional conflicts. Other doctrinal documents spell out conditions of use that include threats to Russias nuclear deterrent forces, but also speak of using nuclear threats for deterrence ie, to convince adversaries to back down. Putins Valdai speech deviated from these formulas, although in some cases one could imagine that the Kremlin might view threats to territorial integrity as tantamount to threats to \"the very existence of the state\". On 7 December, President Putin returned to the nuclear theme. In widely publicised remarks to Russias Presidential Human Rights Council, Putin warned that the risk of nuclear war was rising and said he viewed Russias nuclear arsenal as primarily deterrent, even if remaining somewhat evasive on his precise nuclear policy, and also noted that \"Russia has not gone crazy\". In other words, his goal was seemingly to convince the world that Moscow was not the one threatening nuclear war while again reminding his foes about Russias nuclear weapons.\n\nB. Global Reactions\n\nWestern states have responded to Russias comments with their own deterrent rhetoric, although the pitch has varied. After Putins 24 February comments, Frances foreign minister noted that the Russian president \"must also understand that the Atlantic alliance is a nuclear alliance\". Elizabeth Truss, the United Kingdoms prime minister from 6 September to 25 October, said when campaigning for the role that she was willing and \"ready\" to use nuclear weapons if needed, though she did not explicitly invoke the war in Ukraine. (Putin subsequently referred to her remarks explicitly in his as evidence that he was not the one brandishing nuclear weapons). The U.S., meanwhile, says nuclear use by Russia would lead to \"catastrophic\" consequences, the specifics of which, according to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the White House has directly communicated to Moscow. Washington has been publicly circumspect about whether and under what circumstances the U.S. would answer with force placing it in direct conflict with Russia, with all the attendant risks or turn to a range of other measures that might include cyber operations, economic responses and delivery of heavier weaponry to Ukraine. Russias partners in Asia have also urged Moscow to exercise restraint. Perhaps most importantly, China called on international actors to prevent a nuclear crisis on the continent. According to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, \"the international community should jointly oppose the use or threats to use nuclear weapons, advocate that nuclear weapons must not be used and nuclear wars must not be fought, in order to prevent a nuclear crisis in Eurasia\". India stated clearly that nuclear weapons should not be used by any side in the Russo-Ukrainian war. Despite the generally wide variance in views around the table, the G20 took a strong line on this issue in its declaration at Novembers summit in Indonesia: \"The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible\".\n\nC. Assessing the Risk\n\nDespite the disastrous consequences the use of nuclear weapons would incur including for Russia itself Moscow might, if unhindered by formal doctrine, see several rationales for a nuclear strike. Some Russian officials reportedly believe, despite all the Wests warnings, that Ukraine and its Western backers would back away from further escalation in the face of Russian nuclear use. If the leadership follows this logic, Russia might consider using nuclear weapons, especially if it senses that defeat on the battlefield is looming and, with it, the chance of domestic upheaval. Hyperbolic as it may sound, Putins propagandists often suggest that Armageddon is worth risking in service to a global mission of Russian greatness. The Kremlin might also judge, particularly in the face of major military setbacks, that it needs to make good on its threats, for the sake of credibility and absent other options. Moscow might also believe it can convince enough people that it is responding to a radiological threat from Ukraine and thus escape global opprobrium. The risk of Russian nuclear use would become far more acute were NATO to confront Russia directly. Most Western capitals appear to understand this danger all too well, given their caution in avoiding steps that edge too close to escalation, including their rejection of a no-fly zone after Russias all-out invasion and their measured response to reports of a missile strike in Poland on 15 November. If Russia were directly at war with NATO, it could conclude that the states very existence was threatened, which is the central scenario for use of nuclear weapons that its doctrine contemplates. Such a war might not immediately threaten core state functions (eg, an attack on the seat of government in Moscow) or Russias nuclear deterrent and capacity to retaliate. But because Moscow probably expects that in any such war, NATO would seek to limit Russian nuclear capabilities, the Kremlin might see these capabilities to be at risk in a range of situations that are difficult to anticipate. It might then launch pre-emptive nuclear attacks to demonstrate resolve or to use its weapons before a U.S. counterforce strike decimates them.\n\nA nuclear strike would not help Russia attain its goals.\n\nFor now, though, it seems highly unlikely that Moscow would gamble on a nuclear strike. Even leaving aside the international outrage, including in non-Western capitals, that doing so would provoke, there are strong practical reasons to eschew such tactics. Put simply, a nuclear strike would not help Russia attain its goals. Indeed, nuclear use would serve no tactical military purpose. While the fear, destruction and mayhem that even a \"smaller\" weapon (ie, one roughly half the size of the bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki) could wreak would be enormous, no crucial bridge can be destroyed, or road rendered impassable, only by using a nuclear weapon. Conventional explosives can be used to the same effect without the enormous risks to Russia itself that would be associated with nuclear use. Even beyond the likelihood of provoking a Western response, these risks include the possibilities that radiation blows into Russia, harming people there, or drifts into Europe, forcing an even greater escalation than might otherwise be the case. Consistent with this logic, Moscow has stayed strictly conventional over the nine months of war, despite its travails on the battlefield and despite attacks on Russian territory as well as on Ukrainian lands that Russia claims as its own, large swathes of which Ukraine has now liberated. Western officials are reportedly aware that Russian authorities have considered their nuclear options, but also say they have seen no evidence that Moscow has prepared or is preparing to use nuclear weapons. Moreover, militaries generally consider all sorts of options in the midst of war planning, so it is difficult to know whether the reported discussions were significant. Meanwhile, the Kremlins increased tempo of strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure horrific in their own right and conscription of hundreds of thousands of men suggest that it plans to keep its escalation conventional, at least for now. Perhaps the strongest argument that the risk of Russian nuclear use remains low is that Russia appears to be counting on its sabre rattling in part to deter direct conflict with the West. Russian behaviour thus far pairs nuclear menacing with the reality that, even as weapons for Ukraine are delivered from NATO territories, Moscow has not struck any targets outside Ukraine. Despite its rhetoric, Moscow, like its NATO counterparts, has thus far steered clear of actions that could draw alliance members directly into the war and trigger a wider, even global conflagration. Its actions suggest that it, like NATO capitals, hopes to avoid direct NATO-Russia confrontation, seeing the dangers such conflict would bring. It might seem something of a paradox that Moscow, in attempting to keep NATO out of the war, is threatening to do precisely the thing that would run the gravest risk of NATO getting more directly involved. Nonetheless, the Kremlin appears to see deterrent value in such threats.\n\nD. Nuclear Menacing and Its Audiences\n\nDeterrence is likely not the only purpose behind Russias nuclear menacing. As with its large-scale bombing of Ukrainian energy and civilian infrastructure, Moscow also appears to hope that it might frighten Ukrainians into abandoning resistance and the West into stopping support for Kyiv. In that sense, the tactic has played differently to different audiences. For Ukraine, which understandably sees the present conflict as existential, regardless of whether it is fought by conventional or nuclear means, the threats are largely ineffective and have perhaps even lost punch over time. For Kyivs Western backers, they are more salient. Violating the nuclear taboo after 75-plus years would be a seismic shock to global security, even before one considers the immediate humanitarian consequences, the possibility of radioactive fallout in Europe and the risks of catastrophic escalation that it could portend. Western officials, for the first time in decades, have had to seriously grapple with the question of how they would respond to a nuclear strike by Moscow. But even in the West, Moscows threats appear to be backfiring. While the nuclear menacing has likely strengthened the voices of those urging caution about direct intervention in the conflict, it has not bolstered arguments for ratcheting back support and, in some respects, has undermined them. At least among policymakers, Russias use of nuclear threats raises the stakes for backing down. They worry that any apparent weakening of support for Ukraine would smack of giving in to nuclear blackmail, which could embolden Moscow into believing that it can throw its weight around in a similar way beyond Ukraine. Some European officials now argue that, due in large part to the Kremlins nuclear threats, the war is existential not just for Ukraine, but also for their countries, which could be threatened in the future. This logic has its limits. Russia does not necessarily have the same designs on other states that it has on Ukraine. Plus, even if Moscows threats fail in Ukraine, it may still try the tactic again, there or elsewhere. Still, if it succeeds in Ukraine, the odds of more such menacing are surely higher.\n\nWestern governments are right to maintain support for Ukraine, while simultaneously steering clear of long-understood thresholds.\n\nBroadly speaking, then, Western governments are right to maintain support for Ukraine, while simultaneously steering clear of long-understood thresholds such as direct NATO involvement in the conflict and deterring Russia from nuclear use. The White House, although making clear that it has communicated to Russia how it would respond to a nuclear strike, remains tight-lipped about those plans, at least in public. But it may well have conveyed that nuclear use would have precisely the consequences that both sides have sought to avoid, pulling NATO into a confrontation that, even if conventional at first, would run a grave risk of going nuclear. Western leaders should also continue to encourage statements, like the G20 leaders declaration in Indonesia and those of China and India, in which non-Western countries make clear their opposition to nuclear weapons use.\n\nIII. Can Diplomacy End the War, and If So, How?\n\nNotwithstanding the bitterness the war has engendered, diplomacy among Russia, Ukraine and others has continued. In the build-up to the 24 February invasion, Western powers undertook a flurry of diplomatic efforts aimed at convincing Russia to sit down with its neighbours to negotiate a European security order that could better serve everyones interests. They also sought to reassure the Kremlin that they had no intention of admitting Ukraine to the NATO alliance, something that, despite not being on the cards prior to Russias invasion, Moscow had long described as a threat to its security. The efforts failed. Russias demands, which included a return to the pre-enlargement NATO force posture of the 1990s, were maximalist and unrealistic, but if they had been a starting negotiating position, talks could have ensued. Instead, rather than coming to the negotiating table, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Soon after the invasion, Ukraine entered into negotiations with its adversary. At first, Moscow demanded capitulation from Kyiv, which the Ukrainian government rejected. As Russias military was forced to withdraw from Ukraines north and centre, however, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators (peculiarly, especially in light of the growing role of women in Ukraines government and military, seemingly all-male on both sides) began to make progress. In particular, they agreed on specific parameters for Ukraines future neutrality an end state desired by Moscow and that Kyiv, at that point, was prepared to live with. But talks soon stalled. Moscow wanted Ukraine to withdraw forces from the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk which Russia recognised as independent states within their Ukrainian administrative boundaries on 21 February, even before it made additional military inroads into those territories and did not want to discuss the status of Crimea. Ukraine wanted Moscow to return to its positions of 23 February, as well as to postpone bilateral talks on the status of Crimea for fifteen years. The negotiations ground to a halt in late March, when atrocities, including summary executions, rapes and other torture, committed by Russian forces in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, came to light.\n\nTalks have continued ... seeking to address the wars consequences.\n\nOther talks have continued, however not concerning the core of a political settlement but seeking to address the wars consequences. Moscow and Kyiv make regular direct deals to exchange prisoners and remains of the dead. Other parties have helped facilitate some efforts notably, Saudi Arabia was a stopping point for Ukrainian prisoners of war returned from Russia, and it assisted, as did Trkiye, with repatriation of foreign nationals fighting for Ukraine who had been in Russian custody. A 22 July deal, brokered by Trkiye and the UN, to restart Ukrainian grain exports across the Black Sea, which provides a lifeline for Ukrainian farmers and global consumers and has helped facilitate Russian agricultural exports, nearly broke down in October, but quickly got back on track. It has now been extended for another 120 days starting on 18 November. Through its own diligent negotiations with both Moscow and Kyiv, the UNs nuclear watchdog agency has obtained access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to help ascertain the safety of the facility, where Russia holds the Ukrainian staff hostage and has established a military base. This record demonstrates the power of diplomacy to mitigate the damage of war, and even to end it, but also the need to ensure that expectations for what it can accomplish are realistic. Experience to date offers no reason to think that if the right formula, or the right mediator, is found, the conflict might end. To the contrary, as the discussion above shows, a wide variety of mediators have been engaged already. They have been valuable in mitigating the conflicts effects, and they, and many others, stand ready to help when peace talks become possible. But, no matter who the mediator, meaningful peace talks can take place only when Russia, Ukraine or both are prepared to compromise. Thus far, neither is. Kyiv is in no mood to offer concessions because it has continued to improve its battlefield position, in defiance of expectations of how it would fare. On 24 February, most analysts predicted that Russia would win a quick military victory in Ukraine. Some argued that Ukraine would resist, and that Russia would face an ugly fight, but these observers, too, judged Moscows military capability to be decisively superior to Kyivs. In practice, Russia proved to be far less capable than assessed, and Ukraine, backed by Western military and economic aid, has had Russia on the back foot for some time, disrupting first its plan of rapid conquest that would force regime change and then its effort to gain full control of Donbas. Moreover, after eight months of war, Russia is in even worse shape militarily than earlier on, having suffered heavy losses of equipment and personnel, including in its best-trained and most combat-ready units, and is now relying on weapons purchased from Iran. Some estimates hold that as much as half of the force that attacked on 24 February is dead, incapacitated or off the battlefield for other reasons. Ukraines long-range attacks on high value targets in Crimea and deep within Russia proper, including early December strikes on the Engels and Dyagilevo air bases (which host strategic bombers hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border), reveal gaps in Moscows reconnaissance and air defence.\n\nKyiv is confident that it is on a path to liberate ever more of its land.\n\nNow, the Ukrainian army, having taken Kherson city and made inroads in Luhansk region, is also spoiling Russias third war plan to gain and retain control of those territories that Moscow had declared annexed, even though it is only Luhansk that Russia ever had full control of (and that temporarily). Indeed, Kyiv is confident that it is on a path to liberate ever more of its land, especially since Russian troops have left Kherson, the only regional capital that they had been able to capture since February. Although winter weather and better-established Russian defensive positions may slow progress, Ukraine has little reason to expect major reversals. Even if his government wanted to cut a deal, Zelenskyy would struggle to find the political space to do it. He must answer to public opinion that is overwhelmingly opposed to any compromise with the Kremlin. September polling indicated that 70 per cent of Ukrainians wanted to keep fighting until victory, and over 90 per cent define victory as regaining all territory held by Russia, including Crimea. As more territory is liberated, reports of the suffering, including gender-based violence, that civilians are enduring under Russian occupation surely feed Ukrainians desire to regain control of their land. Moreover, although Ukraines elites are united behind the Zelenskyy administration, the countrys dynamic political scene has not disappeared, and opposition leaders would rapidly take action in the face of what they would see as appeasement of Russia. Kyivs leadership would likely not survive in power, and any deal it struck might prove less than durable, if it made fundamental concessions to Russia at this time. Russia, although complaining about Ukrainian unwillingness to negotiate, also is not in the market for compromise. Rather, Moscow appears to want only deals that cement its gains and, ideally, more: that is, to maintain its position in the south and east, if not take full control of all four territories that it claims to have annexed. For now, Moscow appears to calculate that devastating attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and reminders to Western states of the risks of escalation will combine with rising energy costs across Europe to shift dynamics in its favour. It may hope that the slim majority the Republican Party now enjoys in the U.S. House of Representatives, and particularly its faction that opposes aid to Ukraine, will erode political support for U.S. assistance. It no doubt expects erroneously but probably genuinely that if it can convince Ukraines Western backers to rethink their support, then Kyivs own calculus about staying in the war will change. Indeed, many in the Kremlin appear to still believe that Western states are forcing Ukraine to fight, even after months of evidence of Ukrainian agency. As for Kyivs Western backers, they have thus far judged that acceding to Russian coercion, and in particular nuclear menacing, would be fundamentally counterproductive to their own security interests. Of course, Western states are not a monolith, and debates continue, as exemplified by comments in November by U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley suggesting that Ukraine should seek negotiations to solidify its gains. But Milleys remarks were quickly countered by his civilian bosses. The prevailing consensus in Western capitals is that if they press Ukraine to negotiate, Russia will think they are driven by desire to end the war, even at great cost. Moscow might then not only seize the moment to press for recognition of its territorial claims, but also, as discussed above, be emboldened to more adventurism, in Ukraine and elsewhere. By way of background, on 11 November, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia was ready to negotiate with Ukraine without preconditions. On 14 November, Russias Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko clarified that Kyivs demand to withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory was unacceptable to Moscow as a precondition to starting negotiations. On 15 November, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said it was Ukraine that refused to negotiate, not Russia. On 1 December, Lavrov said Russia had never asked for negotiations but was ready to listen to proposals for talks. See \"MFA says ready for dialogue with Kyiv without preconditions\", RBC, 11 November 2022; \"The Russian foreign ministry found unacceptable the condition for the withdrawal of troops to start negotiations\", Radio Liberty, 14 November 2022; \"Ukraine refuses to negotiate, not Russia: What Lavrov said at the G20\", TASS, 15 November 2022; and \"Lavrov says Russia never asked for talks on Ukraine\", Interfax, 1 December 2022.\n\nEven if shifts in domestic politics or economic pressure were to bring about a change of heart in Western capitals ... the violence in Ukraine would not necessarily end.\n\nBesides, a withdrawal of Western support from Ukraine would hardly signal the end of the crisis. Even if shifts in domestic politics or economic pressure were to bring about a change of heart in Western capitals, which right now seems unlikely, the violence in Ukraine would not necessarily end. Nor would the region necessarily experience greater stability. While a Western about-face would greatly damage Ukraines war effort, and it might even change Kyivs cost-benefit calculations concerning negotiations, it would probably not make Ukrainian public opinion more conciliatory especially since, at this point, the Russian missile barrages do not seem to be weakening resolve. (An October survey found that 86 per cent of Ukrainians agree that their country should fight on in the face of bombardment.) There could also be other dangers to reducing support to Ukraine. Even if some Western states back away, others (particularly on Europes eastern flank) would strongly resist doing so, leading to discord within the European Union and the NATO alliance. If Russia subsequently were to act aggressively, in Ukraine or elsewhere, generating a new crisis, the states that had scaled down their assistance would be under tremendous pressure to show greater resolve the second time around likely creating even graver risks of escalation than those present today. Against this backdrop, the Western, and in particular U.S., approach to diplomacy is sensibly focused on risk mitigation and keeping options open. The White House has maintained a diplomatic channel between U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Kremlin counterparts Nikolai Patrushev (President Putins national security adviser) and Yuri Ushakov (his top foreign policy aide) to help both sides manage the risk of escalation. CIA Director William Burns met with the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergey Naryshkin, in Trkiye. At the same time, the U.S. has reportedly pressed Kyiv to stop insisting that the Putin government be removed from power as a precondition to peace talks. In so doing, Washington has signalled its discomfort with a posture that in effect makes peace talks impossible, while avoiding the suggestion that the time is ripe for such talks. So, under what circumstances might meaningful talks be feasible? Perhaps the most promising scenario a low-odds one but not completely implausible would see Russias demands change. If Ukraines battlefield success continues, Russia would have two options. One would be to escalate further, with more attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, additional mobilisations, more threats and (however unlikely) nuclear weapon use. The other would be to seek a ceasefire or peace talks. At least some interlocutors close to the Kremlin recognise that Russias resources are increasingly exhausted; that coercion and threats are not working; and that Russian forces appear unlikely to regain the upper hand on the battlefield. \"There is an understanding in the Kremlin that mobilisation will not enable a decisive victory over Ukraine\", a Russian expert close to the Kremlin told Crisis Group. If these views hold sway and the Kremlin leadership offers compromise of some sort (with details depending on battlefield dynamics), Western pressure on Ukraine to negotiate would rise. Ukraines government would also likely be more amenable, although domestic political dynamics would continue to limit what it could negotiate about. In the meantime, Western governments, while supporting Ukraine, can keep a door open to diplomacy aimed at ending the war, even if the moment now is not opportune. They should do all they can to help the Kremlin feel it can back away from the war without risking that its adversaries will try to foment its domestic collapse. They cannot, of course, guarantee Russias stability but they can try to make eventual deals with Ukraine more palatable, including, as Crisis Group has previously recommended, by dangling the prospect of easing the sanctions that have inflicted the most pain on ordinary Russians and reiterating that any peace deal would also require new security arrangements for the region as a whole, to reassure everyone, including Ukraine and Russia. To this end, recent statements by U.S. President Joe Biden, that he is prepared to speak with Putin if the latter sought to end the war, and French President Emmanuel Macron, that he would keep engaging with the Kremlin to mitigate wars effects, hit the right notes.\n\nIV. Could a Ceasefire Be a Positive Step?\n\nCalls for negotiations aimed at reaching agreement on a ceasefire abound in some corners of social media. But as with a broader deal, both Russia and Ukraine insist that an end to fighting is possible only if and when the other accedes to its demands ie, Ukraine withdraws from the territories Russia claims to have annexed (in Moscows case) or Russia withdraws from Ukraine (in Kyivs). Neither scenario is in the offing right now. At some point, if Russia continues to lose ground, it may be more interested in a ceasefire based on the battle lines then in place, but even that would not necessarily make such a deal a precursor to peace. From Moscows perspective, the point of a ceasefire would almost certainly be to buy time and space to rebuild its military capacity in preparation for new offensives and to pressure Ukraine for concessions in the meantime. While Ukraine would just as surely use the time the same way, it has little interest in quitting while it is ahead and giving Russia time to catch up. Furthermore, unless Russia is greatly weakened, it would likely demand ceasefire terms that include, at the least, recognition of its control of the territory it occupied at that time and limits on Ukrainian military activity and deployments. A Russian military expert told Crisis Group: \"The Kremlin wants to retain at least some of the territories it has annexed, and any ceasefire that guarantees this is now in Russias interest\". Accepting those terms would make no sense to Kyiv unless it, too, is facing real constraints on its fighting capacity. Again, as with a broader deal, Moscow may be counting on Western pressure to shift dynamics. But here as well, Kyiv would resist any such pressure. Western states, too, view the idea of seeking a ceasefire now as tantamount to giving in to Russias nuclear blackmail and setting the stage for more of the same an assessment that seems valid based on Russias behaviour to date. At a later point, it is not unthinkable that a ceasefire could pave the way to a broader deal. For now, though, even if new stalemates in the fighting are possible, there is little reason for either side to want to formalise them. Even were Western capitals inclined to push Kyiv toward a ceasefire and Ukraine less impervious to pressure, it is hard to imagine much upside to any ceasefire that might result under present conditions and easy to see the risks.\n\nV. Could Changing Russias Government Bring Peace?\n\nWhile, in theory, a change in Kremlin leadership might create opportunities for conflict resolution, in practice the war is unlikely to end due to pressure from inside Russia. It would be dangerous to try forcing such a change from the outside. A popular revolution is difficult to fathom. On an autocratic path even before its February offensive in Ukraine (Russia has not had free elections or competitive politics in over two decades), the Kremlin has cracked down even harder on dissent and the flow of information since 24 February, driving many opposition-minded citizens to flee the country. Putin and his inner circle control the security services, the media, elections, the courts and the economy. State-approved propaganda rules the airwaves, with independent voices available only via a reliable virtual private network (VPN), access to which can be difficult. No surprise, then, that opinion polls throughout Russia indicate support for the war and for the government. Although these polls are not reliable in a country where social media posts can draw prison time, they do offer evidence of unwillingness on Russian citizens part to express opinions critical of the Kremlins current direction. More dissent could emerge, though the odds are against it. For example, more Russians could lose their inhibitions as frustration grows with war and economic hardship, but even then, the Russian state is set up to prevent real opposition from finding expression. As of now, dissenters face a choice between leaving the country and prison. There are two exceptions. One is the freer rein given to those who support the war, but want it carried out more forcefully and viciously, and to see the forces better prepared. The second is the small wave of cross-national protests by mainly female relatives of the mobilised, complaining that their male kin are inadequately equipped and prepared. While they have faced roadblocks from officialdom, they have generally not been detained. Indeed, the Kremlin took this situation seriously enough to organise an audience with Putin for a group of wives and mothers. These, however, were a handpicked group of government workers and other loyalists. Those demanding an end to war and peace talks with Ukraine were not invited. Alternatively, it is possible that someone within the system would take over from Putin, perhaps even with his blessing were he, for example, to become ill though nothing suggests any such person emerging any time soon. In this case, peace could plausibly follow, simply because any new leader might need to free up resources otherwise tied up in the war effort in order to consolidate support. Thus far, however, though views of the war within Putins inner circle reportedly vary, its members seem to believe that they are better off supporting the current dispensation. \"They [Putins inner circle] may have different opinions on the war, but in the Russian political system it does not matter they will all do what Putin decides to do and no one will argue with him\", a political adviser of a Kremlin-connected Russian businessman told Crisis Group.\n\nA Western effort to overthrow the government is among the scenarios that Russias political and military leadership fear the most.\n\nNor is it clear exactly how Western states could act to effect a change of government, though all evidence suggests that even trying would carry tremendous danger. As noted above, a Western effort to overthrow the government is among the scenarios that Russias political and military leadership fear the most. Support for any group seeking regime change in Russia would feed the Kremlins sense that it is besieged by the West, increasing nuclear risks. If Russia is to change, it will in all likelihood have to change on its own from within which, again, appears unlikely to happen for now. While Western states and Ukraine may not be able to change Russia, they should stay true to their values and continue to engage with dissidents, championing their rights, and with exiles, offering safe haven to those who flee Putins increasingly dictatorial rule. Indeed, more openness to Russians could, over time, generate more support for better relations with the West or, at least, undermine the Kremlins arguments that the West is hostile to Russians.\n\nVI.

A report in the Washington Post said Ukraine needs another $2bn a month on top of the $55bn already projected for next year to meet basic expenses.\n\nThe head of Ukraines armed forces believes Russia will make a renewed attempt to capture the capital, Kyiv, after its attack earlier this year was repelled. In an interview with the Economist, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhny said he was trying to prepare for Russian forces having another go at taking the city, possibly in February or March.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Ukraines defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said its forces were preparing for Russia to launch a major offensive in the new year. Reznikov said that while Ukraine was now able to successfully defend itself against Russias missile attacks targeting key infrastructure, including the energy grid, evidence was emerging that the Kremlin was preparing a broad new offensive.\n\nUkraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an online address to the European Council that the next six months of the conflict would be \"decisive in many respects\".\n\nVladimir Putin said Russia would try to overcome the financial impact of sanctions by selling gas to its eastern neighbours. In a televised speech, he said Russia would develop its economic ties with countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\nKherson city was without electricity after heavy shelling, according to the head of the regional military administration. \"At the first opportunity, the power industry will begin to restore power grids,\" Yaroslav Yanushevich said on his Telegram account.\n\nA former Russian deputy prime minister who is one of the countrys wealthiest men is one of the latest people to be placed under sanctions by the US government for ties to Putin and the war. Vladimir Potanin has had restrictions placed on him because of his involvement in Interros, a conglomerate that works across several sectors including manufacturing, construction and finance.\n\nA Russian airbase in Kursk was struck on Wednesday night, a senior Ukrainian official said. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy, said an \"unknown drone\" struck the military facility.\n\nRussian shelling killed two people on Thursday in the centre of Kherson, a Ukrainian official said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidents office, said the two were killed about 100 metres from the regional administration building, which was hit in shelling on Wednesday.\n\nThe UN diplomat in charge of aid said it was unlikely the Black Sea grain deal would be expanded to include more ports or reduce inspection times. Kyiv has called for an expansion of the deal with Moscow, which allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of three Ukrainian ports. More than 14m tonnes of grain have been exported since the deal was agreed, the UN said on Thursday.\n\nUkrainian forces shelled the Russian-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk overnight, Russian-installed officials in the annexed areas said on Thursday. \"At exactly seven oclock this morning they subjected the centre of Donetsk to the most massive attack since 2014,\" Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-backed mayor of the city, said on Telegram.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Thursday that all weapons supplied to Ukraine by the west were legitimate targets for Russia, and that they would be destroyed or seized.\n\nEU member states failed to agree on a ninth package of Russia sanctions in talks late on Wednesday, diplomats said, as EU leaders gathered in Brussels on Thursday for their last summit of the year. Countries moved closer to a deal in Wednesdays negotiations but Poland and some other countries still have objections, one EU diplomat told Reuters, adding that a new draft was expected to be circulated on Thursday evening.\n\nTwo people were injured in continued shelling in the Nikopol area on Thursday. The governor of the Dnipropetrovsk oblast, Valentyn Reznichenko, said a 66-year-old man was being treated in hospital and a 67-year-old woman was being treated at home.\n\nRussias recent deployment of additional units of mobilised reservists to Belarus will be unlikely to constitute a force capable of conducting a successful new assault into northern Ukraine, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. On 13 December, Belarus carried out a \"snap combat readiness inspection of its forces\", the ministry notes in its latest intelligence report.\n\nThe UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Trk, said further strikes on Ukraines infrastructure could lead to a serious deterioration of the humanitarian situation and further displacement. In a speech to the Human Rights Council after a trip to Ukraine, Trk said Russian strikes were exposing millions of people to \"extreme hardship\".\n\nA UN senior official on Thursday voiced optimism that there would be a breakthrough in negotiations to ease exports of Russian fertilisers. \"I am cautiously optimistic that we can have important progress soon,\" Rebeca Grynspan said in Geneva.",

As a reaction to the international community marking a red line.\"\n\nDespite deep divisions, it was important that dialogue with the Kremlin continued, Germany's leader added.\n\n10:34pm: Russians may want negotiations only to have a pause to get new recruits trained, says Stoltenberg\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said it is not a good idea to engage with the Russians overtures towards negotiations and this chimes with what the Ukrainians are saying. Gulliver Cragg, FRANCE 24s correspondent in Kyiv, reports.\n\n02:06\n\n9:47pm: Ukraine conflict intrudes on UN biodiversity summit\n\nThe Ukraine conflict cast a shadow over a high-stakes UN summit on biodiversity in Montreal on Wednesday, as Western nations slammed the environmental destruction brought about by Russia's invasion.\n\nThe broadsides by the European Union and New Zealand which spoke on behalf of other countries, including the United States came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of \"ecocide\" and of devastating his country's dolphin population.\n\nRussia fired back that the meeting was an inappropriate forum and accused its critics of attempting to sabotage a new global deal for nature.\n\n\"The war brings about pollution and long-term environmental degradation, destroying protected areas and natural habitats,\" Ladislav Miko, an EU representative at the meeting, known as COP15, said.\n\n9:00pm: US slams 'loose talk' on nuclear weapons after Putin comments\n\nThe United States on Thursday denounced \"loose talk\" on nuclear weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would only use an atomic weapon in response to an enemy strike.\n\nDeclining to respond directly to Putin, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters, \"We think any loose talk of nuclear weapons is absolutely irresponsible.\"\n\n6:49pm: EU targets Russian armed forces, banks in new sanctions, says EU chief von der Leyen\n\nThe EU's executive arm on Wednesday proposed imposing sanctions on Russia's armed forces, three banks and scores of officials, in the latest salvo from Brussels against the Kremlin's war on Ukraine.\n\nEuropean Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would also look to curb supplies of drones to Moscow and take four more Russian \"propaganda\" channels off the air.\n\n6:43pm: Kyiv mayor brushes off Zelensky's criticism as 'politics'\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko on Wednesday dismissed criticism by Ukraine's president about his office's preparations for a winter of Russian air strikes, saying he believed it was driven by politics and that it looked \"strange\".\n\nKlitschko was chided by President Volodymyr Zelensky in one of his nightly video addresses to Ukrainians last week, when he accused city authorities of failing to provide enough shelters despite the energy system being pounded by Russian attacks.\n\nOfficials are rolling out special \"heating points\" to provide people with warmth and electricity in case Russian missile strikes on critical infrastructure cause sweeping blackouts.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Klitschko responded to the accusations by saying Kyiv had considerably more heating hubs than any other city in Ukraine.\n\n\"It looks strange when we are united against a single enemy, but we start to fight within the country,\" he said.\n\n6:42pm: Lawsuit against Russia's Wagner group seeks Ukraine reparations\n\nA lawsuit in Britain against Russian private military contractor Wagner could help Ukrainians seek reparations for alleged crimes committed during Russia's invasion, a lawyer whose firm filed the suit said on Wednesday.\n\nJason McCue, of McCue Jury and Partners, said the lawsuit initiated in Britain's High Court last month on behalf of alleged Wagner victims would target what Kyiv says are the group's global assets, and aim to tie Moscow up in courts.\n\n\"Together we can shake and peel this Russian doll until its hidden layers reveal that its treasure is for us to claim and to give to Ukrainians for justice,\" he told reporters in Kyiv.\n\n6:35pm: Canada, Netherlands to intervene in genocide case against Russia at ICJ\n\nCanada and the Netherlands have filed a joint declaration of intervention in Ukraine's genocide case against Russia at International Court Of Justice (ICJ), the countries said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"Canada and the Netherlands avail themselves of the right to intervene in this case ... in order to place their interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention) before the court,\" the countries said in the statement.\n\n4:33pm: Putin says Russia may be fighting in Ukraine for a long time, evokes risk of nuclear war\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that his army could be fighting in Ukraine for a long time, but he saw \"no sense\" in mobilising additional soldiers at this point.\n\n\"As for the duration of the special military operation, well, of course, this can be a long process,\" Putin said, using his preferred term to refer to the Russian invasion, now in its 10th month.\n\nIn a televised meeting of his human rights council that was dominated by the war, Putin said Russians would \"defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal\", asserting that Russia was seen in the West as \"a second-class country that has no right to exist at all\".\n\nHe said the risk of a nuclear war was growing the latest in a series of such warnings from Moscow but that Russia would not threaten recklessly to use such weapons.\n\n\"We haven't gone mad, we realise what nuclear weapons are,\" Putin said. \"We have these means in more advanced and modern form than any other nuclear country, that's an obvious fact. But we aren't about to run around the world brandishing this weapon like a razor.\"\n\nPutin says Ukraine war may be 'lengthy' 00:24\n\n4:05pm: Ukraine's Zelensky says at least six killed in Donetsk shelling\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday said that at least six people had been killed and five more injured in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\n\"Terrorists attacked the peaceful city of Kurakhove. A market, a bus station, gas stations, and residential buildings came under fire. At least six civilians were killed, five were wounded,\" Zelensky said in a statement on social media\n\n3:49pm: Putin says 150,000 mobilised Russians are deployed in Ukraine\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that half the Russians called up for military service in September have been deployed to Ukraine.\n\n\"Out of 300,000 of our mobilised fighters, our men, defenders of the fatherland, 150,000 are in the area of operations,\" the Russian leader said during a televised meeting of the Kremlin's human rights council, saying some 77,000 were in combat units.\n\n3:44pm: Zelensky accuses Russia of 'ecocide' over damage to wildlife\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday accused Russia of \"ecocide\" for the devastation he said its invasion has wrought on Ukraine's wildlife.\n\nThousands of dead marine mammals had washed up on the shore of the Black Sea, he said, including tens of thousands of dolphins.\n\n\"And this is only a small part of the devastating consequences,\" he added.\n\n\"The Russian war has a huge impact on the wildlife of our country,\" Zelensky added, denouncing Russia's \"ecocide in Ukraine\".\n\n3:34pm: Russia strengthens defence lines near Ukraine border\n\nThe governors of two Russian regions bordering Ukraine have said they inspected the construction of defence lines days after Ukrainian drone struck key military airfields.\n\nThe governor of the Kursk region, Roman Starovoyt, shared photos of pyramid-shaped concrete blocks that appear to be anti-tank fortifications.\n\nHis counterpart in the neighbouring Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, on Tuesday reported inspecting local fortifications \"to ensure the safety of all residents who live in the Belgorod region\".\n\n2:01pm TIME magazine names Ukraine's Zelensky 'Person of the Year'\n\nTIME magazine named President Volodymyr Zelensky as well as \"the spirit of Ukraine\" as its 2022 person of the year on Wednesday, for the resistance the country has shown in the face of Russia's invasion.\n\nCalling Zelensky's decision to remain in Kyiv and rally his country amid the ongoing war \"fateful,\" Time editor in chief Edward Felsenthal said this year's decision was \"the most clear-cut in memory.\"\n\nSince Russia's February 24 invasion, Zelensky has delivered daily speeches followed not only by Ukrainians but by citizens and governments around the globe.\n\nHe has appeared on the frontlines and recently celebrated in the streets of Kherson when Ukraine pushed Russia from the critical southern city.\n\n\"His information offensive shifted the geopolitical weather system, setting off a wave of action that swept the globe,\" Felsenthal wrote in announcing the winner.\n\nTIME's 2022 Person of the Year: Volodymyr Zelensky and the spirit of Ukraine #TIMEPOY https://t.co/06Y5fuc0fG pic.twitter.com/i8ZT3d5GDa TIME (@TIME) December 7, 2022\n\n12:55am: NATO chief says Russia trying to 'freeze' the war before spring assault\n\nRussia is looking to stall the fighting in Ukraine over the winter in order to build up its forces for a renewed assault next year, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has said.\n\n\"What we see now is that Russia is actually attempting to try to have some kind of freeze of this war, at least for a short period of time, so they can regroup, repair, recover and then try to launch a bigger offensive next spring,\" Stoltenberg told a public event hosted by the Financial Times.\n\nStoltenberg said NATO members were continuing their \"unprecedented\" supply of arms and support to Ukraine despite concerns that the conflict is draining Western stockpiles.\n\n\"As important as adding new systems, is to ensure that systems or weapons we have already delivered, are actually operational or working in an effective way,\" Stoltenberg said. \"Meaning that they need a vast amount of ammunition, spare parts and also maintenance.\"\n\n11:05am: Fears of new Ukraine front as Belarus moves military gear\n\nBelarus plans to move military equipment and forces over the next two days in what it labels a counter-terrorism exercise stoking fears that Russia may mount a new attack on Ukraine from the territory of its Belarusian ally.\n\n\"During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,\" the state BelTA news agency cited the country's Security Council as saying.\n\n\"The movement of citizens (transport) along certain public roads and areas would be restricted and the use of imitation weapons for training purposes is planned,\" the agency added, without specifying which parts of the country could be affected.\n\nBelarus has said it will not enter the war in neighbouring Ukraine, but President Alexander Lukashenko has in the past ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near the Ukrainian border, citing threats to Belarus from Kyiv and the West.\n\n10:35am: Soldiers among 16 killed in Donetsk road accident\n\nMore than a dozen people have died in a road accident in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, which is mostly controlled by Russian forces, the Moscow-installed region's head has said.\n\n\"A tragedy on the T-0517 highway claimed the lives of 16 people, among them were some of our defenders,\" the Russia-appointed head of Donetsk Denis Pushilin said on Telegram.\n\nFour other passengers were injured in the accident that took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, according to Pushilin.\n\nHe offered \"sincere condolences\" and wished a \"speedy recovery\" to the injured.\n\n8:45am: I thought of Russians as our brothers how could they commit such an abomination?\n\nThe city of Nikopol in southern Ukraine lies just across the Dnipro river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, exposed to daily Russian bombardment and unable to return fire.\n\nHome to 115,000 people before the war, Nikopol has lost more than half its population since Russian forces took over the nearby nuclear plant in the first days of fighting, placing their artillery units around the facility.\n\nUkrainian forces say they cannot return fire for fear of causing a nuclear disaster. And for those left behind in Nikopol, life in the city has become a misery.\n\nFRANCE 24s Robert Parsons, Pauline Godart and Raid Abu Zaideh spoke to residents of a gutted apartment block days after it was struck by Russian fire.\n\n02:45 An apartment building gutted by a Russian missile strike in the Ukrainian city of Nikopol. FRANCE 24 screengrab\n\n7:55am: Poland to place German Patriot missiles on its territory\n\nPoland is preparing to deploy the German Patriot air defence system on its territory, after Berlin refused to place this system in Ukraine, Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Twitter.\n\nGermany last month offered Poland the Patriot system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland. Polish Defence Minister later asked Germany to send the fire units to Ukraine instead.\n\n\"After talking to the German Defence Ministry, I was disappointed to accept the decision to reject Ukraine's support. Deploying the Patriots to the western Ukraine would increase the security of Poles and Ukrainians,\" Blaszczak tweeted on Tuesday evening.\n\n\"So we proceed to working arrangements for placing the launchers in Poland and connecting them to our command system,\" he added.\n\n6:05am: US lawmakers authorise $800 million in additional security assistance for Ukraine\n\nUS lawmakers agreed to provide Ukraine at least $800 million in additional security assistance next year, according to a defense policy bill unveiled on Tuesday.\n\nThe Fiscal 2023 National Defence Authorisation Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500 million over President Joe Biden's request earlier this year.\n\nThe overall bill authorises $45 billion more in defence spending than Biden requested, as congressional negotiators sought to address the effects of global inflation and provide additional security assistance for Ukraine.\n\n3:10am: Latvia revokes licence for exiled Russian TV channel\n\nLatvia announced Tuesday it was revoking the licence for exiled Russian independent channel Dozhd, or TV Rain, for multiple violations that included showing the annexed Crimean peninsula as part of Russia.\n\nThe channel, which moved to Latvia after Russian authorities blocked its broadcasts for critical coverage of the war in Ukraine, dismissed the accusations as \"unfair and absurd\", saying that it would remain on YouTube.\n\nThe network, which was founded in 2010 as the main opposition channel in Russia, is also accused of supporting Russian soldiers, which the channel denies, and failing to ensure Latvian language translation, the LETA news agency reported.\n\n12:35am: President Zelensky meets troops near eastern front\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited troops close to front lines in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday and expressed thanks to everyone involved in the war effort to mark the country's Armed Forces Day.\n\nAddressing servicemen later in the presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelensky said he had spent the day with troops in Donbas, theatre of the heaviest battles, and in Kharkiv region, where Ukrainians have retaken swathes of occupied territory from Russian forces who invaded more than nine months ago.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and Reuters)\n\nFrance Mdias Monde graphic studio\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

                "cc_text": "Residents of Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine scrambled for cover on December 5 as Russia launched another deadly barrage of missiles at the country after explosions were reported at two airfields in central Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said four people were killed in the attacks, but said Ukrainian air defense forces had been able to shoot down most of the missiles launched.\n\n\"Every Russian missile shot down is concrete proof that terror can be defeated,\" he said in his evening video address.\n\nUkrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat told RFE/RL earlier that Ukrainian air defenses were able to shoot down over 60 of the more than 70 missiles launched.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

Another 22 Kalibr missiles were fired from ships in Russia's Black Sea Fleet.\n\n\"We also have information on the use of Tu-22 M3 bombers with rocket launchers, which are the most powerful in terms of combat weight,\" Ihnat said. \"Guided air missiles were also launched from Su-25 fighters.\"\n\nAir-raid sirens lasted for three hours as officials warned people to take shelter.\n\nAndriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential office, told Ukrainians to heed the alarm. Reports on social media showed hundreds of people sheltering in subway stations in the capital, Kyiv.\n\nThe missile strikes injured one person in Odesa and hit energy infrastructure in the city, where all substations and backup lines were not working and where there is no water supply.\n\nIn Kryviy Rih in the Dnipropetrovsk region, critical infrastructure has been damaged and large-scale blackouts are possible, authorities said. Electricity was turned off as a precaution in the northern Sumy region, and possible disruptions were reported in the northern Chernihiv region and the western Ternopil region.\n\nZelenskiy said engineers had already started to restore electricity, and Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that, despite being hit by Russian missiles, Ukraine's energy system \"functions and will remain intact.\"\n\nJohn Kirby, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, condemned the latest Russian strikes, calling them a reminder of Russian President Vladimir Putin's brutality. The United States is in constant contact with Ukraine and will continue to provide Kyiv with everything it needs for its defense, Kirby said.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Twitter that he had a conversation with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on December 5 after the Russian missile strike. Reznikov said he and Austin discussed further steps to strengthen Ukrainian air defense and thanked the U.S. for its continued support.\n\nEarlier on December 5, at least one large explosion occurred at a Russian military air base in the Saratov region, about 600 kilometers east of Ukraine, while another blast was reported by Russian state media at an airfield outside Ryazan, southeast of Moscow.\n\nSocial-media posts by residents in the cities of Engels and Saratov seemed to show a large explosion at the Engels-2 air base at about 6 a.m. local time on December 5.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the attacks were carried out by Ukrainian drones. The ministry confirmed news reports of damage to two Tu-95 strategic bombers and the deaths of Russian servicemen. The ministry also claimed that both drones were shot down.\n\nUkrainian authorities have not publicly commented on the blasts, but a senior Ukrainian official quoted anonymously by The New York Times, said the drones were launched from Ukrainian territory and at least two planes were destroyed at one of the Russian bases and several more were damaged.\n\nThe latest volley of Russian strikes against Ukraine came the same day that a price cap of $60 per barrel imposed on seaborne Russian oil by the Group of Seven (G7) leading economies, the European Union, and several importing countries took effect.\n\nThe price cap, which has been joined by the United States, Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom, was intended to punish Moscow for its unprovoked aggression against neighboring Ukraine.\n\nIt stipulates that Russian oil can only be shipped to third countries using G7 or EU tankers, insurance companies, or credit institutions if the cargo is purchased at or below the price cap.\n\nThe EU has also introduced an embargo of seaborne Russian oil that also took effect on December 5.\n\nMoscow remained defiant over the move and said it would not recognize the restrictions.\n\nThe United States doesn't expect that Russia's threats to have any long-term impact on global oil prices, Kirby said.\n\nThe cap will lock in the discount on Russian oil, and countries like China and India will be able to bargain for steep price reductions, he said.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AP, and The New York Times",

                "cc_text": "The Russian shell that struck in the night had taken away the wall of a top-floor apartment, and in its place was just freezing air blowing off the Dnieper River and a view of Europes biggest nuclear power station on the other bank.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants silhouette with its two fat cooling towers and the row of six squat blocks has become globally familiar since it was dubbed the most dangerous place on Earth: six nuclear reactors on the frontline of a catastrophic war.\n\nA worker fixes up an apartment in a building hit by a Russian missile few days ago in Nikopol. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nOn a fairly typical night last week, the Russians on the left bank of the river fired 40 shells and rockets into Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-held right bank, falling on its rows of krushchevky, five-storey blocks of flats built for factory workers in the 1960s and named after the Soviet leader of the time.\n\nAfter 10 months of war, the blocks are half empty, so there are fewer people to kill. The only reported casualty on this particular night was a 65-year-old man who was taken to hospital, and whose flat now afforded such a comprehensive view of the power plant.\n\nBy the next morning, the repairs had already begun. An electrician restored power to the rest of the building, and two men were in the remains of the apartment itself, sweeping up and putting chipboard in place of absent walls.\n\nThere were four loud bangs as the Ukrainian army guns on the nearby riverbank opened fire on Russian positions and, a few minutes later, Nikopols air sirens sounded in anticipation of a Russian response, though none was forthcoming that morning.\n\nThe basements of the krushchevky have been turned into shelters with beds and school desks but most of the remaining population are so inured to bombardment, they just carry on with their day.\n\nThe Ukrainians insist they are extremely careful about what they shoot at, even when they receive fire from the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant. On Thursday, the Ukrainian nuclear power company, Energoatom, accused Russia of bringing Grad multiple launch rocket systems near reactor number 6, which is near the area of where spent nuclear fuel is kept. The likely aim, Energoatom alleged, was to shell Nikopol and the nearby town of Marzanets, using their position as cover.\n\nThe walls of the reactors are thick enough to withstand artillery fire, but a direct hit on the spent fuel containers could well lead to the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Since seizing control of the power station in March, the Russians have begun building a concrete shelter over the spent fuel, but Ukrainian officials say it is being done without following the normal international safety protocols.\n\nEarlier in the week, Russias defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine of \"nuclear terrorism\", saying its armed forces had fired 33 large calibre shells at the Zaporizhzhia plant over the previous two weeks. The most recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has four inspectors at the Russian-occupied site, said last Friday there had been no shelling of the plant since 20 November, although artillery fire had landed in the vicinity.\n\nPetro Kotin, Energoatoms president, claims that the bombardments of the area around the nuclear reactors are false flag attacks carried out by Russian occupation forces.\n\n\"They have two special trucks, which we know have mortars inside, which go into the forest and each time they go there, there is shelling around the plant,\" Kotin told the Guardian.\n\nDmytro Orlov, mayor of Energodar, says there are no Ukrainian forces in the areas from which shelling is coming. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nDmytro Orlov, the mayor of Enerhodar, the town next to the nuclear plant that is home to its workers, claimed there was additional evidence that the shelling was coming from the Russian side. \"You can hear the outgoing bang of the shooting and then the two or three seconds later the shell lands, so it is coming from very close and there arent any Ukrainian forces that close,\" Orlov said in an interview on the Ukrainian side of the lines in the city of Zaporizhzhia where he continues his duties in exile.\n\n\"My personal opinion is that this is to scare the local population so the Russians can tell them: \"You see were protecting you and its the Ukrainians who are shelling you.\"\n\nIt was not possible to verify Kotin and Orlovs accounts of the shelling, or the counter-claims from Moscow. Satellite imagery however, has confirmed that the Russian army is storing military equipment inside the plant.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The agency is negotiating the creation of a security no-fire zone around the reactors, but Kyiv is insisting Russia must first withdraw all its weapons and armour from the power station, something Moscow has not so far agreed to.\n\nMeanwhile there is a parallel safety threat from within the plant itself: the steady attrition of its workforce over the 10 months of the conflict. Many key workers have left because of the danger to their families or because they refused to work for the Russians. Of the 11,000-strong workforce before the full-scale invasion, just 4,000 are left. In an attempt to stop the exodus, the Russians have circulated lists of plant staff to all military checkpoints in the region with orders they are not be allowed to leave, but it has been too late to stop a major outflow.\n\n\"In some cases, theres only three people to cover a seven or eight-person shift,\" Orlov said. \"People dont have enough rest. It causes exhaustion.\"\n\nOperating under armed occupation adds to the stress. The workers still at the plant are under constant pressure to sign contracts with Rosatom, the Russian energy company, signifying acceptance of Moscows control.\n\nThe Russian invaders use threats against workers families to put pressure on them to carry on going into the plant, says Oleksii Melnychuk. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\n\"They take the workers aside one at a time, and the first question they ask is about the whereabouts of their families. They put pressure on through their family. One worker was questioned for eight hours,\" Oleksii Melynchuk, a former worker at the nuclear power plant, said. Despite that pressure, he said, only about 10% of the staff at the plant have signed Rosatom contracts.\n\nIn recent days, the Russians have deactivated the electronic passes of some of the workers who have refused to sign, reducing the pool of available reactor operators even further.\n\nMelynchuk said there were just enough staff left to maintain the plant in its current state of suspended animation, with all the reactors shut down, and two of them deliberately kept hot, to provide heating for Enerhodar.\n\nBut keeping reactors in this hot standby mode is a difficult and delicate process, adding to the burden on the operators. The situation could get worse still. The Zaporizhzhia plant is currently connected to the Ukrainian grid, but there have been times the transmission lines have been brought down by shelling, forcing the power station to fall back on diesel generators to keep the cooling system running and prevent the reactor vessel from meltdown.\n\nIf the connection to the grid was severed again, it would add to the pressure on the overstretched workforce and on the generators, which were only designed as a temporary backup. They will need maintenance and no one knows how much diesel fuel the plant has left. Once the diesel generators failed, meltdown would begin in a matter of hours.\n\n\"Those remaining at their posts are doing impossible things to keep the plant safe. They have proved their professionalism to the entire world,\" Melynchuk said. \"Even without the occupation, it would be very hard physically and psychologically to operate the station with the current staffing levels. But if you add the pressure from the occupiers, then it just gets harder.\"",

The river serves as a natural barrier, and Russia has built an enormous series of defensive obstacles south of the river to discourage Ukraine from crossing it.\n\nA map of Ukraine showing territory occupied by Russia, and where fortifications have been detected.

Or once they get there, not just keep running,\" Mr. Wasielewski said. \"These are just holes in the ground unless they are held by motivated, disciplined soldiers, who are supported by artillery, mobile reserves and logistics.\"\n\nTo better understand Russias fortifications in eastern Ukraine, The Times analyzed satellite radar data on physical changes to the earths surface. That data, along with high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet Labs, reveals multiple rows of Russian defenses lining major highways just behind the Russian frontlines.\n\nA map of defensive fortifications near the city of Popasna, in eastern Ukraine.

The new construction provides several defensible positions to retreat to, should the Ukrainians counterattack.\n\nThat could help Russia avoid a repeat of its costly withdrawal from the Kharkiv region in September, when it lost thousands of square miles of territory and was forced to abandon military equipment.\n\nOne network of Russian defenses near Popasna was constructed in just 11 days.

In a Telegram post on Dec. 6, Igor Strelkov, a Russian former intelligence officer, said the decision to build long-term structures had been made \"on a whim.\"\n\n\"Following the strategy of a protracted war is suicide for the Russian Federation,\" he said.\n\nWhile trench warfare is associated with the major wars of the 20th century, trenches and obstacles can still play an important role in modern warfare by shaping where an enemy can attack, said Ben Barry, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\n\"The whole idea of defensive positions is to get an advantage by being able to fight from prepared positions,\" Mr. Barry said.\n\nThe Soviets used these types of defenses to successfully defend against a German attack on the city of Kursk during World War II. Moscow views this as the model of a Russian defensive battle, Mr. Barry said.\n\n\"They knew the Germans were attacking there. So they built defenses in great depth and had many belts of obstacles and minefields and belts of defense and also powerful reserves,\" he said.\n\nBut trenches have modern weaknesses as well. Many of them are being built out in the open, within striking distance of Ukrainian artillery, making them especially vulnerable to being spotted by drones.\n\nConstructing these defenses so near to Ukrainian forces has very likely led to heavy Russian casualties near the town of Svatove in eastern Ukraine, Britains Ministry of Defense said in a statement.\n\nAn analysis published in late November by the Institute for the Study of War, an American research group, showed that Russia also built defensive positions deep in southern Kherson in October before it ordered a withdrawal from territory north of the Dnipro River.\n\nA map showing defensive structures built by the Russians in Kherson Oblast.

New structures have been spotted more than 50 miles from the Dnipro River, which now serves as a natural barrier between the two sides.\n\nMilitary experts said that Russia is likely moving to the defense in Kherson so it can redeploy forces to more active fronts in the war, such as Bakhmut.\n\nEven so, it is a signal that \"the Russian military leadership views the prospect of a Ukrainian counteroffensive across the Dnipro River as a serious threat,\" according to an assessment by the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nUkraine has already made an amphibious landing on a strategically vital peninsula at the mouth of the Dnipro River. Known as the Kinburn Spit, the peninsula could serve as a base for Ukrainian attacks deep into Kherson, so Russia has heavily fortified a two-mile-wide strip of land separating the spit from the mainland.\n\nNew fortifications in Kherson Novotroitsk Tarasivka Velyka Blahovischenka Novooleksiivka Source: Satellite images by Maxar Technologies, Nov. 15, 2022 The New York Times\n\nMany of the fortifications are designed to protect supply lines that connect southern Kherson to Crimea, the peninsula that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Losing even one of the two main highways \"would likely strain Russian logistics supporting operations\" in eastern Kherson and western Zaporizhia, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nDefensive positions can be seen every five miles on the major M14 highway that runs from Kherson to Melitopol, a city in the Zaporizhia region that Russia captured in the early days of the war.\n\nA satellite image showing a section of the M14 motorway with multiple fortifications built by the Russians.

Russia mobilized hundreds of thousands of fresh recruits in September, but many of them arrived on the battlefield poorly trained and unequipped.\n\nRussia has likely deployed these new recruits to frontline defenses in Kherson, saving more experienced troops for secondary positions, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War wrote late last month.\n\n\"Manning Russian frontline fortifications with these less effective, less organized, and poorly equipped and supplied personnel could lead to them collapsing or falling back faster than Russian military leadership may have planned,\" the analysts wrote.",

The award ceremony will be held Saturday.\n\n\"The logic of authoritarian leaders is very understandable: they see any attempt (at) dialogue as a sign of weakness.\"\n\nFounded in 2007, the group aims to document every single war crime committed across Ukraine.\n\nThis year's Nobel Peace Prize, the first since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, recognizes the efforts of civil society to stand up against authoritarian states and human rights abuses, the Norwegian Nobel committee has said.\n\n8:40 p.m.: Russia's finance ministry on Friday said the government had spent $4.8 billion from the National Wealth Fund (NWF) in November on financing the budget deficit, as Russia diverts more money to its military campaign in Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nThe ministry had said in October it was drawing down about $16 billion from the NWF, Russia's rainy day fund, with a view to spending it to help cover the budget deficit forecast to reach around 2% of GDP this year and next.\n\nThe NWF stood at $186.5 billion as of December 1, equivalent to 8.5% of Russia's projected gross domestic product for this year.\n\n7:35 p.m.:\n\n6:40 p.m.: Russia is expanding and modernizing its nuclear arsenal, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Friday at a time when Russian President Vladimir Putin, faced with setbacks in Ukraine, has repeatedly suggested he could use nuclear weapons, Reuters reported.\n\nAustin's comments are in line with a recent Pentagon policy document on nuclear arms.\n\nRussia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, with close to 6,000 warheads, according to experts.

Russia did not immediately comment on the allegations.\n\nKyiv has accused Russia of putting pressure on Ukrainian employees at the plant to sign contracts with Russia's nuclear energy company. In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree transferring the plant and all Ukrainian employees from Energoatom to a subsidiary of Russia's state nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom.

He said it was a technical meeting and should not be seen as a sign the two sides were ready to resume discussing \"major issues\".\n\nBoth the Russian embassy in Washington and the U.S. embassy in Moscow have been cut back significantly in recent years in a series of tit-for-tat expulsions that have seen dozens of Russian and U.S. diplomats sent back to their home countries.\n\n8:55 a.m.: When Ukrainians returned to the village of Snihurivka after it was liberated from Russian forces, they found some unpleasant surprises in their homes. Current Time, a co-production of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and VOA, has this report.\n\n8:40 a.m.: The U.S. is sending an additional $275 million in military aid to Ukraine, including large amounts of ammunition and high-tech systems that can be used to detect and counter drones in its ongoing war with Russia, The Associated Press reported Friday, quoting U.S. officials.\n\nThe total aid amount is smaller than most of the recent packages the U.S. has delivered, and it comes as many military officials and experts predict a reduction in attacks during the winter. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia appears to be slowing its military activities to regroup and launch a new offensive when the weather warms.\n\nThe officials said the latest package of aid includes 80,000 rounds of ammunition for howitzers and an undisclosed amount of ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS.

He said Russian mines are a legacy of terror that Ukraine will have to contend with for years.\n\nThe Ukrainian Interior Ministry said last month that approximately one-third of the territory of Ukraine remains potentially dangerous due to explosive objects.\n\nAt the end of October, Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskiy said that, in the territories recently liberated from the Russian Army, mining is twice as dense as in the previously de-occupied part of the Kyiv region or Chernihiv region.\n\n7:55 a.m.:\n\n7:40 a.m.: Ahead of elections next year in Poland, Jaroslaw Kaczynski and the nationalist conservative ruling party that he leads have been lashing out against Germany while seeking to cast their main competitor as loyal to Berlin, The Associated Press reported.\n\nPolands ruling party leader claims Germany seeks to dominate Europe. He warns that Poles could end up under the \"German heel.\" He snubs a German offer of anti-missile systems before Poland eventually accepts them but gets in an anti-German dig along the way.\n\nMany Poles, like others in central Europe, have been critical of Germanys stance toward Russia in the years leading up to Russias February 24 invasion of Ukraine, particularly for gas deals that created dependence on Russian energy and helped Russia build up its war chest.\n\nBut critics of the ruling party, Law and Justice, say its anti-German rhetoric is becoming a threat to Polands national interests and risks creating a crack between Western allies while Russia wages war in Ukraine.\n\n7:20 a.m.:\n\n7:05 a.m.: The number of oil tankers waiting in the Black Sea to pass through Istanbul's Bosphorus Strait on the way to the Mediterranean rose to 20 on Friday, Tribeca shipping agency said, as Turkey held talks to resolve an insurance dispute behind the build-up, Reuters reported.\n\nDismissing pressure from abroad over the lengthening queue, Turkey's maritime authority said on Thursday it would continue to block oil tankers that lacked the appropriate insurance letters, and it needed time for checks.\n\n6:55 a.m.:\n\n6:40 a.m.: Russian forces pounded the entire front line in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk and Luhansk, the General Staff of the Ukrainian military said on Friday, as U.S. officials said that Washington was preparing to send Ukraine a $275 million military aid package containing new capabilities to defeat drones and strengthen air defenses, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nUkrainian forces repelled dozens of Russian attacks in the Bilohoryivka area in Luhansk as well as Klishchyivka and Maryinka in the Donetsk region, the General Staff said in its daily update.\n\nThe fiercest fighting continued near the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiyivka in Donetsk, regional Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a television interview. Artillery slammed into the town of Toretsk southwest of Bakhmut, killing one civilian and damaging 12 buildings, Kyrylenko said.\n\n\"The entire front line is being shelled,\" he said, adding that Russians were also trying to advance near Lyman, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces last month in one of a number of setbacks suffered by Moscow since invading its neighbor in February.\n\nIn Bakhmut and other parts of the Donetsk region, Ukrainian forces countered with barrages from rocket launchers, witnesses said.\n\n6:25 a.m.:\n\n6:10 a.m.: WNBA star Brittney Griners 10-month imprisonment in Russia on drug charges came to an end on Thursday, spreading relief and joy across the sports world and beyond, The Associated Press reported.\n\nIts unknown if and when she might return to a basketball court.

We need to know what is happening exactly,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\nHis biggest immediate worry is that fighting this winter will interrupt the natural migration period of dolphins across the Black Sea.\n\n\"There should be an ecological corridor starting from the Danube River to the Odessa area, where there's a highly concentrated dolphins population,\" he said of a region near Ukraine's southwestern border with Romania.\n\n12:02 a.m.: South Africa's leading opposition party on Thursday called on the government to explain why a Russian cargo ship that it said was under western sanctions had docked at a Cape Town naval base, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThe vessel arrived at Simon's Town, South Africa's largest naval base, on Tuesday, the Democratic Alliance (DA) party said, adding it seemed to have turned off its automatic identification system, which provides the ship's position and other information.\n\nAt night, cranes had been offloading cargo from it and onto trucks protected by armed personnel, it added.\n\nSouth Africa has resisted taking sides following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a war that has triggered sweeping Western sanctions.\n\nThe South Africa defense ministry and the navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe ship, identified by local media as the Lady R, flies a Russian flag and is en route from Cameroon to Tanzania, according to vessel tracking websites.\n\nSome information in this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

Military equipment is stationed in residential areas,\" Federov said in November.\n\nThe Melitopol mayor Ivan Fedorov said there had been several explosions, including at the Melitopol Christian Church, \"which the occupiers seized several months ago and turned into their hideout.\"\n\nFedorov, who is not in Melitopol, said there were dead and wounded among the Russian forces there.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian officials said Sunday morning that Ukrainian missiles had hit several apartment buildings in the Donetsk Peoples Republic and that some landed near the Opera and Ballet Theater and the Kalinin Hospital.\n\nAlexei Kulemzin, head of the Russian-backed city administration, said Ukraine launched 20 Grad missiles around 5:54 a.m. local time Sunday in the direction of the Voroshilovsky and Kalininsky districts.\n\nKulemzin said Ukraine also shelled the citys Kyivskiy district late Saturday night around 11:03 p.m. local time.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has not yet confirmed or commented on the attack.\n\nDonetsk has been held by Russian-backed separatists since 2014.\n\nUkraines southern Dnipropetrovsk region was also shelled overnight with Grad and heavy artillery, Valentyn Reznichenko, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, said on Telegram Sunday.

Three villages were left without electricity and water, he said, adding that emergency crews have already started repair work.\n\nExplosions in Crimea\n\nThe attack on Melitopol came amid social media footage and reports of several blasts in the Crimean city of Simferopol at around 9 p.m. local time on Saturday.\n\nThere were also reports of explosions in Sevastopol, the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea fleet; at a Russian military barracks in Sovietske; and in Hvardiiske, Dzhankoi and Nyzhniohirskyi\n\nThe blasts come after Moscow ramped up its missile attacks on Ukraine last week, following Russian claims that Kyiv was behind recent drone hits on military airfields deep inside its territory.\n\nThere are conflicting accounts surrounding the explosions in Crimea.\n\nThe unofficial Crimean media portal \"Krymskyi veter\" said an explosion at a Russian military barracks in Sovietske had set the barracks on fire and there were dead and wounded.\n\nHowever, a pro-Russian Crimean channel claimed that the fire at the barracks had been caused by \"careless handling of fire.\"\n\n\"Two people died. Now all the servicemen, about two hundred people, are accommodated in another premises,\" it said.\n\nSergey Aksenov, the Russian-appointed head of Crimea, said on Telegram: \"The air defense system worked over Simferopol. All services are working as usual.\n\nMikhail Razvozhaev, governor of Sevastopol, said the explosions were due to firing exercises.\n\n1.5 million in Odesa without power\n\nThe news comes amid reports that 1.5 million people in the Odesa region of Ukraine have been left without power following strikes by Iranian-made drones.\n\n\"In total, Russian terrorists used 15 Shahed drones against Odesa,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during his daily address on Saturday.\n\nHe said \"Ukrainian sky defenders\" had shot down 10 of the 15 drones, but the damage was still \"critical\" and he suggested it will take a few days to restore electricity supply in the region.\n\n\"Only critical infrastructure is connected and to the extent where it is possible to supply electricity,\" he said.\n\nUkraine has been facing a wide assault on its critical infrastructure and power sources since early October. This has left millions across the country facing power cuts amid freezing winter temperatures.\n\n\"In general, both emergency and stabilization power outages continue in various regions,\" Zelensky said. \"The power system is now, to put it mildly, very far from a normal state.\"\n\nOdesa was already among the worst affected regions following Russias previous attacks on critical infrastructure.\n\n\"This is the true attitude of Russia towards Odesa, towards Odesa residents deliberate bullying, deliberate attempt to bring disaster to the city,\" Zelensky added.\n\nUkraine on Saturday received \"a new support package from Norway in the amount of $100 million\" that will be used \"precisely for the restoration of our energy system after these Russian strikes,\" Zelensky added.",

                "cc_text": "KYIV, Ukraine -- The head of NATO expressed worry that the fighting in Ukraine could spin out of control and become a war between Russia and NATO, according to an interview released Friday.\n\n\"If things go wrong, they can go horribly wrong,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in remarks to Norwegian broadcaster NRK.\n\n\"It is a terrible war in Ukraine. It is also a war that can become a full-fledged war that spreads into a major war between NATO and Russia,\" he said. \"We are working on that every day to avoid that.\"\n\nStoltenberg, a former prime minister of Norway, said in the interview \"there is no doubt that a full-fledged war is a possibility,\" adding that it was important to avoid a conflict \"that involves more countries in Europe and becomes a full-fledged war in Europe.\"\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly accused NATO allies of effectively becoming a party to the conflict by providing Ukraine with weapons, training its troops and feeding military intelligence to attack Russian forces.\n\nIn comments that reflected soaring tensions between Russia and the West, President Vladimir Putin suggested Friday that Moscow might think about using what he described as the U.S. concept of a preemptive strike.\n\n\"Speaking about a disarming strike, maybe it's worth thinking about adopting the ideas developed by our U.S. counterparts, their ideas of ensuring their security,\" he said.\n\nLong before the Ukraine war, the Kremlin expressed concern about U.S. efforts to develop the so-called Prompt Global Strike capability that envisions hitting an adversary's strategic targets with precision-guided conventional weapons anywhere in the world within one hour.\n\nPutin noted that such a strike could knock out command facilities.\n\n\"We are just thinking about it, they weren't shy to openly talk about it during the past years,\" he said, claiming that Moscow's precision-guided cruise missiles outperform similar U.S. weapons and Russia has hypersonic weapons that the U.S. hasn't deployed.\n\nPutin also said he was disappointed with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's recent comments that a 2015 peace deal for eastern Ukraine negotiated by France and Germany had bought time for Ukraine to prepare for the 2022 war.\n\n\"I assumed that other participants of the process were sincere with us, but it turned out that they were cheating us,\" he said. \"It turned out that they wanted to pump Ukraine with weapons and prepare for hostilities.\"\n\nPutin argued that Merkel's statement showed that Russia was right in launching what he calls the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. \"Perhaps we should have started it earlier,\" he said.\n\nHe also said her comments further eroded Russia's trust in the West, complicating any possible peace talks.\n\n\"Eventually we will have to negotiate an agreement,\" he said. \"But after such statements there is an issue of trust. Trust is close to zero. I repeatedly have said that we are ready for an agreement, but it makes us think, think about whom we are dealing with.\"\n\nIn separate comments via video link to defense and security chiefs of several ex-Soviet nations, Putin again accused the West of using Ukraine as a tool against his country.\n\n\"For many years, the West shamelessly exploited and pumped out its resources, encouraged genocide and terror in the Donbas and effectively turned the country into a colony,\" he said. \"Now it's cynically using the Ukrainian people as cannon fodder, as a ram against Russia by continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons and ammunition, sending mercenaries and pushing it to a suicidal track.\"\n\nUkrainians say they are fighting for freedom against an unwanted invader and aggressor.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by phone Friday and both \"agreed on the importance of preempting Russia's insincere calls for a cease-fire,\" Sunak's office said. The prime minister added that the Kremlin needed to withdraw its forces before any agreement could be considered.\n\nDEATH TOLL GROWS\n\nHeavy fighting continued Friday in eastern and southern Ukraine, mostly in regions that Russia illegally annexed in September.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said five civilians have been killed and another 13 have been wounded by Russian shelling in the last 24 hours.\n\nDonetsk regional Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said the Russians were pressing an offensive on Bakhmut with daily attacks, despite taking heavy casualties.\n\n\"You can best describe those attacks as cannon fodder,\" Kyrylenko said in televised remarks. \"They are mostly relying on infantry and less on armor, and they can't advance.\"\n\nIn neighboring Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai said the Ukrainian military was pushing its counteroffensive toward Kreminna and Svatove.\n\nHe voiced hope Ukraine can reclaim control of Kreminna by year's end, and then by the end of winter reclaim areas in the region that were captured by Russia since the war began.\n\nIn the south, Kherson regional Gov. Yaroslav Yanyshevych said eight civilians were wounded by Russian shelling over the past 24 hours, and in the city of Kherson that Ukraine retook last month, a children's hospital and a morgue were damaged.\n\nIn the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, Russian forces shelled Nikopol and Chervonohryhorivka, which are across the Dnieper River from the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.\n\nZaporizhzhia Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko said Russian shelling damaged residential buildings and power lines.\n\nIn the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said three civilians were wounded by Russian shelling, with one later dying.\n\nWAR OPPONENT SENTENCED\n\nIn Moscow, a Russian court Friday sentenced an opposition politician, Ilya Yashin, to 8 years in prison after finding him guilty on charges of \"spreading false information\" about atrocities committed in the Ukrainian city of Bucha by Russian troops in February and March.\n\nJudge Oksana Goryunova also ordered that Yashin be barred from using the internet for four years. Prosecutors had requested a sentence of nine years.\n\nYashin, who pleaded innocent, is among the highest-profile opposition politicians remaining in Russia.\n\nBefore his arrest in July, he spoke about the war on his YouTube channel, often voicing criticism of Putin and his \"special military operation.\" While many Putin critics have fled Russia, especially immediately after its invasion of Ukraine, Yashin vowed to remain, even if it meant serving prison time.\n\nProsecutor Sergei Belov told the Meshchansky District Court in Moscow that Yashin had spoken \"indiscriminately\" about the coverage of the war by the Russian news media, and instead cited news produced by outlets from \"unfriendly states: the United States and its satellites\" that \"supply instructors and weapons to Ukraine.\"\n\nAfter the announcement, Yashin posted a statement on Telegram.\n\n\"So, the court sentenced me to 8 years and 6 months in prison,\" he wrote. \"Well, the authors of the verdict are optimistic about Putin's prospects. In my opinion, way too optimistic.\"\n\nYashin compared the process to a Soviet show trial and said the prosecutor was trying to imitate his predecessors from the Stalinist period, when millions of people were sent to labor camps or shot as enemies of the state.\n\n\"With this hysterical verdict, the government wants to intimidate us all, but in fact it only shows its weakness,\" he wrote. \"Strong leaders are calm and self-confident, and only weaklings seek to shut everyone up, burn out any dissent. So today it only remains for me to repeat what was said on the day of my arrest: I am not afraid, and you are not afraid.\"\n\nAt least 19,335 people have been detained at anti-war protests since Feb. 24, according to OVD-Info, a Russian human-rights watchdog that monitors police activity.\n\nDespite the heightened climate of repression, Yashin said he believed he would not have to serve his whole sentence.\n\n\"Changes are not far off, and soon we will have a lot of work to restore justice and humanism in our country,\" he wrote.\n\nMORE U.S. AID\n\nThe U.S. is sending an additional $275 million in military aid to Ukraine, including large amounts of ammunition and high-tech systems that can be used to detect and counter drones in its ongoing war with Russia, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe total aid amount is smaller than most of the recent packages the U.S. has delivered, and it comes as many military officials and experts predict a reduction in attacks during the winter.\n\nThe officials said the latest package of aid includes 80,000 rounds of ammunition for howitzers and an undisclosed amount of ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS. It also includes systems to counter drones and air defenses, along with more humvees, generators and other combat equipment.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the aid package prior to its public release, which was expected Friday.\n\nDrone attacks by both sides have been increasing, making detection of the unmanned explosives critical for Ukrainian forces. Russia bought hundreds of attack drones from Iran over the summer, and officials said this week that Moscow is looking to do more of the same.\n\nRussian forces have increasingly targeted Ukraine's civilian infrastructure including power plants, leaving thousands without heat and electricity as the winter months set in.\n\nIncluding the latest aid, the U.S. has now committed more than $19.3 billion in weapons and other equipment to Ukraine since Russia attacked on Feb. 24. The aid will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, which allows the Pentagon to take weapons from its own stocks and quickly ship them to Ukraine.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Jamey Keaten, Jan M.

The enemy still possesses substantial resources,\" Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said. He added, however, that \"signs are accumulating that [Russia] needs a pause at all costs.\"\n\nKherson in crosshairs\n\nUkraine has faced a blistering onslaught of Russian artillery fire and drone attacks since early October. The shelling has been especially intense in Kherson since Russian forces withdrew and Ukraine's army reclaimed the southern city almost three weeks ago.\n\nA volunteer puts wood on a fire to cook hot meals for residents in Kherson's city centre on Thursday. (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)\n\nUkraine's presidential office said Thursday that at least two civilians were killed and six others wounded nationwide by the latest Russian shelling. In Kherson, a 70-year-old woman was killed in her apartment and a 64-year-old man was wounded on the street. A 15-year-old boy died when a hospital in Bilopillia was hit, the presidential office said.\n\nLocal authorities said about two-thirds of Kherson had electricity as of Thursday night. Some residents congregated at the train station or at government-supported tents that provided heating, food, drinks and electricity to charge cellphones.\n\nWalking gingerly toward an evacuation train, 79-year-old Liudmyla Biloshysta said she decided to leave and join her children in Kyiv because she feared conditions in Kherson would worsen.\n\nAn electricity worker undertakes repairs on a destroyed high-voltage power line in Kherson, Ukraine, on Thursday.

Russian forces continued their attempts to encircle the city, , focusing on several villages around it and trying to cut a key highway. (Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\n\"Eight shelling attacks per night. The Russians from evening till morning struck the Nikopol area with [multiple rocket launchers] and heavy artillery. Two districts Marhanets and Chervonohryhorivka came under enemy fire,\" governor Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian forces continued their attempts to encircle the Donetsk region city of Bakhmut, focusing on several villages around it and trying to cut a key highway.\n\nAndriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine's presidential office, said Russia released 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war and Ukraine turned over the same number Thursday as the fighting continued.\n\nIn Berlin, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg praised the \"heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people\" against Russia's attacks, saying Ukraine has made significant battlefield gains with the help of allies.\n\n\"But we should not underestimate Russia,\" Stoltenberg warned in a speech at the Berlin Security Conference.\n\n\"Russian missiles and drones continue to rain down on Ukrainian cities, civilians and critical infrastructure, causing enormous human suffering as winter sets in.\"\n\nRussia's foreign minister accused the West on Thursday of becoming directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine by supplying the country with weapons and training its soldiers.\n\nForeign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said that Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities and other key infrastructure were intended to weaken Ukraine's military potential and derail the shipments of Western weapons.\n\nRussia underestimated Ukraine, allies: NATO\n\nStoltenberg, the NATO chief, said Russian President Vladimir Putin had made \"two big strategic mistakes\" when he invaded Ukraine in February: underestimating Ukraine and underestimating the support NATO and its allies were willing to provide so the country could defend itself.\n\nIn a related development, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday strongly condemned a European Union proposal, issued the previous day, to set up a UN-backed court to investigate possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a video message Wednesday that the EU would work with international partners to get \"the broadest international support possible\" for the proposed war crimes court while continuing to support the International Criminal Court.\n\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine are among the ICC's 123 member states.",

                "more_detailed": "In recent strikes on Melitopol, Ukrainian forces employed the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) to conduct attacks on key targets within the city. The precision strikes reportedly hit a restaurant-hotel complex on the outskirts of Melitopol known as \"Prival Okhotnika,\" or Hunter's Rest, a checkpoint near the city, and a military unit that was described as \"completely destroyed\" near the village of Semenivka (3,4,6). The effectiveness of the HIMARS system, supplied by the United States, has been evident in the substantial damage and casualties caused by these strikes, showcasing the system's capability to target locations away from the frontlines, including command posts and other strategic targets (5,7,8).\n\nThe successful employment of HIMARS by Ukrainian forces indicates a significant enhancement of Ukraine's military capabilities, allowing for precise long-range strikes that have the potential to disrupt Russian military operations. This was demonstrated by the damage to Russian barracks and a key bridge outside of Melitopol, which are critical objectives for Kyiv in the region (6,7). The use of HIMARS, along with the repeated downing of Russian missiles and drones by Ukrainian air defense systems, underscores Ukraine's growing capacity to counter Russian military aggression effectively. These developments in Ukraine's defense capabilities underscore the importance of continued international support, as evidenced by the substantial aid pledged at the Paris conference to assist Ukraine through the winter months (9)."

                "summary": "The Ukrainian forces' strategic targeting in Melitopol, including a church repurposed as a Russian base and potential Wagner Group barracks, indicates a high level of intelligence capability, enabling them to identify and strike military assets nested within civilian areas (1,2,3). The choice of targets, such as command posts and a bridge, reflects Ukraine's priority to disrupt Russian logistics and command structures, crucial for regaining control in the south and possibly preparing for an advance toward Crimea (3,5). The employment of HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, capable of precision strikes, underscores Ukraine's emphasis on long-range weaponry to increase pressure on Russian forces and reclaim territory (2,5). This strategic focus, coupled with the assistance from the United States in strengthening air defenses, suggests an integrated approach to weakening Russian military footholds and restoring Ukrainian sovereignty (4,5).",

This precision in targeting suggests that Ukrainian intelligence has effectively gathered detailed information on Russian military occupation and deployments within the city. The ability to strike specific targets, such as the bridge and a site being used by the Wagner Group, indicates a focused effort to disrupt Russian supply lines and command structures, which are essential for maintaining their defensive positions in the region (3,8).\n\nStrategically, Ukraine's choice of targets in Melitopol underlines its priorities to reclaim territory in the south and to potentially pave the way for an eventual counteroffensive towards Crimea (2,6). The attacks on Melitopol are meant to weaken Russian defenses and morale, as indicated by an adviser to President Zelensky, who suggested that the fall of Melitopol could lead to the collapse of the Russian defense line all the way to Kherson, and further provide a direct route to Crimea (6). Furthermore, the use of HIMARS systems, which have been critical in striking high-value targets, underscores Ukraine's strategic use of advanced weaponry provided by allies to exert pressure on Russian forces and reclaim key territories (5)."

Additionally, the Russian-installed governor's acknowledgment of the strike, without providing details on the military nature of the target, could contribute to the perception of indiscriminate attacks and war crimes in the conflict (4).",
                "summary": "The destruction of civilian infrastructure, such as the 'recreation center' in Melitopol, illustrates a pattern of attacks that has led international bodies to consider them war crimes, reflecting a deliberate campaign against Ukrainian civilian morale and habitability, rather than incidental collateral damage (1). These actions by Russian forces, which have resulted in fatalities and injuries, not only breach International humanitarian law (IHL) but also violate international human rights law, including the right to culture (1). The attack on the 'recreation center' in Melitopol, confirmed by both the Moscow-installed governor and former Ukrainian administrator, has caused casualties among civilians and military personnel alike, further exacerbating the perception of indiscriminate violence (3,4). Moreover, the involvement of Russian paramilitary groups in Ukraine and their solicitation of intelligence on NATO countries may escalate concerns about the conflict spreading beyond Ukraine's borders (5).",
                "more_detailed": "The destruction of a 'recreation center' in Melitopol, where civilians and military personnel were reportedly dining, has been acknowledged by both Russian-appointed officials and Ukrainian sources, highlighting the ongoing devastation of civilian infrastructure in the conflict (3,4,7). The incident, which resulted in casualties and was part of a series of attacks attributed to Ukrainian forces, may exacerbate the already critical view held by international observers regarding the conduct of hostilities in the region. Such actions contribute to perceptions of a disregard for the safety and well-being of civilians and potentially contravene International humanitarian law, which seeks to limit the impact of armed conflict on non-combatants (1).\n\nFurthermore, the targeting of facilities with dual civilian and military use, such as the 'recreation center' and a hotel allegedly housing Russian FSB analysts, raises complex questions about the legitimacy of military objectives versus the protection of civilians (6,8). Reports of these incidents are likely to feed into the broader narrative of a conflict marked by indiscriminate and deliberate attacks on civilian areas, which not only influence international perceptions but may also impact the level of support and aid provided to Ukraine, as evidenced by the significant funding raised in support of the country at the aid conference in Paris (5,10). Such perceptions could drive international diplomatic efforts and sanctions, shaping the global response to the conflict and the parties involved (1,2)."

                "summary": "Casualty figures provided by Ukrainian and Russian sources regarding the attacks in Melitopol are conflicting and cannot be independently verified, with Russian sources reporting two deaths and 10 injuries, and Ukrainian sources claiming hundreds of Russian soldiers were killed or wounded (1,2,3). The exiled Ukrainian mayor, Ivan Fedorov, alleges that the injured were taken to hospitals in occupied Crimea due to insufficient capacity in Melitopol, suggesting higher casualties than Russian sources report, though these claims also remain unconfirmed (4). Reuters and other independent entities have not been able to substantiate the reports of attacks or deaths, indicating a significant challenge in verifying the actual numbers (1,3). Additionally, the Ukrainian military has not provided specific details on the casualties, further complicating efforts to determine the reliability of the figures (4).",
                "more_detailed": "The casualty figures provided by Ukrainian and Russian sources regarding the conflict in Ukraine are difficult to verify and are often conflicting (1,2,3,4). For instance, in Melitopol, the Russian-installed authorities reported two deaths and ten injuries from a missile attack, while the exiled Ukrainian mayor claimed that scores of \"invaders\" were killed (1,3). Similarly, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, gave high casualty numbers for Russian forces without providing evidence, while the Ukrainian military has not provided specific figures but described the targets hit (4,8). Reuters and other independent organizations have not been able to independently confirm these reports (1,3,6,7,10).\n\nThe challenge in verifying casualty figures is exacerbated by the propaganda and information warfare that accompanies the conflict. For example, Ukrainian military intelligence provided figures for the use of Iranian-made drones by Russia, which correspond with Western estimates, but could not be independently verified (7). In the Donetsk region, both Ukrainian and Russian-installed officials provided reports of fatalities that also could not be independently confirmed (6). Russian and Ukrainian officials have provided their own estimates of daily military casualties during the fighting in Bakhmut and Soledar, yet these figures too remain unverified (9,10). This lack of independent verification underscores the complexity of obtaining accurate information in wartime conditions, where the fog of war and strategic interests can skew the reported numbers (1,2,3,4,6,7,9,10)."

                "cc_text": "The Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in southern Ukraine saw heavy shelling at the weekend, according to both Russian and Ukrainian sources, but there are conflicting reports on the number of casualties. Following an \"evening of strikes on Russo-fascist bases, 200 occupiers were roasted [killed]\" and 300 more wounded, wrote Ivan Federov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, on Telegram on Saturday. Fedorov later rowed back on these claims, instead saying there were \"dozens\" dead. Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed governor of Zaporizhzhia region, where Meliopol is located, confirmed there had been explosions in the city in a Telegram post. Balitsky posted a video showing emergency services attending a huge fire on Saturday night. Balitsky described the target of the attack as a \"recreation center\" where civilians and military personnel were \"having dinner on Saturday night,\" but he did not name the target. According to Balitsky, there were two dead and 10 injured in the attack. \"Three of them need to be hospitalized, and now they are being treated as inpatients in a medical facility,\" he said. On Sunday night, Fedorov told Ukrainian television that \"yesterday the enemy had a disappointing day and a disappointing night in the temporarily occupied Melitopol district.\" He listed three sites that were struck, including a \"restaurant-hotel complex on the outskirts of Melitopol Prival Okhotnika' [Hunter's Rest'].\" The other two were a checkpoint 20km (12 miles) from Melitopol in Novobohdanivka, and a military unit that was \"completely destroyed\" near the village of Semenivka. Melitopol lies south of the city of Zaporizhzhia and to the east of Kherson. It is a major Russian logistics hub and has been in Russian hands since the early days of the invasion. Some background: Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, underlined the importance of the city in comments made to local media outlet Feigin Live on Saturday. \"If Melitopol falls, the entire defense (of the occupiers) to Kherson collapses, the Ukrainian armed forces jump right to the border with Crimea on the isthmus,\" said Arestovych. The attacks on Melitopol came as Ukrainian forces also struck a hotel in Luhansk which allegedly housed a Wagner mercenary unit.",

The attacks struck a number of different locations, including a church being used as a base by Russian forces, according to the city's exiled mayor, Ivan Fedorov, who shared a video filmed at night of a fire burning in the distance. In an interview with Ukrainian television a day later, Federov rowed back on that number, saying that \"dozens\" were dead.

Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed governor of Zaporizhzhia region, where Melitopol is located, said that Ukraine had hit Melitopol using a HIMARS system, killing two people and wounding 10 others, three of whom were treated in the hospital a significantly lower number than was reported by Fedorov. Russians \"redeploying\": Fedorov claimed in an interview on Monday that Russian troops in the city were \"panicking\" and \"redeploying,\" given Ukrainian strikes on the city.

(Photo by Leon Klein/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nBut those stocks are \"rapidly dwindling, probably forcing them to increasingly use ammunition in what we would consider degraded conditions,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"So this essentially puts Russian forces in a position to have to make a choice about what risks it's willing to accept in terms of increased failure rates, unpredictable performance, and whether or not these degraded munitions would require any type of refurbishment, which of course requires a certain amount of expertise at times.\"\n\nRussian reliance on older ammunition has resulted in a lot of duds, or worse, said the official.\n\n\"You load the ammunition and you cross your fingers and hope it's going to fire,\" the official said. \"Or wherever it lands that it's going to explode.\"\n\nRussia is running out of new munitions the Pentagon said on Monday. (Photo by Leon Klein/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nRussia has \"drawn from its aging ammunition stockpile, which does indicate that they are willing to use that older ammunition some of which was originally produced more than 40 years ago,\" the official said.\n\nAs a result, \"the Russian military will very likely struggle to replenish its reserve of fully serviceable artillery and rocket ammunition through foreign suppliers, increased domestic production and refurbishment.\"\n\nThats why Russia is turning to Iran and North Korea \"to try to obtain some more dependable ammunition,\" the official said.\n\nBut Russia may no longer be able to count on Iran to provide short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), a shift which Ukrainian intelligence officials said had been anticipated to take place last month.\n\nIran, fearing an international backlash, \"wants to limit the range of the missiles it plans to provide Russia for the war in Ukraine, four senior Israeli officials told Axios, citing intelligence reports.\"\n\nThe U.S. position is that such transfers of arms from Iran to Russia violate UN Security Council resolution 2231, which among other things calls for any Iranian nuclear, ballistic missile or arms transfers to be approved by the U.N.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the international fallout and not violate that resolution, \"Iran plans to give Russia only missiles with a range of less than 300 kilometers and modify other missiles so they stay within the parameters of the resolution, the Israeli officials said,\" according to Axios.\n\nThis includes the Fateh-110 missile system, which has a range of 300 kilometers, but, according to the report, \"the Iranians plan to modify it so that it doesn't violate the resolution, according to the Israeli officials.\"\n\nIran will limit its sale of short-range ballistic missiles to Russia only to those with a range of 300 kilometers, like the Fateh-110, Axios reported. (Photo by Mohsen Shandiz/Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nThe Iranians had also considered sending Russia the Zolfaghar missile, with a range of about 435 miles, but are no longer planning to, according to Axios.\n\nYou can read more about Irans SRBMs and its previous plans to ship them to Russia in our coverage here. We will have to wait and see if these reports of an altered export strategy for the missiles prove accurate.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, British Defense Minister Ben Wallace said his nation was not ruling out sending longer-range munitions to Ukraine than the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) for the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS and M270 multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) provided by the U.S. and allies.\n\nSo far, those launchers, which have had a major impact on the battlefield already, fire M30A1 and M31A1 227mm precision-guided rockets, which have advanced fragmentation and unity high-explosive warheads respectively. Both types have a stated maximum range of at least approximately 43.5 miles (70 kilometers).\n\nTo date, the U.S. has declined to provide Ukraine with any variant of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missile that would greatly extend the range the country could hold Russian targets at risk of missile attacks. It can also destroy larger, more heavily fortified targets across its up to nearly 200-mile range.\n\nBut Monday, Wallace said if Russia continues to attack Ukraine's civilian infrastructure, he will keep an \"open mind\" on the systems Britain will provide Ukraine.\n\nSuch attacks, he said, are \"against all the rules of law, including the Geneva Conventions\" and constitute \"war crime[s].\" He stated that the attacks should \"not go unpunished. I constantly review the weapon systems we could provide.\"\n\n\"We too have in our armory potential weapon systems that are longer [range], and should the Russians continue to target civilian areas and try and break those Geneva conventions then I will be open-minded to seeing what we do next.\"\n\nWhat exactly he is referring to isn't clear. Storm Shadow cruise missiles, a highly advanced air-launched weapon, and submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles are the only types in inventory that immediately come to mind. Tomahawk is a non-starter and Storm Shadow would be a major escalation in capabilities if offered to Ukraine in some form.\n\nBefore going into the latest news from Ukraine, The War Zone readers can get caught up on our previous rolling coverage here.\n\nThe Latest\n\nOn the battlefield, theres \"particularly intense fighting nearby in the Donbas region, where Russian forces are conducting offensive ground operations in an attempt to take the city\" of Bakhmut, a senior U.S. defense official said. Fighting remains heavy and the Russians have made some incremental gains in taking territory, however, Ukraine continues to hold Bakhmut, which has been devastated by the fighting.\n\n\"For a while now, Russia has been pouring in troops and equipment into that region, it had been very focused on it for a while,\" the official said. \"That was happening concurrently with the Ukrainian counter-offensive happening in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. So the fact that there's intense fighting there is not necessarily new, but for whatever reason, we continue to see Russia prioritize this particular area. And as I've mentioned, they've taken some incremental amount of territory - not a lot. But for obvious reasons, Ukraine continues to hold the line and defend its city that's under attack here.\"\n\nThe assault on Bakhmut has come at a high cost and fits in with the way \"that Russia has prosecuted this campaign,\" the official said. \"Their way of combat is through heavy artillery strikes and throwing forces at the problem. I don't have numbers to provide, but we've certainly seen the reports of significant casualties.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, in the Kharkiv, and Kherson regions, the Ukrainians continue to consolidate their previous gains while Russian forces bolster their defensive lines,\" the official said.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War assessment.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) denied rumors on Dec. 11 that Gen. Valery Gerasimov resigned or was removed from his position as Chief of the General Staff.\n\nUkrainian and Russian sources reported that fighting continues along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the Luhansk Oblast and near Lyman in the Donetsk Oblast amidst poor weather conditions.\n\nA Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces transferred over 200 pieces of equipment from the Kherson direction to the Kupyansk direction, and geolocated footage shows Russian T-90 tanks in Luhansk Oblast headed west. A Ukrainian official stated that a larger Russian force grouping does not currently pose a threat.\n\nRussian forces made marginal territorial gains around Bakhmut as Russian and Ukrainian sources reported continued fighting in the area. A Ukrainian Armed Forces Eastern Group spokesperson stated that Russian forces changed tactics from using battalion tactical groups (BTGs) to smaller assault groups for offensive actions.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces struck Skadovsk, Hola Prystan, Oleshky, and Nova Kakhovka, Kherson Oblast, all along major Russian logistics lines.\n\nUkrainian officials reported that Russian occupation authorities intensified forced mobilization measures in occupied Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces also continue to dig in on the Crimean peninsula they've occupied since 2014. Up until recently a tourist hot-spot, Crimea's waterfront has recently seen the construction of trenches being built by Russian forces. Ukrainian officials have made no secret about their intentions to recapture Crimea, which has seen a spate of drone and sabotage attacks as of late. Clearly, Russia is preparing for potential raids from the sea.\n\nEven Russian propagandist and war criminal Igor Girkin is expressing doubt that Russian fortifications can hold back a Ukrainian advance.\n\nOne potential eventual route of attack on Crimea will be from the east, through the Zaporizhzhia Oblast, which may be the next target of a Ukrainian counterattack. Perhaps to that end, the Russian-occupied town of Melitopol in that oblast has come under attack and the first images of a destroyed bridge there emerged on social media.\n\nMelitopol was also the scene of an apparent Ukrainian HIMARS attack on a Wagner Group barracks in a hotel that resulted in a varying number of deaths. Russian officials claimed just two while a former Ukrainian mayor claimed \"scores,\" according to the BBC.\n\nHIMARS remains a feared weapon of choice by Ukraine.\n\nTanks are still playing a major role on the battlefield, too. The Ukraine Weapons Tracker OSINT group shared a rare video of a tank-on-tank battle in the Luhansk Oblast, in which a Ukrainian T-64BV tank obliterated a Russian T-72B tank with just one shot.\n\nAnd Ukraine continues to land precision drone hits on Russian forces.\n\nThe Russians too are causing destruction, including military hardware donated to Ukraine.\n\nThree British-supplied Mastiff armored vehicles were seen damaged or destroyed in recent fighting.\n\nEquipment continues to be captured on both sides, like this Finnish Sisu XA-185 armored personnel carrier that was donated to Ukraine.\n\nRussia apparently continues to struggle to supply its mobilized reservists with even the most basic of supplies.\n\nAnd when Russian troops do get supplies, it's apparently not always what is really needed.\n\nAnd finally, when the war is eventually over, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he hopes to visit the seacoast and have a beer.\n\nAt least that's what the former comedian told another famous comedian.\n\nYou can hear all that and more on the latest episode of David Letterman's My Next Guest Needs No Introduction. His interview with Zelensky, which took place in October 300 feet underground on a Kyiv subway platform, aired Monday.\n\nThat's it for now.\n\nWe will update this story if there is anything major to add until our next new update is posted.",

                "cc_text": "KYIV, Ukraine -\n\nUkrainian drones struck two air bases deep inside Russian territory, the Kremlin said Monday, shortly before Russian forces unleashed a massive missile barrage in Ukraine that struck homes and buildings and killed civilians.\n\nThe unprecedented attack in Russia threatened a major escalation of the nine-month war because it hit an airfield housing bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons. President Vladimir Putin has threatened to use all available means to defend his land, a remark many have interpreted to include nuclear weapons.\n\nRussia has been launching almost weekly bombardments of Ukraine in retaliation for another bold attack -- the Oct. 8 truck bombing of a vital bridge linking its mainland to the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nOn Monday, Putin tried to show his country could bounce back from that embarrassment by driving a car across the partially repaired bridge. Putin personally opened the 19-kilometre (12-mile) bridge in 2018 as part of an expensive effort to solidify his claim on Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nIn Monday's retaliatory barrage, missiles knocked out basic services in several Ukrainian regions in Moscow's strategy to inflict more pain just as winter approaches. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said four people were killed in Monday's barrage.\n\nUkraine's air force claimed it shot down more than 60 of the 70 missiles, and Zelenskyy again showed defiance, praising workers who immediately tried to restore power.\n\n\"Every downed Russian missile is concrete proof that terror can be defeated,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly address.\n\nUkraine said early indications showed Russia fired 38 cruise missiles from carriers in the Caspian Sea and from the southern Rostov region. In addition, 22 Kalibr cruise missiles were fired from Russia's Black Sea fleet, and long-range bombers, fighter jets and guided missiles were also involved, it said.\n\nElectricity provider Ukrenergo said its facilities had been hit, triggering some blackouts, although the prime minster said later that power facilities were damaged in only three areas, not as widespread as in previous attacks.\n\nIn the capital of Kyiv, scores of people quickly filled the central Zoloti Vorota metro station after air raid warnings. There were no immediate signs the city or surrounding region had been hit.\n\nUkrainian media reported explosions south of Kyiv, in Cherkasy, Krivyi Rih and Odesa. Officials said water, electricity and central heating were cut to many parts of Odesa.\n\n\"The enemy is again attacking the territory of Ukraine with missiles!\" Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian president's office, wrote on Telegram.\n\nIn neighboring Moldova, the Interior Ministry said on its Facebook page that border patrol officers had found a rocket in an orchard near the northern city of Briceni, near the border with Ukraine. A bomb squad went to the scene, but it was not immediately clear when the rocket fell or who fired it.\n\nIn detailing the attacks on the air bases, the Russian Defense Ministry said it had shot down two Ukrainian drones. It said three Russian servicemen were killed and four others wounded by debris, and that two aircraft were slightly damaged.\n\nThe attacks on the Engels base in the Saratov region on the Volga River and the Dyagilevo base in the Ryazan region in western Russia were part of Ukraine's efforts to curtail Russia's long-range bomber force, the ministry said.\n\nThe Engels air base houses nuclear-capable bombers and is located more than 600 kilometres (more than 370 miles) east of the border with Ukraine. The Dyagilevo air base, which houses tanker aircraft used to refuel other planes in flight, is about 500 kilometres (over 300 miles) northeast of the Ukrainian border.\n\nThe attacks showed the vulnerability of some of Russia's most strategic military sites, raising questions about the effectiveness of their air defenses if drones could come so close to them.\n\nThe ministry didn't say where the drones had originated, but Russian military bloggers said they likely were launched by Ukrainian scouts.\n\nRussian news agencies earlier had reported explosions at both sites, giving slightly different details than the Defense Ministry on casualties.\n\nZelenskyy's adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, trolled the Russians over the drone attack on Engels, stopping short of claiming responsibility.\n\n\"If something is launched into other countries' airspace, sooner or later unknown flying objects will return to departure point,\" Podolyak tweeted.\n\nIn other developments, Zelenskyy's office said three rockets hit his hometown of Krivyi Rih in south-central Ukraine, killing a factory worker and injuring three other people. In the northeastern region of Kharkiv, a person was killed in strikes by S-300 missiles on civilian infrastructure in the town of Kupiansk, it said.\n\nThe war that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has displaced millions from their homes, killed and injured tens of thousands of people and shaken the world economy -- driving up the price and curtailing the availability of food, fertilizer and fuel that are key exports from Ukraine and Russia.\n\nWestern countries on Monday imposed a $60-per-barrel price cap and a ban on some types of Russian oil, part of new measures aimed at stepping up pressure on Moscow over the war.\n\nThe Kremlin rejected the move, and Zelenskyy has criticized it as insufficient.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, in charge of energy, warned Sunday that Russia won't sell its oil to countries that try to apply the price cap.\n\n\"We will only sell oil and oil products to the countries that will work with us on market terms, even if we have to reduce output to some extent,\" Novak said.\n\nIn another step that took effect Monday, the 27-country European bloc imposed an embargo on Russian oil shipped by sea.\n\nRussia, the world's No. 2 oil producer, relies on oil and gas to underpin its economy, already under sweeping international sanctions.\n\n------\n\nEduardo Castillo in Kyiv, Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, and Andrew Katell in New York contributed.",

A recent report by the RUSI Institute tells why Russia decided it could pull it off (spoiler: they tested the wests reaction) and why it ultimately failed.\n\nA report published by the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) defense and security think tank has shone a light on Russias initial invasion plans, revealing how Russias strategic objective was the subjugation of the Ukrainian state and how the plans were formulated first and foremost by Russias special services and a small group of senior officials led by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe report, which details Ukraines strengths and vulnerabilities during the early phases of the war and what lessons can be drawn, includes in its first chapter details of Russias invasion plans \"as set out in captured copies of the orders issued to a range of Russian units.\"\n\nRussias invasion goal: destroying Ukraines national sovereignty and banning Ukrainian identity\n\nThe report notes that the goals of the Russian invasion included \"the destruction of national sovereignty and the banning of Ukrainian identity and demilitarisation, the destruction and banning of the UAF and the export to Russia of enterprises of the defense industrial complex of Ukraine, but also denuclearisation, the capture of nuclear power plants and their transfer to the direct management of Rosatom.\"\n\nThe authors of the report, which include Ukrainian Lieutenant-General Mykhaylo Zabrodskyi, former adviser to Ukraines Ministry of Defence and Foreign Intelligence Service Oleksandr V. Danyliuk, along with a pair of RUSI analysts, had exclusive access to Ukrainian military data and note that the underlying source materials for much of the report cannot yet be made public.\n\nTesting the waters\n\nRussias military build-up on Ukraines borders began in March 2021 when a greater force of conventional troops was added to existing forces along Ukraines borders. The rationale behind this move was to provide \"an opportunity for Moscow to assess the reaction of Ukraines international partners.\"\n\nHowever, the threat posed by this build-up was dismissed by Ukraines allies \"because they did not observe the necessary enablers deployed with the Russian formations nor the necessary political shaping of the information environment in Russia to support an invasion.\"\n\nThis in turn confirmed to the Kremlin that enablers could be brought to the formations faster than Ukraines partners could bring military capabilities.\n\nThe lack of deterrence on the part of Ukraines allies was an \"important reason for undertaking the full-scale invasion\" as it gave the Kremlin the confidence that \"it could invade Ukraine without significant international interference.\"\n\nThe report reveals that in July 2021, the 9th Section of the 5th Service of Russias Federal Security Service (FSB) was enlarged into a directorate and tasked with planning for the occupation of Ukraine. As part of the preparations, the FSB \"drew on extensive surveys carried out in Ukraine.\"\n\nNaivety and optimism bias: driving factors of the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nWhat follows next was confirmation bias of an industrial scale on the part of the FSB which has become routine in Russias political system. The surveys conducted by the FSB reportedly \"painted a picture of a largely politically apathetic Ukrainian society that distrusted its leaders, was primarily concerned about the economy, and thought an escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine was unlikely.\"\n\nCalling these reports inaccurate and false would be a gross understatement.\n\nRussias further confidence was shaped by assurances from General Valery Gerasimov who allegedly told international interlocutors on the outbreak of the war \"I command the second most powerful Army in the world.\" Separately, Gerasimov told counterparts in the United Kingdom that Russia \"had achieved conventional military parity with the US.\"\n\nThe authors findings reveal that Russias planning was riddled with naivety and optimism bias. For example, the assertion in Russian planning that Ukraine could only generate only 40,000 additional troops was premised on the \"anticipated speed of the operation rather than an appreciation of Ukraines capacity for mobilization.\"\n\nFurthermore, the \"assumption appears to have been that Ukrainian government officials would either flee or be captured as a result of the speed of the invasion.\"\n\nThis however never materialized. The day after the invasion, amid all the chaos, the Russian propaganda machine went into overdrive claiming President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had fled the country only for Zelenskyy to release his now infamous video proclaiming \"the President is here\" while flanked by Davyd Arakhamia, Andriy Yermark, Denys Shmyhal, Mykhailo Podoliak.\n\nPresident of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Prime-Minister Denys Shmyhal and other officials share video they are in Kyiv, stay with people. \"We are here, defending our state, and so it will be,\" Zelenskyy said. pic.twitter.com/JeTsRimXaK Euromaidan Press (@EuromaidanPress) February 25, 2022\n\nRussia had also \"anticipated that shock would prevent the immediate mobilization of the population and that protests and other civil resistance could be managed through the targeted disintegration of Ukrainian civil society.\"\n\nInstead, the vast majority of Ukrainians welcomed the announcement of general mobilization with civilians from all walks of life taking up arms to defend their land. Meanwhile, ordinary Ukrainians launched massive protests in occupied cities such as Kherson and Melitopol and although Russian troops eventually crushed the protests, the resistance movement went underground with organized partisan contingents spawning and mounting a guerrilla war against the occupying force.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1500529654268145670\n\nWargames to kill Euromaidan activists\n\nThe report reveals disturbing details of the FSBs tasks during the invasion reminiscent of the activities of its predecessor agency, the Peoples Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), during the Second World War and the immediate aftermath in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe FSB was tasked with capturing local officials and lists were compiled that divided Ukrainians into four categories:\n\nthose to be physically liquidated; those in need of suppression and intimidation; those considered neutral who could be induced to collaborate; and those prepared to collaborate.\n\nLeading up to the invasion, the FSB had conducted wargames with detachments of the Russian Airborne Forces to conduct kill-or-capture missions but \"in many cases, the purpose of capture was to put individuals involved in the 2014 [Euromaidan] Revolution of Dignity on trial to be executed.\"\n\nIn a hark back to Stalinist-era repressions, Russia had planned to use filtration camps to \"establish counterintelligence files on large portions of the population in the occupied territories.\" These filtration camps would have been used to determine whether Ukrainian civilians \"needed to be displaced into Russia, and to lay the groundwork for records to monitor and disrupt resistance networks.\"\n\nOver time, Russia had planned to completely eradicate any trace of Ukrainian identity, culture, and history by starting with bringing \"teachers and other officials [] to engage in the re-education of Ukrainians.\"\n\nWith regard to political control, there was a regional and national component.\n\nOn the national level , the objective was \"the murder of Ukraines executive branch and the capture of Parliament,\" while\n\n, the objective was \"the murder of Ukraines executive branch and the capture of Parliament,\" while on the regional level, Russia would have focused its efforts on \"coerced cooperation of regional governors and local authorities.\"\n\nWith Parliament firmly occupied by Russian troops, the pro-Russian parliamentary faction would have been encouraged to form a \"Movement for Peace\" that other factions would be coerced to support. Meanwhile, electricity, water cuts, and blockers on finance from the central bank would be used as leverage across rebellious regions.\n\nExtreme secrecy of Russian plans to invade and occupy Ukraine\n\nThe plans were reportedly \"drawn up by a very small group of officials and the intent was directed by Putin\" while many \"officials executed elements of the preparations were unaware of the wider intent.\"\n\nEven Russias military personnel \"up to deputy heads of branches within the General Staff\" were unaware that the intention was to invade and occupy Ukraine until days before the invasion while \"tactical military units did not receive orders until hours before they entered Ukraine.\"\n\nWhile the secrecy around the plans helped to achieve operational surprise (it also appears to have surprised the Russians themselves), the \"tiny pool of personnel involved contributed to a range of false assumptions that appear never to have been challenged.\"\n\nMany of the failures in the early phases of the war, such as the number of axes embarked upon, the small size of its force employed for many several tasks, and the failure to develop appropriate contingencies \"is indicative of many contributing technical judgments to the planning not having been fully briefed about the overall context.\"\n\nThe authors state that it appears \"no independent red teaming appears to have taken place\" and although the invasion plan, while theoretically plausible, was \"compounded optimism bias in each of its stages.\" Most tellingly, there is \"no evidence in the Russian planning that anyone had asked what would occur if any of its key assumptions were wrong\" and perhaps most consequential of all, none of the planning afforded any agency to Ukraine.\n\nKlaidas Kazak is a British civil servant and a graduate of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at University College London.\n\nNote: The report puts the rate of the success of Ukraines air defense at the onset of the invasion at 1218%. Since that time, it has increased significantly, up to 88%.\n\nFor more about Russias war plans, but from 2014-2016, see this RUSI report by Euromaidan Press editor-in-chief Alya Shandra:\n\nRelated:",

It doesn't take hours, but a few days.\"\n\nKey infrastructure was hit by Russia's Iran-made drones, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz is due to host an online meeting of G7 leaders on Monday, where further sanctions on Russia and Iran will be discussed.\n\nThe proposed measures would target Iran over its supply of drones to Russia, while the ninth package of Russia sanctions would place almost 200 more individuals on an EU sanctions list.\n\nBalitskyEV\n\nMoscow-backed authorities in Melitopol posted images of a fire\n\nIn Melitopol, pro-Moscow authorities said a Ukrainian missile attack had killed two people and injured 10. Images shared by a Moscow-installed official there showed a big fire.\n\n\"Air defence systems destroyed two missiles, four reached their targets,\" Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russia-installed governor of the city, said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nHe added that a \"recreation centre\" where people were dining had been destroyed in the attack, and that Ukrainian forces had used US-supplied Himars rocket launchers.\n\nThis weapon has played a key role in Ukraine's counter-offensive, being used to target locations away from the frontlines, including Russia's command posts.\n\nIvan Fedorov, Melitopol's exiled mayor, said scores of \"invaders\" had been killed.\n\nMelitopol has been under occupation since early March and is a major logistics hub for the Russian forces in the south-east.\n\nThe city, in the Zaporizhzhia region, is strategically located between Mariupol to the east, Kherson and the Dnipro River to the west, and Crimea to the south.\n\nUkraine says its efforts to retake occupied territory are continuing, despite the arrival of winter.\n\nFrank Gardner looks at what lies ahead as winter arrives in Ukraine.\n\nIn recent weeks, most of the fighting has taken place in the east of the country, especially around the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.\n\nBut on Saturday night, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Zelensky, indicated that Melitopol could be a main target of Ukrainian forces.\n\n\"If Melitopol falls, the entire defence line all the way to Kherson collapses,\" he said in an interview.\n\nIf that happened, he added, \"Ukrainian forces would gain a direct route to Crimea,\" the peninsula Russia annexed in 2014 and that the Ukrainians have vowed to retake.\n\nElsewhere, the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine came under fresh bombardment on Sunday. Images showed firefighters attempting to put out a blaze at a commercial building.\n\nUkraine has denied attacking the separatist-run city on many occasions during the war.\n\nEPA",

Following Russias retreat from the city of Kherson the only regional capital captured by Moscow since the start of Russian President Vladimir Putins invasion Ukrainian forces have limited options for their next big push to continue recapturing occupied territory and, ultimately, to expel the invaders.\n\nMuch attention is now shifting here, to the southern front line less than 100 miles north of the Sea of Azov, where Ukrainians are eager to sever the \"land bridge\" connecting mainland Russia to Crimea, which Russia invaded and illegally annexed in 2014. Kyiv is also intent on liberating cities such as Melitopol and Enerhodar, where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian forces, in turn, are digging into more fortified defensive positions, clearly anticipating a fight.\n\n\"Everyone is talking about Zaporizhzhia.

Instead, there was a surprise, lightning push in the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nFor now, Ukrainian soldiers in the Zaporizhzhia region appear to be in a bit of a waiting mode waiting, in muddy conditions, for the ground to freeze.\n\nIt was the coldest day yet for the Ukrainian soldiers stationed here, and the first day Dadak noticed the ground beginning to harden, he said. But the dirt was still slick enough for military vehicles to slide and get stuck. Dadak said he hoped that in the next couple of weeks their vehicles would gain more traction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout a mile from the front line, Dadak marched through a field toward a group of soldiers taking cover in the only place they could a thin row of leafless trees that did very little to block the biting wind. The bright sun was deceiving; temperatures had dropped near freezing. The soldiers took turns warming up in a dugout with a wood-burning stove and just enough room for two small beds.\n\nTheir main focus was to hold a defensive position, just behind the front line, and prevent the Russians from advancing north to the highway that connects Zaporizhzhia to the Donetsk region.\n\nBut the long-term goal, Dadak said, was to push south to the Sea of Azov . With the right momentum, Ukrainian forces could encircle the troops now on the east bank of Dnieper River after surrendering the city of Kherson and towns on the west bank.\n\nAbout 30,000 Russian troops are on the east bank of the river in the Kherson region, according to rough intelligence estimates, Dadak said.\n\nBut the immediate challenges are fierce. The ground is even muddier than in the Kherson region, Dadak said. And, after abandoning Kherson city, Russia redistributed its troops to the east, boosting its presence in Zaporizhzhia. Shelling has intensified ever since, Dadak and his soldiers said.\n\nRussias force density has increased, Muzyka said, meaning it has more troops per square mile than it had at the start of the war. \"So if Ukrainians do attack, it will not be easy,\" Muzyka said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWhile the relatively flat terrain and lack of rivers in the Zaporizhzhia region will make it easier for Ukraine to push south here, it will also give the troops fewer places to hide.\n\n\"I think that Ukrainians are probably looking at a couple of areas where they can potentially conduct a counterattack,\" Muzyka said. \"Zaporizhzhia is the most obvious one, which probably means it might not happen there.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the Ukrainian militarys long-term goals appears to be an offensive that cuts south to occupied Melitopol, said Michael Kofman, a Russian military analyst at the Center for a New American Security, a Virginia-based research group.\n\nThe Russian military has been preparing for a Ukrainian offensive in Zaporizhzhia since summer, Kofman said. The Ukrainians, however, carried out offensives in Kharkiv and Kherson, west of the Dnieper River.\n\n\"Whether they can do this sometime later in the winter or next spring remains very much a question,\" Kofman said.\n\nUkraine has sought to stabilize the line in the battered city of Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region, and a second set of forces is trying to push back the Russian military in the Luhansk region.\n\nThe question is whether Ukrainian forces have the available troops and artillery ammunition to pull off a southern offensive in the coming months, especially after taking casualties fighting in Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian towns closest to the front line appear nearly abandoned for most of the day, with residents emerging from their bunkers only in the morning, when Russian shelling briefly pauses. In the town of Huliaipole, famous for being the birthplace of Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary Nestor Makhno, a missile strike on city hall about a month and a half ago killed the towns deputy mayor and one of his aides. Another recent strike destroyed a large public library, leaving a mountain of rubble.\n\nSteps away, bags of sand surrounded a statue of Makhno, protecting it from the onslaught of shelling.\n\nDadak has seen the Russians using more helicopters here than they used to, he said. A nearby unit recently acquired rockets for the sole purpose of shooting down Russian helicopters.\n\nNearby booms of mortars and artillery have become more frequent, said a group of four Ukrainian soldiers based about a mile behind the front line, whom The Post agreed to identify only by their first names because of security risks.\n\n\"This is our situation, day and night,\" said one soldier, Volodymyr, who planned to head to the front line on Thursday, his 47th birthday. The shelling has become worse since the liberation of Kherson, he said, smoking a cigarette in a dark and cramped bunker.\n\nWith the temperatures dropping, Volodymyr said he wasnt worried about the winter. The military had been preparing the soldiers with plenty of warm gear, he said. \"The most important thing is to have a cold winter, not a muddy one,\" he said.\n\nMaybe then, the soldiers said, they could see some movement.\n\n\"The momentum in Kherson gave us a boost in morale and hope that we could also do something like that here,\" said another soldier, Ihor, 36.\n\nBut Serhii, 26, said he had no clue whether it would happen in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We could be here all winter,\" Serhii said.",

Video posted online showed two supports of the bridge had been damaged during the attack, just two days after Ukraine hit a Russian barracks sited in a resort in the city, with Himars rockets causing substantial damage and casualties.\n\nMore than 1bn was raised to support Ukraine this winter at the aid conference in Paris, Frances foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, said. The money, pledged by 46 countries and 24 international organisations, would be split between restoring Ukraines depleted energy network, the food sector, water supply, health and transportation, Colonna said.\n\nGenerators are as important as armour in helping Ukraine survive Vladimir Putins energy terror this winter, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Ukraine needed an additional 800m (686m) to survive the winter and 1.5bn to restore the long-term damage to the energy grid, its president told an emergency conference in Paris convened to coordinate infrastructure and humanitarian aid to the country over the next four months.\n\nUkrainian officials gave the all clear on Tuesday after air raid sirens blared across the country following warnings that Russia may carry out a new wave of missile strikes. Ukrainian media said the alerts may have been triggered by MiG fighter jets that took off from Ryazan, near Russias border with Ukraine, and flew towards Belarus.\n\nRussia and Ukraine pounded each others forces in heavy fighting in the eastern region of Donetsk on Tuesday. Moscow is battling to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, two of four territories the Kremlin claims to have annexed in votes rejected by most countries as illegal.\n\nThe town of Klintsy in Russias southern Bryansk region was shelled overnight by Ukraine, the regional governor claimed, adding that there were no casualties or damage. \"As a result of the work of the air defence systems of the Russian Armed Forces, the missile was destroyed, some parts hit the territory of an industrial zone,\" governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram.\n\nUkraine must take into account the new territorial \"realities\" that include Russias annexation of four Ukrainian regions, the Kremlin has said. Ukraines president said on Monday that Russia could begin to withdraw its troops from the territory of Ukraine to show they are capable of abandoning their aggression. In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there could be \"no question\" of Moscow beginning to pull out its troops by the end of the year.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will hold talks to discuss the events of 2022 in late December, the Russian business daily Vedomosti reported. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlins spokesperson, told the newspaper that the date and the agenda of the meeting are already known, but an official announcement will come later. The talks will unlikely be face-to-face, the paper said.\n\nThe Belarusian ministry of defence has announced a \"sudden combat readiness check\" of its troops. The exercises are mostly taking place in the north-west of the country, not close to Ukraines border. This is one in a string of announcements by Belarus since mid-October which Kyiv say is designed to stoke fear in Ukrainians and disinform Ukraines army.\n\nGermany will approve another 50m in winter aid for Kyiv following Russias missile attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure, Germanys foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said. She said Berlin was working to deliver generators, blankets and heating fuel to Ukraine over Christmas.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office announced it was sanctioning 12 Russian commanders for their role in attacks on Ukrainian cities. Those sanctioned include Maj Gen Robert Baranov, identified by Bellingcat as the commander of programming and targeting Russian cruise missiles, as well as four Iranians including the co-owner and managing director of MADO, an Iranian drone engine manufacturer.\n\nArms shipments to Ukraine will end as soon as peace talks to end the Russian invasion begin, Italys defence minister told parliament. \"I am aware that military aid will have to end sooner or later, and will end when we will have the peace talks that we are all hoping for,\" said the defence minister, Guido Crosetto, while addressing the upper-house Senate.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that there was an agreement on removing heavy weapons from Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. Talks were underway, he said, adding: \"We managed to protect Chornobyl and our goal is to protect Zaporizhzhia. The coming weeks will be crucial.\"\n\nRussias deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said he did not expect to have contacts with the US regarding further prisoner exchanges, Russian media reported. The White House said on Monday that senior US officials plan to hold talks this week with Russian counterparts to discuss the case of the detained American, Paul Whelan. Ryabkov was quoted as saying that he didnt know what the Americans \"have in mind\".\n\nUkraine has called for the west to supply Patriot missiles batteries and other modern air defence systems. The countrys prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, appealed to western allies on Monday amid growing concerns that attacks by Russia on its electricity grid could create a new wave of refugees.\n\nThe United States has shipped the first part of its power equipment aid to Ukraine, US officials said on Monday, as Washington works to support the countrys energy infrastructure against intensifying attacks from Russia. The first tranche was power equipment worth about $13m, one of the officials said. Another source familiar with the matter said two more planeloads of equipment would leave from the United States this week.\n\nThe head of Norways refugee council said he expects another wave of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine to go to Europe over the winter because of \"unliveable\" conditions. Millions of people in Ukraine have been left without heat, clean water or power amid plummeting temperatures, following Russian missile strikes on the countrys energy infrastructure.\n\nThe European Union reached a deal in principle to send an 18bn ($18.93bn) financial aid package to Ukraine and approve a minimum tax on major corporations in a big move that narrowed a rift between the bloc and recalcitrant member Hungary.\n\nEuropean Union governments on Monday struck a deal with Hungary that sorts out financial aid for Ukraine in 2023 and gains Budapests approval for a global minimum corporate tax, all in exchange for EU flexibility about funds paid to Hungary. The complex deal came after months of wrangling between EU institutions, member countries and Hungary and was spelled out on Monday by the council that represents EU member governments and by diplomats speaking anonymously.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged leaders of the Group of Seven nations on Monday to support his idea of convening a special global peace summit in winter dedicated to bringing peace to his country. Zelenskiy also appealed to the G7 nations for an additional 2bn cubic metres of natural gas as well as long-range weapons, modern tanks, artillery units and shells.\n\nRussian arms dealer Viktor Bout has joined the Kremlin-loyal ultranationalist Liberal Democratic party (LDPR), its leader said. Bout, once nicknamed \"the Merchant of Death\", was freed last week after 14 years in US custody in a high-profile swap with the American basketball star Brittney Griner. The move could see Bout seek a seat in the Russian parliament.\n\nThe exiled mayor of Melitopol claims Russian troops are \"redeploying\" and \"panicking\" following Ukrainian attacks on the Russian-occupied city over the weekend. Russian forces \"are busy moving their military groups to other places to try to hide them\", Ivan Fedorov said without providing evidence.\n\nUkraines deputy head of military intelligence has warned that Russia has enough missiles to launch another three to five waves of strikes on the country. Vadym Skibitsky also claimed Russia is using old Ukrainian missiles against Kyiv and outlined the four general directions from which Russia is launching missiles into Ukraine.\n\nTwo civilians have been killed and 10 more injured after Russian rocket attacks on the town of Hirnyk in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces struck the centre of the town \"with cluster munitions and Uragan MLRS [multilaunch rocket systems]\", the prosecutor generals office said.\n\nTwo people were killed and another five wounded after Russian troops shelled the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, according to local authorities. \"The enemy again attacked the residential quarters of Kherson,\" governor Yaroslav Yanushevich said on Telegram, adding the Russian forces hit a maternity ward, a cafe and apartment buildings on Saturday.\n\nUkraine has claimed to have struck a headquarters used by the paramilitary Wagner group in the occupied territories of the Luhansk region. Serhiy Haidai, the exiled governor of the Luhansk region, told Ukrainian television that a strike in the town of Kadiivka had led to a \"huge number\" of deaths among the mercenary group that has been accused of torture and other war crimes.\n\nVladimir Putin will not hold a year-end press conference for the first time in at least a decade, in what Kremlin watchers view as a break with protocol due to his war in Ukraine. There would also be no New Year reception at the Kremlin, officials said, possibly a decision influenced by the reluctance to celebrate because Russias war in Ukraine has not gone to plan.\n\nBritains defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he would be \"open minded\" about supplying Ukraine with longer-range weapons if Russia continued to target civilian areas. Wallace said he \"constantly\" reviewed the weapons systems the UK sends to Ukraine, and that he \"will be open minded to see what we do next\" if Moscow tries to \"break those Geneva conventions\", referring to agreed basic humanitarian principles during war.\n\nThe EU has secured enough gas for this winter but could face a gas shortage next year if Russia further cuts supplies, the European Commission and the International Energy Agency (IEA) have warned.\n\nAn international team of legal advisers has been working with local prosecutors in Ukraines recaptured city of Kherson to gather evidence of alleged sexual crimes by Russian forces. A team from Global Rights Compliance, an international legal practice headquartered in The Hague, are conducting a full-scale investigation part of a broader international effort to support overwhelmed Ukrainian authorities.\n\nA neo-Nazi paramilitary group linked to the Kremlin has asked its members to submit intelligence on border and military activity in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, raising concerns over whether far-right Russian groups are planning an attack on Nato countries.",

That will probably also mean an increase in their numbers in Germany,\" Mr Duda said following talks with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Berlin.\n\nMillions of Ukrainians fled after Russia invaded on February 24.\n\nThousands of people have died and dozens of cities and towns across Ukraine have been reduced to rubble.\n\nOn Monday, Russia shelling again mostly focused on eastern and southern regions that Mr Putin illegally annexed.\n\nTo defend against further strikes, Mr Shmyhal reiterated Ukrainian calls for Patriot surface-to-air missiles a highly sophisticated system.\n\nDuring the LCI interview, he also asked for more German and French air defence systems, resupplies of artillery shells and modern battle tanks.\n\nOrganisers in France expect more than 45 nations and 20 international institutions to take part in a Paris conference starting on Tuesday to raise and co-ordinate aid for Ukraines water, power, food, health and transportation needs during the tough winter months.\n\nProviding Patriot missiles to Ukraine would mark a major advance in the kinds of defence systems the West is sending to help the country repel Russian aerial attacks.\n\nSo far, no country has offered them, and such a step would likely mark an escalation in the fight against Russia.\n\nA US official told reporters on Monday that the Pentagon has no current plans to send Patriot missiles to Ukraine, but that discussions continue.\n\nA dog passes by an unexploded shell in Bakhmut (Andriy Andriyenko/AP)\n\nAir defences were also a topic of a phone call Mr Zelensky held on Sunday with US President Joe Biden.\n\nMr Zelensky, his office said, told Mr Biden \"about 50% of the Ukrainian energy infrastructure was destroyed\".\n\nMr Biden \"highlighted how the US is prioritising efforts to strengthen Ukraines air defence through our security assistance, including the December 9 announcement of 275 million dollars in additional ammunition and equipment that included systems to counter the Russian use of unmanned aerial vehicles\", the White House said.\n\nThe G7 leaders said in their statement that they have set an \"immediate focus on providing Ukraine with air defence systems and capabilities\".\n\nEven with their current systems, Ukrainian forces have already succeeded in intercepting missiles and drones, and a spokeswoman for the countrys southern armed forces, Natalia Humeniuk, said on Monday on Ukrainian TV that \"the effectiveness of anti-aircraft defence is 85%-90%\" against weaponised drones.\n\nUS officials agree with Ukraines reported success in shooting down drones and missiles, attributing the high kill rate in part to intelligence that the US and other allies are providing.\n\nRussian drones are still active.\n\nTheir

terms of inflicting suffering on a broad population\".\n\nHe described Russias actions as \"a crime, in terms of both aggression and a crime against humanity\".\n\nSlovakia said that in co-operation with Germany, it has opened a centre to repair Ukrainian howitzers and air defence systems of western origin.\n\nThe centre is located inside a military base in the town of Michalovce, some 35 kilometres (22 miles) west of the border with Ukraine, the EU member nations Defence Ministry said.\n\nIn Ukraine, the eastern Donbas region, which is made up of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, has again become a focus of intense fighting, particularly around the city of Bakhmut.\n\nUkrainian officials said on Monday the countrys forces hit a hotel in the Luhansk region that served as a headquarters of the Wagner Group, a private Russian military contractor and mercenary group that has played a prominent role in eastern Ukraine.\n\nA hole in the roof of the Catholic cathedral damaged

unused.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of the south-eastern town of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, reported that Ukraine also attacked a hotel that reportedly housed analysts from Russias top security agency, the FSB.\n\nMoscow did not comment on that claim, and none of the reports could be independently confirmed.\n\nRussian officials, meanwhile, accused Ukrainian forces of blowing up pillars of a bridge in a suburb of Melitopol on Monday night.\n\nVarious reports said Russian forces had been using the bridge to transport supplies and that traffic across it has now stopped.\n\nElsewhere, the Ukrainian prosecutor generals office said two civilians were killed and 10 were wounded in Russias shelling of the town of Hirnyk in the Donetsk region.\n\nKherson governor Yaroslav Yanushevych said a Russian strike on the southern city of the same name, which Ukraine reclaimed a month ago, killed two civilians and left five wounded on Monday.\n\nHe said the Russian shelling hit residential buildings and

                "cc_text": "In some of Evgeny Mezhevoy's darkest moments, like when he was interrogated and crammed into an overcrowded detention centre in Russian-occupied Donetsk, the single father imagined himself speaking to his three children, who he says were torn away from him at a checkpoint while trying to escape the Russian assault on Mariupol.\n\n\"I talked to each one of them. I calmed them down,\" Mezhevoy told CBC News in an interview from their two-bedroom apartment in Riga, Latvia, at the end of November.\n\n\"I said I would come for them and I'm still alive.\"\n\nThose inner conversations helped sustain him through weeks of fear and uncertainty, until the family could be reunited again.\n\nMezhevoy, 39, was separated from his children in April, when Russian soldiers on the outskirts of Mariupol noticed a Ukrainian military ID in his passport, which he received when he was employed as a mechanic.\n\nHe eventually ended up in prison, while the children were put on a plane to Moscow with the promise of attending a camp.\n\n\"I did not want to go anywhere. I knew this was no summer camp of any kind,\" said Mezhevoy's 13-year-old son, Matvey.\n\nMatvey and his two sisters, Sviatoslava, 9, and Alexandra, 7, are among more than 13,000 children Ukraine says were forcibly deported to Russia after it launched its invasion on Feb. 24.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of stealing some of its youngest and most vulnerable. Russia, on the other hand, is painting itself as the saviour of forgotten orphans.\n\nOn Nov. 12, Russia's children's rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, published this photo showing what she calls an evacuation from the Aleshkinsky orphanage in the Kherson region of Ukraine. (Maria Lvova-Belova/Telegram account)\n\nMany of the children reportedly sent to Russia came from orphanages in the occupied territories, but child welfare experts say the vast majority aren't actually orphans and were previously placed in care because their parents were unable to look after them.\n\nOther children, like the Mezhevoys, ended up in Russia after being forcibly separated from their families by soldiers at checkpoints, or through the chaos and violence of war.\n\nLife in war-torn Mariupol\n\nUkrainian officials have urged the UN and the G20 to get involved. International organizations say there is a great need for an independent body to verify Ukraine's data and work with both countries to locate the children and connect them with relatives who have scattered over the past nine months.\n\nAfter Russia launched its invasion, Mezhevoy and his children spent weeks huddled in basements in Mariupol, trying to stay alive as Russian soldiers lay siege to the southern port city.\n\nNear the end of March, they moved into a bunker in one of the city's hospitals, where they sheltered with more than 100 people. By then, Mezehevoy says the city was ruins and dead bodies lay on the streets. The only time they would venture outside was to fetch water.\n\nOne day in early April, Mezhevoy says Russian soldiers told everyone staying in the hospital bunker that they would have to leave. While some chose to stay, Mezhevoy packed up his children and boarded a minibus to a checkpoint.\n\nIt was there that soldiers saw his passport and eventually led him away from the children.\n\n\"It's terrifying not knowing where your kids are,\" he said. \"The unknown is the scariest.\"\n\nOver the next month and half, he was interrogated about his links to the Ukrainian military and asked whether he was affiliated with the Azov regiment, a unit that is part of Ukraine's National Guard, and which Russia accuses of Nazi sympathies.\n\nEvgeny Mezhevoy was eventually transferred to the Olenivka prison in the Donetsk region, which has hit in an attack in July. The attack happened after he was released. (Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters)\n\nMezhevoy said at times the detained men had to sleep standing up because the rooms were so crowded, and the unbearable heat meant most stripped down to their underwear.\n\nHe said he was punched a few times, when guards didn't like how he answered questions. He told CBC that some of the other men had dark bruises all over their bodies.\n\nSent to Moscow\n\nIn May, Mezhevoy was transferred to the Olenikva prison in the Donetsk region, which eventually became a holding cell for Ukrainian prisoners of war. It came under attack in July; Ukraine and Russia blamed each other for the strikes, which killed dozens.\n\nMezhevoy had been released by then. He said that on May 26, the guards there suddenly told him he could go, at which point he started making calls to track down his children.\n\nHe discovered that on the day after he was released, they had been put on a plane to Moscow, after spending weeks at different locations in Donetsk, including a cultural centre and a hospital.\n\nAfter receiving help from Russian volunteers, Mezhevoy made it to Moscow to pick up his children on June 19. (Submitted by Evgeny Mezhevoy)\n\nMezhevoy's son, Matvey, says that during their separation, he had no idea where their father was. At one point, the children put up a homemade poster saying they were looking for their dad.\n\nWhen they flew to Moscow, Matvey says they were on a plane with dozens of other children.\n\nThey were all sent to what the Mezhevoy family described as a heavily guarded site just outside of Moscow. The camp was named Polyana.\n\nThe Mezhevoy children told CBC that they didn't want to be there, but they didn't describe any mistreatment, and said they spent a lot of time relaxing.\n\nThey said officials there organized activities for them, including a dance party, which the children took a video of and shared with CBC.\n\nMatvey said that during their stay, they were given a number of medical examinations, including blood tests, as well as pills that he believed were vitamins.\n\nEven though the separation was difficult, Mezhevoy thought the children were better off staying where they were, until he could find a job and safe place to take them to.\n\nMezhevoy says Russian officials told him that the children would be brought back to Donetsk in a few weeks. But by mid-June, those plans changed, as intense fighting was still underway.\n\nOn June 16, Mezhevoy received an urgent call from Matvey. He told his father that a social worker said the camp was ending, and that if their father didn't pick them up soon, they were going to be temporarily taken to an orphanage or placed with a foster family.\n\nMezhevoy blames the Russian government for taking Ukrainian children but he doesn't blame ordinary Russians.\n\nWATCH | Putin deals with growing criticism of Ukraine invasion: Vladimir Putin works to fend off mounting criticism of Ukraine invasion Duration 2:16 Featured Video Russian President Vladimir Putin met with a hand-picked gathering of military mothers in an attempt to fend off mounting criticism of his latest troop deployment in Ukraine.\n\nIt was Russian volunteers that helped him quickly travel from eastern Ukraine to Moscow to pick up his children. These volunteers even paid for part of his journey.\n\nAfter proving his identity and filling out some paperwork, Mezhevoy was escorted into the camp for a tear-filled reunion with his children. It had been two months since he had last seen them at the Mariupol checkpoint.\n\nThe family then travelled to Riga, Latvia, where they have settled for now.\n\nRussia welcomes 'orphans'\n\nOn Russian state television and social media, officials have posted multiple videos of smiling Ukrainian children getting off planes in Moscow and being greeted by Russian foster families holding balloon animals.\n\nIn May, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree simplifying the process of obtaining Russian citizenship for Ukrainian orphans and children without parental care.\n\nOn July 5, when the first group of children became citizens, Russia's children's rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, posted a highly produced video of the ceremony.\n\n\"Now that the children have become Russian citizens, temporary guardianship can become permanent,\" she wrote on her Telegram account.\n\nLvova- Belova , who has been sanctioned by Canada and other Western nations, did not respond to CBC's request for an interview.\n\nThis fall, she announced that she herself had adopted a teenage son from Mariupol. She later described in a state television documentary that the moment she met him, she just felt \"he belongs to me.\"\n\nIn this photo posted by Russian children's rights commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, Ukrainian children receive Russian citizenship on July 5. (Maria Lvova-Belova/Telegram account )\n\nLvova-Belova has also posted images of children with severe health conditions being removed from an orphanage in the southeastern city of Kherson when it was still occupied by Russia forces.\n\nUkrainian officials are now collecting those kinds of images as evidence.\n\n\"It is very hard to particularly know where a child is, especially when we are talking about deportation ... by Russian military forces,\" said Maryna Lypovetska, who is with the Ukrainian NGO Magnolia. The organization looks for missing children, and has already received more than 2,600 appeals this year more than it had during its previous two decades of existence.\n\nLypovetska, who spoke to CBC by video call from Kyiv, said Magnolia gets a lot of messages about children who went missing in Russian-occupied areas.\n\nWhen Lypovetska sees social media posts about Russian families adopting Ukrainian orphans, she says she's infuriated, as many of the children aren't really orphans. Ukraine also banned all international adoptions during the war.\n\nEven if they have no parents, she says the kids might still have other relatives.\n\n\"They have rights. They're Ukrainian citizens,\" she said. \"They have a right to reunite with their own families.\"\n\nCall for independent investigation\n\nAccording to Aagje Ieven, secretary general for Brussels-based Missing Children Europe, Russia's actions so far suggest a plan to remove the children from Ukraine in order to take away their nationality and identity. She describes what is happening not as \"deportation\" but \"forced displacement.\"\n\n\"I think there is quite a lot of work to still be done in terms of proving what is actually going on,\" said Ieven, who says an independent party needs to verify the number of children sent to Russia, and then look at each individual to see whether they have parents or other family members.\n\nMaryna lypovetska is with the Ukrainian NGO Magnolia. She says her organization has received reports of more than 2,600 missing Ukrainian children since Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded. (Submitted by Maryna lypovetska)\n\nIeven says \"data and that level of proof\" would help in \"demonstrating that this is actually a war crime, rather than just Russia saving children.\"\n\nMezhovoy says a prosecutor from Ukraine has spoken with him about his case, and the children have met with a psychologist. CBC reached out to the office of Ukraine's Prosecutor General, but didn't receive a response.\n\nMezhevoy believes his kids are handling the stress of the past year well, but they do still get scared of loud noises and when they hear a plane.\n\nSitting inside the family's apartment, his daughter Sviatoslava says she was worried that if her father didn't get to Moscow in time, they would be adopted by a Russian family permanently.\n\n\"Nothing is short-term,\" she proclaimed while sitting on a top bunk, a reference to Russian claims of temporary guardianship.\n\nMezhevoy shakes his head when he is asked about the thousands of Ukrainian children who have apparently been sent to Russia.\n\n\"It is wrong,\" he said. \"I don't understand are there really so few homeless children in Russia, that they are taking ours?\"\n\nWATCH | Ukraine accuses Russia of taking thousands of children: Russia accused of taking thousands of Ukrainian children Duration 7:02 Featured Video The Ukrainian government says roughly 13,000 children, some with living family members, have been illegally taken to Russia since the war started.

A total of 10 explosions tore down the military infrastructure. Footage captured at the scene shows the military quarters engulfed in a fierce blaze.\n\nAnother video of the strike shows several bodies amid the ruins while rescue workers are trying to intervene. The attack, carried out with Himars rockets, obliterated a former resort and hotel complex next to a church in the city known as the Hunters Halt, which had been turned into barracks for Russian soldiers. Local residents said around 200 Russians were wiped out in the attack. Some sources claim over 300 were killed. The injured were reportedly taken to Crimea for medical treatment, due to local hospitals being at full capacity. Ivan Fedorov, Melitopol's mayor, said on his Telegramm channel: \"According to preliminary estimates, about 200 occupiers were roasted. \"Wounded orcs (Russians) are immediately taken to Crimean hospitals, because there are already enough places in Melitopol hospitals. However, pro-Russian authorities said the missile attack had killed just two people and injured 10. \"Air defence systems destroyed two missiles, four reached their targets,\" Yevgeny Balitsky, the Moscow-appointed governor of the occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region, said on Telegram. He added that a \"recreation centre\" where people were dining had been destroyed in the Ukrainian attack with Himars missiles.\n\nUkrainian strikes destroyed Russian barracks in the occupied city of Melitopol\n\nRussian barracks were destroyed in the Ukrainian attacks, with Russian casualties reported by Ukrain\n\nOther explosions were reported in other Russian-occupied regions like Crimea in cities including Sevastopol and Simferopol. Vladimir Putin issued veiled threats, warning any attacks on Russian-controlled territories would be met with a military response with all of Russia's means. Despite the threat, Ukrainian troops have resolved to retake all the lost territories, including Crimea which was lost to Russia in 2014. The latest Ukrainian attacks come as 1.5 million people were cut off from electricity on Saturday after Russia used Iranian-made drones to target all non-critical infrastructure in the Ukrainian port of Odesa. In response, the Ukrainian army said it shot down 10 drones.

The ones that got through struck two power facilities, Ukraines prosecutor generals office said, according to Reuters. The prosecutors office said the drones were Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones.\n\n\"Due to the scale of the damage, all users in Odesa except critical infrastructure have been disconnected from electricity,\" Odesa Mayor Gennadiy Trukhanov wrote on Facebook.\n\nBetween Friday and Saturday, the Ukrainian military General Staff reported about 20 airstrikes and more than 60 rocket attacks across Ukraine.\n\nGeneral Staff spokesperson Oleksandr Shtupun said more than 20 populated places came under fire in the Bakhmut district, scene of the most active fighting.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy said the situation \"remains very difficult\" in several front-line cities in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk provinces.\n\n\"Bakhmut, Soledar, Maryinka, Kreminna. For a long time, there is no living place left on the land of these areas that have not been damaged by shells and fire,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address Friday, naming cities hardest hit.\n\nIf Russian forces capture Bakhmut, they could cut Ukraines supply lines and open a route to Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, key Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk, according to The Associated Press. Russia has battered Bakhmut with rockets for more than half of the year, and shifted troops there for a ground assault after Ukraine drove them from Luhansk in July.\n\nMoscow has \"actually destroyed Bakhmut, another Donbas city that the Russian army turned into burnt ruins,\" Zelenskyy added in his Friday night address.\n\nSince October, Moscow has been targeting Ukraines power grid. Kyiv acknowledged Friday that every thermal and hydroelectric power plant in the country had been damaged.\n\nZelenskyy says the attacks are war crimes targeting civilian life, while Moscow claims they are militarily legitimate.\n\nThe chief of the National Police of Ukraine, Ihor Klymenko, said Saturday that 47,000 Russian war crimes have been recorded in Ukraine since the start of the February 24 invasion. The number includes the torture, rape, and murder of civilians.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is determined to conquer parts of Ukraine and shows no restraint in his brutality, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at an event in Potsdam near Berlin, Saturday. But, he added, it is still important to keep a channel of communications open in case an opportunity arises to end the war.\n\n\"We are of completely different opinions. Nonetheless, I will keep speaking with him because I want to experience the moment where it is possible to get out of this situation. And that's not possible without speaking with one another,\" he said, according to Reuters.\n\n\"We have seen the brutality the Russian president is capable of,\" Scholz said. \"In Chechnya, where he basically eradicated the whole country. Or in Syria. There is no restraint there, it's as simple as that.\"\n\nScholz also defended his government's aim to raise defense spending to NATO's goal of 2% of gross domestic output. He said NATO countries needed to be strong enough that nobody would dare attack them.\n\nRussia-Iran military partnership\n\nIran has become one of Russias top military backers since the invasion of Ukraine, according to the British Defense Ministry intelligence update posted on Twitter Saturday.\n\nIrans support of Russia is likely to grow, the ministry said, because \"Russia is attempting to obtain more weapons, including hundreds of ballistic missiles. In return Russia is highly likely offering Iran an unprecedented level of military and technical support that is transforming their relationship.\"\n\n\"Russia has highly likely expended a large proportion of its stock of its own SS-26 Islander short range ballistic missiles, which carry a 500kg warhead up to 500km,\" the ministry said. \"If Russia succeeds in bringing a large number of Iranian ballistic missiles into service, it will likely use them to continue and expand its campaign of strikes against Ukraine's critical national infrastructure.\"\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday that the administration was deeply concerned about the \"deepening and burgeoning defense partnership\" between Iran and Russia, and that the United States would be using its tools to disrupt that relationship.\n\nU.S. aid to Ukraine\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden authorized a new round of $275 million in military aid for Ukraine, offering new capabilities to defeat drones and boost air defenses, according to a memo released Friday by the White House.\n\nThe package also includes rockets for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers made by Lockheed Martin, 80,000 155 mm artillery rounds, Humvee military vehicles and about 150 generators, according to the memo.\n\nVOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.

                "cc_text": "LODZ, Poland (AP) A meeting of Europes largest security organization opened Thursday with foreign ministers and other representatives strongly denouncing Russias war against Ukraine, a conflict that is among the greatest challenges the body has faced in its nearly half-century of existence.\n\nAlong with the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which was founded to maintain peace and stability on the continent, has provided a rare international forum for Russia and Western powers to discuss security matters.\n\nBut since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the 57-nation OSCE has become another venue where the bitter clash between Russia and the West has played out, exposing the organizations own inadequacies in helping to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe two-day ministerial meeting in Lodz, Poland, is its first since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Notably absent was Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who was banned from entering Poland. The country is the current chair of the OSCE and a member of the 27-member European Union, which put Lavrov on a sanctions list.\n\nLavrov denounced the ban and Poland on Thursday.\n\n\"I can say responsibly that Polands anti-chairmanship of the OSCE will take the most miserable place ever in this organizations history,\" he said. \"Nobody has ever caused such damage to the OSCE while being at its helm.\"\n\nRussias permanent representative to the organization, Alexander Lukashevich, led the Russian Russias delegation to Lodz instead of Lavrov. Lukashevich denounced the Western countries after a string of statements condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\n\"What weve heard in this hall today only reinforces one sad thought: the West is deliberately devaluing the tools of diplomacy, firmly taking the path of confrontation,\" he said.\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau said he had a responsibility to defend the OSCEs \"fundamental principles,\" and argued that it was not Poland but Russia which has hurt the organization by blocking budgets, appointments and other critical aspects of its functioning. All decisions must be adopted by consensus.\n\n\"I would say its outrageous to hear Russia accusing the chairmanship of pushing the OSCE into the abyss, destroying its foundations and breaking its procedural rules,\" said Rau, who oversees Polands chairing of the organization.\n\nThe OSCE acted as a mediator in Ukraine before Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It helped negotiate peace deals for eastern Ukraine following a Russian-backed separatist war that began in the Donbas region in 2014. In March, the OSCE discontinued its special monitoring mission to Ukraine.\n\nAlso missing from the meeting in Lodz was Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei of Belarus, who died suddenly last weekend at the age of 64 and was buried earlier this week. Belarusian authorities didnt give the cause of Makeis death, and he wasnt known to suffer from any chronic illness, triggering speculation about possible foul play.\n\nA Belarusian representative, Andrei Dapkiunas, delivered remarks that he said were prepared by Makei before his death. He deplored the exclusion of Lavrov, saying it \"is killing the OSCE,\" and accused Western powers of undermining Europes security structure with what he described as their unfair isolation of Russia and Belarus.\n\nPeter Szijjarto, the foreign minister of Hungary, which is in the unusual position of being an ally of Poland while maintaining close economic and diplomatic ties with Russia, appeared to fault Poland for excluding Lavrov.\n\n\"Channels of communication must be maintained,\" Szijjarto said.\n\nSzijjarto told the meeting that Hungary wants peace in Ukraine, but he didnt mention Russia by name.\n\nThe OSCE was established in 1975 and became a platform for dialogue during the Cold War. An emphasis on human rights and economic development undergirds its approach to security. It is known for its monitoring of elections but has also carried out conflict prevention and post-conflict peace-building missions in places such as Bosnia, Moldova, Georgia and Tajikistan.\n\nThe U.S. representative, Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, said she came away from the gathering in Lodz with a renewed optimism, noting that 55 of the OSCEs 57 members Russia and Belarus excluded were finding new ways to work to defend democratic principles.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin \"has failed to defeat Ukraine,\" Nuland said. \"Despite his brutal war of aggression, his war crimes, and now his vicious fight against civilians trying to freeze them in the middle of winter, Putin has also failed in his effort to divide and destroy the OSCE.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow APs coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

There were no immediate reports of casualties. Credit Credit... Laura Boushnak for The New York Times\n\nKYIV, Ukraine Russia attacked Ukraines capital, Kyiv, before dawn on Wednesday with a swarm of 13 Iranian-made drone, most of which were shot down by Ukrainian air defenses, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe morning attack on the capital followed similar strikes on the Black Sea port of Odesa over the weekend that seemed to end a weekslong pause in Russias use the weapons.\n\nTwo government buildings in Kyiv and at least four homes in the region surrounding the capital were damaged, officials said, but it was unclear whether they were hit by direct strikes or falling debris from drones shot out of the sky. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine praised the air defense systems in a brief video message published on the Telegram messaging app and said that all of the drones appeared to have been shot down.\n\nKyiv and other parts of Ukraine have been subject to Russian missile attacks that have taken out power and other infrastructure as the country heads into the cold winter months.\n\nKyrylo O. Budanov, the head of Ukraines military intelligence agency, told Ukrainian media in October that Russia had used about 330 Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in the war against Ukraine, of which 222 had been shot down.\n\nMr. Budanov said Russia had ordered about 1,700 drones, which were being delivered in batches of 300 at a time. It was not possible to independently verify the claims, but they correspond with estimates from Western officials and military analysts.\n\nThe first sound that Yaroslav Vinokurov, 24, heard Wednesday shortly before 6 a.m. was the wailing of the air-raid alarm in the darkness. He continued to get ready for work, given that alarms sound nearly every day. But soon machine-gun fire echoed through the Shevchenkivskyi district as air-defense systems flashed in the sky, followed by what he described as \"a very loud explosion.\"\n\n\"I lay down on the floor, as I didnt know what else can happen,\" Mr. Vinokurov said. Only once it was quiet did he go outside.\n\nThe roof of a nearby government building was damaged, and debris littered the area. \"My car is destroyed,\" he said, looking over the damage.\n\nResidents rushed to put sheets, blankets and whatever else they could find onto damaged windows to protect themselves from the bitter cold. It was 23 degrees Fahrenheit well below freezing when the sun rose about 7:50 a.m.\n\nJust two days before the strikes, Yurii Ihnat, the spokesman for Ukraines Air Force, warned that Russian forces were now using attack drones at night. If the drones are launched during the day, he said, Ukrainians can use large-caliber machine guns and other small arms to shoot them down. But in the darkness, they need expensive and limited air defense missile systems that can track the incoming drones by radar.\n\nEven in the darkness, residents of the capital have become familiar with the sounds of Russias unrelenting aerial bombardment.\n\nMaria Varenikova and Victoria Kim contributed reporting.",

We worked to solve one\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\nWhen I first heard about the dead man in the street, I didn't know his name.\n\nIt was just a story, about a possible war crime, committed in the first days of the Russian invasion into Ukraine. The victim was a Ukrainian man, allegedly murdered by Russian soldiers and left dead in the street next to his blown-up car, near a place called Nova Basan.\n\nAt first the story about this man stood out because it was different. He'd apparently been a member of the French Foreign Legion at some point. And perhaps, I'd thought, that could mean clues and investigations maybe even consequences far beyond the tiny village where he died, 50 miles northeast of Kyiv.\n\nBut as I spoke with investigators and human rights advocates about this case and many others, I came to see, as they have, just how elusive justice could be for any of the 50,000 alleged war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nGiorgi Gogia, a Human Rights Watch investigator who first told me about the case, said he'd been documenting so many crimes he didn't have time to investigate this case any more.\n\nAnd Oleksandra Matviichuk, who heads the Center for Civil Liberties, one of the recipients of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, said she had started thinking of war crimes as mere statistics.\n\n\"I started to use numbers instead of names,\" she said.\n\nI wanted to focus on a name instead of a number, to put a face to all the apparent crimes but also to gauge whether justice is possible. If I could solve even one murder learn about the victim, what happened, who was responsible maybe it would reveal how likely accountability is for all of them.\n\nTo understand that story, I decided again to focus on just one the story of the dead man in the street, near Nova Basan.\n\nThe villages of Nova Basan and Bobrovytsia\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Narciso Contreras/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Narciso Contreras/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nI first visited Nova Basan in May, about a month after Ukrainian forces liberated the village from Russian control. It was a small community, surrounded by farmland, with a population of fewer than 3,000.\n\nBefore the war, families would leave their homes in Kyiv to spend their summers there.\n\nNow, the burned-out hulls of Russian tanks lined the road.\n\nIt wasn't hard to find the scene of the killing: Everyone in the village knew where it was. Two men standing near an abandoned tank gestured down the road to where the man's car still sat along the highway, like a memorial to the violence inflicted by the Russian invasion in late February.\n\nThe car, a French-made Citroen, was a sickly white color, badly burned, with incinerated parts lying haphazardly around. Much of the front of the car was gone, torn away by an apparent explosion. Rust had begun to set in.\n\nAnd the man's body was no longer there.\n\nWe headed into the center of the village, past the destroyed local caf and a looted supermarket, to the town hall to see local administrator Mykola Dyachenko. In his office, where the window still had a bullet hole from the fighting, he told me what he knew.\n\nIt wasn't much. The man was killed as Russian forces entered the village on Feb. 28, Dyachenko said. He had, indeed, been a French legionnaire at one point, but he'd served his contract and returned home to Ukraine before the war began.\n\nDyachenko didn't know the dead man's name, but he knew his mother, Oksana Breus. She lived in another village, Bobrovytsia, about a 30-minute drive away. She invited us over to discuss her son.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\nWhen we arrived, she welcomed us into her home and put a photograph of her son on the table between us as we sat in the kitchen.\n\nHer son's name was Oleksandr, she said. Oleksandr Breus. He had been killed in the first week of the war at the age of 28.\n\n\"He was going to Kyiv to pick up his sister and his fianc. He wanted to take them to France,\" Oksana told us. She didn't know the details about how he died, and said she didn't want to know. But she had a video of the scene, taken the day of Oleksandr's death, which had circulated on social media.\n\nShe played it for us, then started to cry.\n\nThe video showed the same burned-out car we'd seen earlier, with a large hole in the back door on the driver's side. The camera pans right to show a man's body on the ground by the car, his right arm curled across what remains of his head. It looks like an execution.\n\n\"The Russians drove through, damn it,\" said the man recording the video. \"Poor thing.\"\n\nOksana was too distraught to continue talking and suggested that we talk to Oleksandr's sister for more details. As she showed us out, walking into the yard, she stopped to show us one more thing.\n\nIt's a German shepherd with sad eyes, sitting inside an enclosure Oleksandr's dog, Clifford.\n\n\"Such a handsome dog,\" she said. \"Do you see how much he misses him?\"\n\nInvestigating a war crime\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\nAs we watched the video Oksana showed us the apparent explosion, the violence inflicted on Oleksandr it seemed clear he was killed by military weaponry. Given what else we knew, that would make Oleksandr's killing almost certainly a war crime committed by Russian forces.\n\nIn the video, Oleksandr is dressed in civilian clothing: a brown jacket. There is no evidence that he was armed, and his family said he had no weapons.\n\nHis car was facing west, toward Kyiv. That suggests that when it was destroyed, it was facing away from the direction Russian forces were advancing.\n\nAnd if he had died Feb. 28, as his mother, the town administrator and others had all told us, there was little chance that his killing had been the result of actions by Ukrainian forces. Every person we talked to in Nova Basan told us that the Ukrainian military, caught off guard by the initial invasion, was not present in or around Nova Basan when Oleksandr was killed.\n\nWar crimes are governed by a number of international laws and treaties. But there are local laws as well. In Ukraine's criminal code, there is a specific statute that addresses war crimes, something that falls to people like Vadym Prymachok to investigate.\n\n\"We're looking at murder. We're looking at torture. We're looking at looting. We're looking at harm to civilians,\" said Prymachok, a senior official in Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation.\n\nWe showed Prymachok the video of Oleksandr and the car.\n\n\"To give you my opinion, this is a very clear case of a war crime ... in the sense that they saw who he was. They had a chance to not fire,\" Prymachok told us. \"There was no threat that he was posing against any of the Russians that were in his vicinity.\"\n\nPrymachok told us that he was not in charge of investigating the Oleksandr Breus case. So we traveled to the city of Chernihiv, the capital of the region where Oleksandr was killed. Serhiy Vasylyna is the head of the regional prosecutor's office there.\n\nWhen we visited him, not far from the Belarusian border, he listed the challenges he faced as an investigator and prosecutor in a time of war.\n\nHe didn't have enough investigators or medical experts. The ones he had couldn't access the sites of alleged crimes because of continued fighting. And most people in his office had spent their careers as civilians, with little experience with the intricacies of investigating and prosecuting war crimes.\n\nAnd then there was the issue of the sheer size of the caseload.\n\n\"My prosecutors, we are spending 24/7 on these 1,300 cases,\" Vasylyna told us in July.\n\nOleksandr's case was just one that overwhelmed investigators were juggling. Vasylyna said they were doing their best to learn more and would be in touch if they had more information.\n\nWho was Oleksandr Breus?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\nI first met Oleksandr's sister, Anya Breus, in the conference room of a hotel in downtown Kyiv. She was eager to tell us of her warm memories, classic stories of mischievous siblings.\n\nLike the time she broke the ceiling lamp in their home.\n\n\"I told him, do not [tell] mom. ... He said, 'I will not tell her if you will wash dishes for two weeks,'\" Anya recalled, laughing. \"Yes, it's a funny story.\"\n\nOleksandr Breus was also a fierce Ukrainian patriot, others said. Though he could speak Russian, he often refused to in order to prove a point.\n\n\"For him, it was important to separate us from them,\" said close friend Sasha Hrushko.\n\nOleksandr would go online to the website Chatroulette to debate Russians about history and to point out what he saw as the differences between Ukrainians and Russians.\n\n\"He always watched videos about Ukrainian history. He told us all the time that Russians are awful people,\" Anya recalled.\n\nThose who knew him best say Oleksandr was also somewhat restless. His hobbies were varied: He was the captain of his college basketball team; he loved photography and the art of capturing memories; and he spent long days out on the road riding his bicycle.\n\nHe even had a brief stint as an amateur rapper.\n\nHe had an agriculture degree, but no clear path for the future. There were a lot of grand ideas with one friend, he discussed setting up a thrift store; with another, the prospect of opening up a bar.\n\nIn 2018, he joined the French Foreign Legion to find discipline and a stable job.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\n\"He was looking for himself,\" Hrushko said. \"He was looking for some realization. That's why he just found ... himself in the French Legion.\"\n\nA career in the military suited Oleksandr well he thrived in stressful situations.\n\nBorys, a French Foreign Legion colleague who requested that his last name be withheld since he is still in the legion, called him calm and collected. \"He was able to deal very easily with tough situations,\" he said. \"He was very levelheaded, coolheaded.\"\n\nOleksandr was in the legion for four years. But Borys said that after Oleksandr aggravated an old injury during an obstacle course, he was forced to work an administrative job.\n\nUltimately, Oleksandr left the French military in late 2021 after getting permanent residency status in France.\n\nBorys also told us about Oleksandr's girlfriend, Yulia Pohyba.\n\nOleksandr and Yulia had tried to have a long-distance relationship while he was in France, but it wasn't easy. Living in Ukraine, she interpreted his application for French permanent residency as a sign he wasn't serious about her.\n\nOleksandr decided to return to Ukraine, about a month before the Russian invasion began, in an attempt to repair the relationship. They began to reconcile, and Oleksandr began seriously talking to his friends about marriage.\n\n\"I am sure that he wanted to propose,\" Borys said.\n\nTrapped in Bobrovytsia\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn Feb. 24, Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nWith his girlfriend safe in the suburbs of Kyiv, Oleksandr left for his childhood home in Bobrovytsia, along with his dog, Clifford. The dog didn't get along with Yulia's dog, so his plan was to drop him off and head back to the capital city a two-hour drive to evacuate his girlfriend and sister to western Ukraine and, eventually, out of the country.\n\nBut the Ukrainian government suddenly instituted a multiday curfew in Kyiv, essentially trapping him in place and preventing him from driving back. The uncertain, anxious situation brought him to tears.\n\n\"He was disappointed because he wanted to [get] to Yulia as soon as possible. And he stayed at Bobrovytsia for two days,\" his sister Anya said. \"That was the first time I heard him cry on the phone.\"\n\nAll the while, a long line of Russian armored vehicles and troops rolled down the same highway that Oleksandr would eventually need to take to Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian forces, outnumbered and caught off guard, tried whatever they could to slow Russian progress. One local Ukrainian official said that in a neighboring town to Nova Basan, the Ukrainian military blew up a bridge to halt the Russian advance. He also said Russian soldiers killed six civilians as they passed through the town.\n\nOther civilians told us the same thing, describing senseless executions of unarmed locals who just happened to be walking by.\n\nThen, on the morning of Feb. 28, four days into the invasion, Ukrainian officials lifted the curfew in Kyiv.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Maxar Technologies/Getty Images Maxar Technologies/Getty Images\n\nOleksandr began his journey to the capital.\n\nAnd so did the Russian forces.\n\nRussian troops enter Nova Basan\n\nYulia Gozhak, a resident of Nova Basan, told us she went out that morning to get some groceries with her adult son. She had heard that the bakery had fresh bread that morning.\n\nBut as she shopped, her son burst into the store.\n\n\"Mom, forget about the bread!\" he said. \"Let's go! I can hear tanks shooting near the brick plant!\"\n\nThe two jumped into her car, with her son at the wheel. As they raced out of the village, they arrived at an intersection: the road to Bobrovytsia, the direction Oleksandr was traveling from.\n\nChaos erupted as she drove through the intersection. Russian armored vehicles were stationed on the far side, and when they saw the car, they opened fire.\n\n\"I didn't see any tanks. I just heard shots and saw the smoke,\" she said.\n\nThe front window shattered as bullets penetrated the inside of her car. Gozhak covered her face with her hands, and a bullet struck the phone she was carrying and ricocheted into her hand.\n\nGozhak managed to make it up the road to her home.\n\nTraveling the other way, Oleksandr was about to drive through the same intersection.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe killing of Oleksandr Breus\n\nOleksandr had left his childhood home around 8 a.m., shortly after the curfew in Kyiv was lifted. His mother said she saw him off he was wearing a pair of white Nikes and loose-fitting green pants. While he was driving, his father, Mykola, called to check on him.\n\n\"I asked, 'Where are you?' [Oleksandr] said, 'I am at a checkpoint and see a [Russian armored] column,'\" Mykola later recalled.\n\nHe urged Oleksandr to turn around.\n\n\"That's the only thing we talked about and that's the last time we spoke,\" Oleksandr's father said.\n\nSomewhere between 9 and 10 that morning, a number of people in the village say they heard an explosion.\n\nTetiana Baryshovets works at a local supermarket that closed early as Russian forces pressed deeper into the village. Locals hid in their homes, sometimes their basements, as troops entered Nova Basan, but Baryshovets says she decided to make a dash home on her bicycle.\n\nPedaling home she saw a car on fire, with a body lying next to it, in the middle of the road.\n\n\"I stopped. I wanted to check if he was alive,\" she said. \"But it was obvious that he wasn't. I didn't see the head, but the hand and legs were twisted unnaturally.\"\n\nPictures would later confirm that Oleksandr's green pants were partially burned off, exposing blackened flesh below the knee. His white Nike sneakers were gone the fire had apparently burned them off.\n\n\"I started trembling, thinking, 'Why would they kill a person like that?'\" Baryshovets recalled. \"I started crying.\"\n\nShe also came to the stark realization that she could have shared Oleksandr's fate. It was all timing: Had Oleksandr arrived a short while earlier he might have been able to pass through before Russian troops arrived. Had he come later, he might have been prevented from passing through at all.\n\nThat evening, Anya Breus launched a search for her brother. No one had heard from him all day. She began posting on social media.\n\nWhen Hrushko saw the post, he expected the worst.\n\n\"At that moment, I really understand for myself that he's probably dead,\" said Hrushko, \"because [it only takes] 2 hours [to get] from Nova Basan to Kyiv.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\nA stranger passed Anya Breus the video of the crime scene, which had been circulating on social media. She forwarded it to Hrushko, who had no doubt that it was Oleksandr in the video.\n\n\"Just seeing his body, it's enough,\" Hrushko said. \"I mean, there is nothing to be discussed. You just just feel it.\"\n\nIt took us months to piece together what had happened to Oleksandr, and we knew much more than when we started. We knew who he was, why he was on the road, and roughly when he died. We found his home, his family and had even heard recordings of his voice.\n\nBut still, we knew almost nothing about the essential question for war crimes prosecutors: How, precisely, was he killed?\n\nFor that, we needed an eyewitness.\n\nA single eyewitness emerges\n\nNova Basan local administrator Mykola Dyachenko doubted that anyone had seen the killing.\n\n\"I don't know about eyewitnesses. Probably there weren't any,\" he said. \"When the Russians entered our village, people were not coming outside.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\nMany locals said they deleted messages, photos and social media posts as the Russians rumbled into the village, worried their phones would be confiscated by the occupying force.\n\nThe owner of the gas station across the street from where Oleksandr died turned off his surveillance cameras before Russian troops invaded the town, town officials told us. The cameras at the nearby supermarket were no help either, because Russian forces took the hard drives when they occupied the town.\n\nIn many cases, we learned, Russian troops allegedly destroyed evidence that would show who was there. We canvassed houses in Nova Basan for potential eyewitnesses, but many homes weren't occupied.\n\nIt felt like a dead end until, one day, a man approached us to say: \"I hear you've been looking for me?\"\n\nThe man's name was Oleksandr Holod. We'd knocked on his door before, but he hadn't been home.\n\nThis time, he invited us in. His place, which stood across the street from the wreckage of Oleksandr's vehicle, was dusty and dark inside. No electronics, no carpeting. After the war began, Holod had moved out.\n\nHolod said he was an eyewitness to the killing and started describing what he saw on the morning of Feb. 28, the column of Russian armored vehicles descending on his village.\n\n\"I simply heard the noise, the increasing noise, they're coming ...\" he began.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\nBut before he could finish the story, the door flew open and a woman burst into the home. Laryssa Anatolievna, a shopkeeper we'd interviewed the previous day, was incensed that we were talking to Holod.\n\n\"I came here to tell the truth to the people, to tell the truth that you collaborated with the [Russians],\" she said. \"You drank with them; you were freely moving around on your bicycle. Tell me! Didn't it happen?\" she shouted.\n\nHolod defended himself, saying he was one of the few from the area who actually stayed during the occupation. Anatolievna didn't stay, he said.\n\n\"I saw everything with my own eyes here,\" Holod said, adding that he only cooked for Russian soldiers during the occupation, and only because they forced him to.\n\nI asked Holod to continue. Dashing from window to window, he described what he saw on the day Oleksandr was killed.\n\nSoldiers left their armored vehicles, known as BTRs, and spread out through the neighborhood as Russian forces moved in, he said.\n\n\"The first column that I saw [had] five BTRs,\" he said.\n\nHe saw a car coming from the direction of Bobrovytsia. Oleksandr's car. The same burned-out Citroen that remained outside his home.\n\nThree BTRs were ahead of the car on the road, and Oleksandr pulled alongside the fourth.\n\nHolod said he saw Oleksandr stop and get out of the car.\n\n\"He started to quarrel with them about something,\" Holod said. \"He started to say to them something like 'What are you doing here?' and 'Why are you doing this?'\"\n\nAs Oleksandr talked, two soldiers positioned themselves behind him down the road. One had a machine gun, Holod said. The other one the tall one had an assault rifle.\n\nWithout warning, the tall one opened fire from about 50 meters away.\n\nHolod said he saw a flash of blood from Oleksandr's head as he fell to the road. Then the closest BTR turned its turret toward Oleksandr's car and fired a round from its main gun.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\nHolod's description of what happened on the morning of Feb. 28 matches other evidence we gathered. The hole in the side of Oleksandr's car could have been where the Russian armored vehicle fired into it. The direction of blood splatter indicated the shooting started from the approximate direction Holod described.\n\nAnd Holod's version of events matched the details shown in videos of the scene taken on the day of the killing videos Holod says he'd never seen. This last claim also seemed plausible. Holod didn't have a smartphone.\n\nHolod's testimony became the centerpiece of our understanding of Oleksandr's death, because it fit with all of the other details we learned.\n\nDetails like what happened to Oleksandr's body.\n\nOleksandr's body lies in the street\n\nTwo days after Oleksandr was killed, Tetiana Baryshovets, the woman on the bicycle, returned to the scene. She couldn't bear the thought of Oleksandr's body lying in the road.\n\nBut someone she didn't know who had gotten there first. There was a light cloth over Oleksandr's body, she said, and some bricks to hold it in place. She's haunted by the memory.\n\n\"I can't get it out of my mind because ... I see it every time I go to and from work,\" she said.\n\nRussian forces fully occupied the village of Nova Basan during this time. Residents say there were no Ukrainian forces nearby. And they describe Russian soldiers committing atrocities without resistance.\n\nNina Nahorna, a teacher in Nova Basan, said that shortly after they entered the village, dozens of Russian soldiers were in her yard, acting like they owned the place.\n\n\"One of them ... told us that he had already killed six civilians,\" she said. \"And then we realized that they didn't care if we were civilians or not. We realized that these people have lost touch with reality.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\nVillagers report a number of civilians killed in Nova Basan besides Oleksandr.\n\nMykola Dyachenko, the local administrator, was detained and subject to a mock execution.\n\nIt was a grinding and brutal period for the villagers.\n\n\"They are not humans, do you understand? They are monsters,\" said 86-year-old Oleksandra Lyska, whose chickens were killed, provisions were taken away and home was destroyed. \"They are terrible people. Terrible.\"\n\nOleksandr's body remained on the street for a month during the period of Russian occupation. Family members say it was just too dangerous to retrieve him.\n\n\"We were told that Russian soldiers did not allow anyone to be buried,\" said Anya, Oleksandr's sister. \"My mother told me that there was also one 14-year-old boy who was killed. His mother went to them, kneeling, and was asking them for permission. But they were shooting over her head and sending her back.\"\n\nStill, Oleksandr's mother contacted the Nova Basan town council every day to see if they were allowed to retrieve the body. But the Russians imposed strict restrictions on movement and were prone to opening fire to clear vehicles and civilians off the road.\n\nThen, in early April, Ukrainian forces made their way back into Nova Basan after a ferocious battle. It was finally possible to retrieve Oleksandr's body.\n\nSerhii Tsyba said that recovering bodies was the way he contributed to the war effort.\n\n\"I have no fear,\" Tsyba said. \"My father always taught me that you don't need to be afraid of the dead. Be afraid of the living ... I cannot help the soldiers. I will be helping people so that ... they have everything to go on their last trip.\"\n\nOn the 4th of April, Tsyba's assignment was to go to the recently liberated village of Nova Basan.\n\nHis hands began shaking as he replayed the memory. This time, he knew who he and his colleague were picking up. It was his friend Oleksandr, whom he called by his nickname, Sasha. They had grown up together in nearby Bobrovytsia.\n\n\"[My colleague] told me who we were picking up when we were driving down. I told him that I really knew Sasha, and that's why I took it so hard,\" he recalled.\n\nTsyba was responsible for taking photos of the scene. Wild animals had torn at Oleksandr's body. Tsyba then helped lift the body into a coffin.\n\nThere's a photo of Oleksandr's mother, Oksana, arriving on the scene, wracked with grief.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Serhii Nuzhnenko/Reuters Serhii Nuzhnenko/Reuters\n\nOleksandr Breus was brought to a small cemetery, down the road from his childhood home, and was buried on April 6, 2022. The sight of his dead friend's body, lying out in the cold for a month, triggered something in Tsyba that would last much longer.\n\n\"Anger,\" said Tsyba. \"I've never felt anything like it. Fear turned into anger, and hate. Because we never attacked anyone; we just lived our lives.\"\n\nThe perpetrators\n\nWhile searching for more witnesses to the events in Nova Basan, we found one more video that showed Russian forces moving through the village on the day Oleksandr was killed. We reached out to the person who posted it on Facebook, who told us her mother took the video.\n\nAnd that's how we found ourselves walking into a furniture store in Kyiv, where Olena Bondarenko works as a manager.\n\nAfter the war started, Bondarenko fled the capital city for the home her family owned in Nova Basan, hoping there would be less fighting in the small village. On the morning of Oleksandr's death, she stood outside in a state of shock as armored vehicles rolled by.\n\nShe showed us another video that she took of passing Russian troops. An armed soldier appears in the frame and aims a rifle at her causing her to gasp before firing off shots in her direction. Bondarenko drops to the floor and her father pulls her away.\n\nBut later, she noticed something unusual about the vehicles on the video.\n\n\"They were new tanks with the letter 'O,'\" she explained. \"On TV, they were only talking about 'Z' and 'V.' I told the Ukrainian military about these vehicles with the letter 'O.' They were totally different. It was a different type of armored vehicle and they wore a different colored uniform.\"\n\nWe didn't know it then, but Olena Bondarenko's videos were crucial to understanding which Russian units were on the ground.\n\nThe first clue was those \"O\" markings.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Olena Bondarenko/Screenshot by NPR Olena Bondarenko/Screenshot by NPR\n\nWe developed sources in Ukrainian intelligence agencies, police, and their prosecutorial offices and showed them what we'd found.\n\nThey couldn't tell us conclusively which units were in Nova Basan that day. But they told us the letter \"O\" meant the vehicles were units from Russia's Central Military District.\n\nThey also provided us with a list of Russian units that might have been in Nova Basan when Oleksandr was killed.\n\nWe turned to people who track military equipment by scouring all the information that's publicly available: Tom Bullock, a now-former analyst at Janes, a company that monitors militaries all around the world; and George Barros, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nWitnesses said the Russian troops in Nova Basan were not wearing insignia or patches that would identify who they were or where they came from.\n\nBut both Bullock and Barros said Bondarenko's video showed a specific kind of armored vehicle called a BTR-82A.\n\nThis model of armored vehicle was a crucial clue. Among the list of units our sources had provided, only a small number had this equipment.\n\n\"The fact that we can identify that that's a BTR-82 Type A is significant because there's only two brigades [in Russia's Central Military District] that actually field that equipment,\" Barros said. \"And those are the 15th Brigade and the 30th Brigade.\"\n\nRussian military doctrine suggests that these BTRs, and these brigades the 15th and 30th would have been used for clearing operations.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Serhii Nuzhnenko/Reuters Serhii Nuzhnenko/Reuters\n\nClearing is a task that militaries do when they're going into a contested area to ensure that it's safe,\" Barros explained. And he sees evidence of that mission in Bondarenko's videos.\n\n\"They're walking down the main stretch of the village, what it looks like, and they're checking, you know, house to house. They're peeking over fences. And what they're probably doing is a clearing operation,\" he said.\n\nBy identifying the two units that were most likely in Nova Basan, we dramatically narrowed down the number of suspects. The Russian military deployed a ground force of about 120,000 people to Ukraine during its initial invasion.\n\nThe two units we had identified, the 15th and 30th brigades, had far fewer soldiers: about 4,000, Barros said.\n\nOur eyewitness Holod said he saw five BTRs in the immediate vicinity when Oleksandr was killed. Each vehicle has a capacity of 10 soldiers.\n\nSo if our reporting bears out, the killer was among a group of about 50 people, from the 15th or 30th brigade, who passed through the intersection in Nova Basan between 9 and 10 a.m. on Feb. 28. He was tall and carried an assault rifle.\n\nBut we'd reached our limit. We couldn't get the actual names of those 50 men, much less the tall one with the rifle.\n\nWe could name one potential defendant in a war crimes case, though: the Russian military officer responsible for the units that were there.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Serhii Nuzhnenko/Reuters Serhii Nuzhnenko/Reuters\n\n\"It's very clear that at that point in time in Nova Basan we saw significant elements in that area likely commanded by Russian Colonel General Alexander Lapin,\" Barros said, relying on open-source information.\n\nAlexander Lapin was in command of the men who seem to have killed Oleksandr and blown up his car.\n\nKnowing his name could be significant: If all of the killings and shootings around Nova Basan are compiled, and if investigators could argue that the atrocities were systematic and widespread, they could pin responsibility for those crimes on the commander. They could prosecute him for war crimes.\n\nThere are other pieces of evidence still to be uncovered. For instance: A few months ago, we met with the investigators in charge of Oleksandr's case, who said they were looking at cellphone records for both his phones and the phones of Russian soldiers who were in the area.\n\nAnd there could be other records of who was at the intersection. Roman Avramenko heads the Ukrainian nongovernmental organization Truth Hounds, which documents and investigates war crimes.\n\n\"Maybe in a year or in 10 years, Russia will break down and the Ukraine investigators would be obtaining a full list of soldiers being deployed to different areas,\" Avramenko said.\n\nAs for Oleksandr's status as a French permanent resident, we asked a top human rights lawyer if the French government would investigate the case. She told us Oleksandr doesn't qualify for a war crimes investigation in France because he was not a citizen. The French Foreign Legion ignored my request to meet and discuss the case, except to say that he left the legion in 2021.\n\nWe looked into the possibility of the International Criminal Court taking on the case. International law clearly outlaws killing unarmed civilians. But we quickly found that the ICC doesn't usually pursue cases like Oleksandr's.\n\n\"Normally they focus on the high-level commanders and functioneers who issue orders, and they focus on the cases with [prominent or large numbers of] victims ... or with mass destruction. So most probably the ICC would not take this case,\" Avramenko explained.\n\nIt falls to Ukrainian investigators to show that individual war crimes are part of a larger pattern.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\nThat's the goal of Ukrainians like Vadym Prymachok, the senior official at the Ukrainian State Bureau of Investigations, who named the Russian minister of defense, president and generals as officials he'd like to eventually bring to justice by showing \"systemic war crimes,\" he said.\n\nBut the Ukrainian system is swamped.\n\nWe'd spent months conducting close to 100 interviews and developing sources throughout Nova Basan and the Ukrainian government. And, at least for now, we couldn't narrow it down any further.\n\nOleksandr's death was just one alleged war crime. There are some 50,000 under investigation across Ukraine.\n\nEven those who have been working on investigating war crimes for years are pessimistic about finding any full measure of justice.\n\n\"Frankly speaking, I think it's not possible to establish justice for all the cases of war crimes committed in the course of full-scale invasion,\" Avramenko said.\n\nFour months after Oleksandr was killed, we went with his sister and mother to visit his grave. There were violets around the dirt mound where his body lay at rest.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy for NPR Carol Guzy for NPR\n\nThat day, Oleksandr's mother told us one more thing about her son: that last year, while flying home to Ukraine, he had a layover in the Netherlands.\n\n\"He knows that I love flowers. He had some spare time and bought me tulip seeds,\" she explained. \"I planted them last autumn, and this year 10 out of 10 all of them bloomed.\"\n\nThey bloomed precisely on Mother's Day, she said, about two months after Oleksandr's death.\n\nThe audio for this story was produced by Monika Evstatieva; edited by Barrie Hardymon and Robert Little; digital production by Meg Anderson; research by Barbara Van Woerkom; photo editing by Emily Bogle; visuals and graphic editing by Nick McMillan and Nick Underwood.

                "cc_text": "Summary\n\nOn October 10, Victoria Amelina, a prize winning author, sent out a series of urgent tweets. \"Im in Kyiv and alive,\" she started off, explaining that she was filming Russian strikes on Kyiv as best as she could. She tweeted out a list of the buildings damaged or destroyed during the attack, including the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, the Khanenko Museum, Kyiv Picture Gallery, National Philharmonic of Ukraine, Maksymovych Scientific Library, and Kyiv City Teachers House. Her anguish at these losses and her understanding of why they had been targeted was crystal clear: \"I know they want us, Ukrainian writers, to disappear . . . they target Ukrainian culture.\"\n\nCulturepast, present, and futureis on the front lines of the brutal war on Ukraine and cultural erasure is a central tactic of Russias campaign of aggression and violence in Ukraine, which has gone on for over eight years. Russian President Vladimir Putins repeated false claims that a distinct Ukrainian history, language, and culture do not exist, serve as one of his central justifications for waging war on and occupying Ukraine. He seeks not only to control Ukrainian territory, but to erase Ukrainian culture and identity, and to impose Russian language, as well as a manipulated, chauvinistic, militaristic version of Russias culture, history, and worldview, on Ukrainian people.\n\nOleksandra Yakubenko, currently working on PEN Americas efforts to support Ukrainian artists at risk and an expert on Ukrainian culture, thinks that Putins efforts to destroy Ukrainian culture have had the opposite effect. She explained how her Ukrainian identity was \"reawakened\" in 2014 in the aftermath of the Maidan Revolution that ousted President Viktor Yanukovychwhat Ukrainians call the Revolution of Dignityand following Russias occupation of Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Since then, she noticed \"cultural life just bloomed and bloomed.\" She ascribed this strengthening, in part, to the vitality of Ukraines cultural sector and their participation in and support for democracy and human rights, and later the war effort. She now believes that \"our culture and our physical survival are intertwinedthey go hand in hand.\"\n\nIn an interview from July 2022, the Ukrainian novelist, poet, and essayist Yuri Andrukhovych shared similar views on Ukrainian culture and writing as a bulwark against Russian aggression: \"Its quite ironic that each attempt Russia has made to destroy Ukrainian culture has had the opposite effect . . . There is now a widespread tendency among Ukrainians to speak entirely in Ukrainian . . . New poems, novels, stories, essays, etc. will be written in Ukrainian, and of course they will be read and discussed. It is the best way to overcome the Russian aggressors and to survive in that humanitarian catastrophe they have brought upon us.\"\n\nRussia has carried out extensive, coordinated actions to marginalize, undermine, and ultimately eliminate the tangible and intangible manifestations of Ukrainian culture since its illegal occupation of Crimea, and parts of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russias actions, which included damaging important cultural buildings and undermining the teaching of and in Ukrainian in those territories, now serve as a blueprint for their cultural erasure efforts in areas they have invaded and occupied since the full-scale war against Ukraine began on February 24, 2022. They have been supplemented by physical destruction of cultural infrastructure on a massive scale.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Russian government has sought to destroy Ukrainian culture. Ukrainian thinkers, writers, linguists, artists, and scholars over the last three centuries have faced Imperial Russian and Soviet efforts to deny, assimilate, and eliminate their culture and language. Olesya Khromeychuk, a historian and director of the Ukrainian Institute in London, detailed efforts by various Russian tsars to eliminate Ukrainian culture, including banning Ukrainian-language publications, prohibiting cultural societies, and exiling or imprisoning public intellectuals. She explained that \"writers, poets, and artists became the figures who shaped national identity.\"\n\nDeliberate attacks on culture, including efforts to erase culture, by state and non-state actors, are not new. The bombing of Guernica, a Basque town in northern Spain, by the German air force in support of General Franco during the Spanish Civil War; the systematic destruction of Polish libraries and archives by the Nazis during World War II; attacks on cultural heritage sites, including Palmyra in Syria, by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are among the better-known efforts to destroy and erase culture during wars. In 2016, the International Criminal Court (ICC) handed down its first conviction of a war crime \"consisting in intentionally directing attacks against religious and historic buildings in Timbuktu, Mali.\"\n\nThe occupation and war have wrought an incalculable toll on Ukraines cultural voices, creators, and workers. They are amongst the thousands killed and injured by Russian attacks, or detained and threatened by Russian forces. Many have fled their homes and communities to reach safety; they have lost loved ones, homes, and precious possessions. They have been cut off from their creative communities and colleagues, and they have seen their studios, galleries, and exhibition spaces destroyed, damaged, and closed. The need to focus on survival has frequently taken precedence over creative work and even when Ukrainian culture is not being deliberately targeted, the war has deeply disrupted creative production.\n\nRussian bombardments and other attacks have destroyed and damaged hundreds of places where Ukrainians enjoy and experience culture, sites small and large, local and national, from community cultural houses to fine art museums. Some of these attacks were deliberate, targeted attacks, such as on Mariupols Academic Regional Drama Theater, which was sheltering hundreds of civilians, including children, when Russian aircraft dropped two bombs on it in March 2022. In the Kyiv region, in the first days of the Russian assault, a Russian missile struck the Ivankiv Historical and Local History Museum, setting it on fire, the only building in the village to be struck during that time.\n\nRussian forces have also repeatedly and indiscriminately attacked densely populated areas using explosive weapons and cluster bombs, which have been banned by an international treaty. These attacks have caused widespread death and injury, as well as massive destruction and damage to civilian infrastructure, including cultural heritage sites, book printing houses, libraries, and places of spiritual interest. The damage and destruction cannot be seen as simply incidental, collateral damage resulting from Russian military operations targeting Ukrainian military targets. Rather, the magnitude of the destruction suggests a deliberate campaign to destroy civilian infrastructure, rendering some cities barely habitable, and an attempt to destroy civilian morale.\n\nBoth the targeted and indiscriminate attacks carried out by the Russian military against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine are violations of International humanitarian law (IHL) and, per the findings of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, actions by Russian forces amount to war crimes. The conduct of Russias military and occupation forces also violates international human rights law, including Ukrainians right to culture.\n\nUkrainian writers, poets, artists, and cultural defenders demonstrate remarkable resilience and resistance in the face of this brutal conflict and attack against their Ukrainian culture. Many draw strength from their connections to Ukrainian culture and are actively seeking new ways to produce and promote culture. Writers are writing wartime diaries. There are literary readings in bookstores against the backdrop of air-raid sirens, and concerts in metro stations doubling as bomb shelters. \"Good Evening (Where Are You From?),\" also known by its popular name, \"Good evening, we are from Ukraine,\" is a song by the electronic duo ProBass and Hardi. It was released just before the start of the war, and it now plays in bomb shelters; the phrase is printed on T-shirts and trends on Twitter, and is often used by officials, including Vitaliy Kim, the governor of the southern region of Mykolaiv, when they address the Ukrainian people, signifying and strengthening Ukrainian resilience. Many believe that the survival of Ukraine as a country and people is inextricably linked with the survival of its culture, and they carry that burden with them. Tamara Shevchuk, a painter, graphic designer, and art teacher, works in a village in the Kyiv region that was occupied by the Russians for 24 days. She said: \"War does not spare anyone, and the cultural front is just as important as the military one.\"",

Markus Schreiber/Associated Press\n\nBERLIN The leaders of the worlds wealthiest nations on Monday pledged their unwavering support for Ukraine as they agreed on elements of a new system to funnel short- and long-term funding to a war-torn nation facing a bitterly cold winter and continued Russian aggression.\n\nThe Group of 7 leaders vowed to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia \"for as long as it takes\" and aimed to convene a meeting of a new donor coordination platform next month.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, who is currently heading the Group of 7 nations, said the plan aimed to help Ukraine with its immediate financial survival as well as reconstruction efforts in the years to come from the widespread devastation wrought by the Russian invasion.\n\n\"The aim is now to rapidly build this platform with the participation of Ukraine, international financial institutions and other partners,\" Mr. Scholz said at a news conference after the meeting. \"The reconstruction of Ukraine will be a human task that is perhaps comparable to the Marshall Plan\" a reference to a U.S.-financed project to help Western Europes economic recovery after the ravages of World War II.\n\nThe G7 leaders also called on their finance ministers to meet in the near future, along with the International Monetary Fund, to coordinate support to Ukraines budget for 2023.\n\nPlans for reconstruction and financial support to Ukraine have been nebulous for months, and an October meeting in Berlin yielded few concrete proposals. Ukrainian representatives arrived at the meeting well prepared with data and plans for their reconstruction bids, while Western leaders were far less organized, participants at the time said.\n\nOn Monday, G7 leaders made some efforts to push donor plans forward, saying they would set up a secretariat for the platform and that each member nation would designate a \"senior government representative to oversee the set up of the platform and ongoing coordination efforts.\" Those representatives should \"convene as soon as possible in January 2023,\" the leaders said.\n\nUkrainian leaders have encouraged support for reconstruction but have also been pressing for immediate financial aid to fund their fight against Russia.\n\nIn a speech to the G7 on Monday, Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky, thanked the countries for their continued support but listed financing for weapons first among his requests.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Russia still has the advantage in artillery and missiles,\" he said. He requested additional artillery, as well as modern tanks equipment that Ukraine has repeatedly asked for, along with fighter jets and longer range missiles.\n\nMr. Zelensky cited economic and social resilience as the countrys second biggest need. \"We must be more active with reconstruction,\" he said. \"It will clearly demonstrate the true capabilities of the democratic system to the whole world.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian leader also asked Western donors to send gas to Ukraine, which has been suffering severe power shortages following a wave of Russian attacks on the countrys energy grid, leaving many Ukrainians in the dark and cold.\n\nIn announcing the agreements on a donor platform, G7 leaders pledged to create a so-called Finance Tracker in an attempt to prevent or limit having funds siphoned off by corruption. Donors also have said they will attempt to put some funding into Ukraines private sector in the hopes of keeping it functioning despite the war.\n\n\"Unwavering solidarity with Ukraine and concrete support for Ukraine is a common thread throughout our presidency,\" said Mr. Scholz. \"We will continue for as long as it is necessary. We have reaffirmed that today.\"",

Trench warfare has long been a feature of the battle in eastern Ukraine for the Donbas region. Ukrainians fight from their own trenches on their side of the line near Popasna, where Russians are waging an intense campaign to dislodge Ukrainian troops from the city of Bakhmut.\n\nBut the pace and the scale of Russian construction over the last couple of months is unmatched. All of the structures in the image above appeared within six days.\n\nThe fortifications show how Russias military is trying to set up more robust, defensible positions against Ukrainian pressure, often with the help of natural obstacles like rivers.\n\nLast month, Ukraine recaptured a large amount of territory in the south, including the regional capital of Kherson, pushing Russian forces across the Dnipro River. The river serves as a natural barrier, and Russia has built an enormous series of defensive obstacles south of the river to discourage Ukraine from crossing it.\n\nA map of Ukraine showing territory occupied by Russia, and where fortifications have been detected.

Or once they get there, not just keep running,\" Mr. Wasielewski said. \"These are just holes in the ground unless they are held by motivated, disciplined soldiers, who are supported by artillery, mobile reserves and logistics.\"\n\nTo better understand Russias fortifications in eastern Ukraine, The Times analyzed satellite radar data on physical changes to the earths surface. That data, along with high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet Labs, reveals multiple rows of Russian defenses lining major highways just behind the Russian frontlines.\n\nA map of defensive fortifications near the city of Popasna, in eastern Ukraine.

Basemap data by OpenStreetMap The New York Times\n\nRussia remains on the offensive near Bakhmut, slamming the city with artillery and slowly gaining ground to the east and south of the city over the past two weeks. The new construction provides several defensible positions to retreat to, should the Ukrainians counterattack.\n\nThat could help Russia avoid a repeat of its costly withdrawal from the Kharkiv region in September, when it lost thousands of square miles of territory and was forced to abandon military equipment.\n\nOne network of Russian defenses near Popasna was constructed in just 11 days.

In a Telegram post on Dec. 6, Igor Strelkov, a Russian former intelligence officer, said the decision to build long-term structures had been made \"on a whim.\"\n\n\"Following the strategy of a protracted war is suicide for the Russian Federation,\" he said.\n\nWhile trench warfare is associated with the major wars of the 20th century, trenches and obstacles can still play an important role in modern warfare by shaping where an enemy can attack, said Ben Barry, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\n\"The whole idea of defensive positions is to get an advantage by being able to fight from prepared positions,\" Mr. Barry said.\n\nThe Soviets used these types of defenses to successfully defend against a German attack on the city of Kursk during World War II. Moscow views this as the model of a Russian defensive battle, Mr. Barry said.\n\n\"They knew the Germans were attacking there. So they built defenses in great depth and had many belts of obstacles and minefields and belts of defense and also powerful reserves,\" he said.\n\nBut trenches have modern weaknesses as well. Many of them are being built out in the open, within striking distance of Ukrainian artillery, making them especially vulnerable to being spotted by drones.\n\nConstructing these defenses so near to Ukrainian forces has very likely led to heavy Russian casualties near the town of Svatove in eastern Ukraine, Britains Ministry of Defense said in a statement.\n\nAn analysis published in late November by the Institute for the Study of War, an American research group, showed that Russia also built defensive positions deep in southern Kherson in October before it ordered a withdrawal from territory north of the Dnipro River.\n\nA map showing defensive structures built by the Russians in Kherson Oblast.

New structures have been spotted more than 50 miles from the Dnipro River, which now serves as a natural barrier between the two sides.\n\nMilitary experts said that Russia is likely moving to the defense in Kherson so it can redeploy forces to more active fronts in the war, such as Bakhmut.\n\nEven so, it is a signal that \"the Russian military leadership views the prospect of a Ukrainian counteroffensive across the Dnipro River as a serious threat,\" according to an assessment by the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nUkraine has already made an amphibious landing on a strategically vital peninsula at the mouth of the Dnipro River. Known as the Kinburn Spit, the peninsula could serve as a base for Ukrainian attacks deep into Kherson, so Russia has heavily fortified a two-mile-wide strip of land separating the spit from the mainland.\n\nNew fortifications in Kherson Novotroitsk Tarasivka Velyka Blahovischenka Novooleksiivka Source: Satellite images by Maxar Technologies, Nov. 15, 2022 The New York Times\n\nMany of the fortifications are designed to protect supply lines that connect southern Kherson to Crimea, the peninsula that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Losing even one of the two main highways \"would likely strain Russian logistics supporting operations\" in eastern Kherson and western Zaporizhia, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nDefensive positions can be seen every five miles on the major M14 highway that runs from Kherson to Melitopol, a city in the Zaporizhia region that Russia captured in the early days of the war.\n\nA satellite image showing a section of the M14 motorway with multiple fortifications built by the Russians.

Russia mobilized hundreds of thousands of fresh recruits in September, but many of them arrived on the battlefield poorly trained and unequipped.\n\nRussia has likely deployed these new recruits to frontline defenses in Kherson, saving more experienced troops for secondary positions, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War wrote late last month.\n\n\"Manning Russian frontline fortifications with these less effective, less organized, and poorly equipped and supplied personnel could lead to them collapsing or falling back faster than Russian military leadership may have planned,\" the analysts wrote.",

The plan is awaiting approval by the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, before it is sent to President Joe Biden for his signature. Approval is expected, two US officials and a senior administration official told CNN. Once the plans are approved, the Patriots are expected to ship quickly and Ukrainian forces will be trained to use them at a US army base in Grafenwoehr, Germany, officials said. The Patriot defence system is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles, CNN writes. It can potentially shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside Ukraine. As Russian forces have launched waves of missile and drone attacks across Ukraine, Kyiv has pleaded with its western allies for additional, sophisticated air defence systems. Recent attacks on Ukraines civilian infrastructure have put renewed pressure on the Biden administration to send these systems.

Moscow is preparing to mount a major offensive at the start of 2023 as it continues to attack Ukraines energy infrastructure, Kuleba said. Speaking to reporters from a bomb shelter in central Kyiv, he said: I think the Russian capability to conduct an offensive, maybe a large offensive, may be restored somewhere by the end of January, February. Thats what theyre trying to do. And we, of course, do everything possible to prevent it from happening. Russia \"definitely still hopes they will be able to break through our lines and advance deeper in Ukraine\", he said, pointing to \"the conscription they have announced, and the training of new conscripts, and the movement of their heavy weapons across the country\". He said Vladimir Putins goals had not changed since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, and called on western allies not to listen to the Kremlins \"empty statements\". He said: No one should be fooled. Russia has not changed its ultimatums and still wants to conquer all of Ukraine. What they want right now is not peace, but a pause in aggression to continue it later. We will not play this game. Ukraines immediate concern was restoring electricity to the entire country following waves of Russian missile attacks on crucial infrastructure which aimed to \"destroy the Ukrainian energy system and leave millions of people without access to power, water and heating amid freezing temperatures\", he said. Putin hopes that without power, water and heating, Ukrainians will stop resisting and accept Russian ultimatums, but this is a grave miscalculation.

Whether it be its daring window displays or that 2001 TV advert featuring Kylie Minogue riding a velvet bucking bronco, the brand has stirred up some strong emotions. But it had not, until now, been accused of inadvertently helping to finance a war in Europe. An Agent Provocateur-branded store in Moscow in September 2021. Photograph: Abaca Press/Alamy The continued presence of Agent Provocateur-branded stores in Russia has, however, politicised the peekaboo bras, barely there corsets and sex toys, as the company has been placed on a database of firms that are said to be at risk of aiding and abetting Russian aggression, albeit unwittingly. The Leave Russia project at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) argues that \"international companies may exercise their influence by putting economic pressure and refusing to cooperate with the aggressor\". Otherwise, it is argued, they add value to the Russian economy. There appear to be 10 Agent Provocateur franchise stores in Moscow, as listed on agentprovocateur.ru, a Russian-language website. Typically, a franchisee pays a royalty in order to operate under a brand name and sell its products. Denis Dovgopoliy, a prominent venture capitalist in Ukraine who has backed efforts to persuade western firms to leave Russia, said a franchise model allowed \"Russian entrepreneurs to build businesses and pay taxes\", although he said he held particular scorn for those that were \"actively involved in the supply or technology chain of entire industries\".

The exercises are mostly taking place are in the north-west of the country, not close to Ukraines border. This is one in a string of announcements by Belarus since mid-October which Kyiv say is designed to stoke fear in Ukrainians and disinform Ukraines army. Spokespeople for Ukraines army said its chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, had a call with his Polish counterpart, Tomas Piotrowski, in which they discussed the announcement on Tuesday. Belarus borders Ukraine as well as Poland. In mid-October, Belarus announced a joint military taskforce with Russia to deal with what its president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, described as the Ukraine-Nato threat. Belarus and Russia have said they are creating joint military training centres in Belarus and Russia has been sending in troops and equipment. As it stands, Belarus has not sent forces into Ukraine but it allows Russia to regularly launch missiles from its territory into Ukraine and was one of the key launchpads for Russias February attack. Analysts say that a potential attack on Ukraine from the north would probably be aimed at cutting off or disrupting supplies coming in from Poland as well as stretching Ukrainian forces across the country. Ukraine has not ruled out the possibility of such an attack but Ukraines defence minister Oleksii Reznikov told Reuters in November that Ukraine is confident it can repel any attempt. On Tuesday, the spokesperson for Ukraines border service, Andriy Demchenko, said that they had not observed the type of offensive military formation on Ukraines border with Belarus that would indicate an attack is imminent.\n\nUpdated at 10.11 EST\n\n13 Dec 2022 09.18 EST Ukrainian officials gave the all clear on Tuesday after air raid sirens blared across the country following warnings that Russia may carry out a new wave of missile strikes. No new attacks were reported despite the air alerts, officials said. Russia has launched several waves of missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure since October that have caused power outages across the country. Ukrainian media said the alerts may have been triggered by MiG fighter jets that took off from Ryazan, near Russias border with Ukraine, and flew towards Belarus.\n\n13 Dec 2022 08.58 EST Paris aid conference raises 1bn for Ukraine, says France More than 1bn was raised to support Ukraine this winter at an aid conference in Paris, Frances foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, said. The money, pledged by 46 countries and 24 international organisations, would be split between restoring Ukraines depleted energy network, the food sector, water supply, health and transportation, Colonna said. She said these were \"new commitments, thanks to the holding of this conference. It is aid, or gifts in kind. It is not loans.\"\n\nUpdated at 09.03 EST\n\n13 Dec 2022 08.47 EST Earlier we reported that air sirens had been heard across Ukraine, including Kyiv, this afternoon. There have been no immediate reports of attacks, and Ukrainian media said the alerts may have been triggered by MiG fighter jets that took off from Ryazan, near Russias border with Ukraine, and flew towards Belarus.\n\n13 Dec 2022 08.19 EST Russia rejects Zelenskiys peace proposal, says Ukraine must accept new realities Ukraine must take into account the new territorial \"realities\" that include Russias annexation of four Ukrainian regions, the Kremlin has said in response to Volodymyr Zelenskiys three-step proposal for peace. In a statement to G7 countries yesterday, the Ukrainian leader said Russia could begin to withdraw its troops from the territory of Ukraine to show they are capable of abandoning their aggression. Zelenskiy told G7 leaders he was offering Moscow an \"opportunity to make a real, meaningful step towards diplomatic settlement\" of the conflict. He said: The holidays are ahead, celebrated by billions of people around the world: Christmas of the Gregorian calendar, New Year, Christmas of the Julian calendar. This is the time when normal people think about peace, not about aggression. I offer Russia the opportunity to at least try to demonstrate that they can abandon the way of aggression. It would be right to start withdrawing Russian troops from internationally recognised borders of Ukraine this Christmas. If Russia withdraws its troops from Ukraine, it will ensure a lasting cessation of hostilities. Russia does not have full control of any of the four provinces of Ukraine it says it annexed in September, but which most UN member countries have condemned as illegal. In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Ukraine needed to accept new territorial \"realities\", including that the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk provinces of Ukraine were Russias \"new subjects\". Asked about the proposed Russian troop withdrawal, Peskov said: The Ukrainian side needs to take into account the realities that have developed during this time. And these realities indicate that new subjects have appeared in the Russian Federation. They appeared as a result of referendums that took place in these territories. Without taking these new realities into account, no kind of progress is possible. There could be \"no question\" of Moscow beginning to pull out its troops by the end of the year, he said.\n\nUpdated at 09.05 EST",

                "cc_text": "Ukraines liberation of the city of Kherson at the beginning of November was more than just a dramatic military victory. In its battlefield win, Ukraine called Russian President Vladimir Putins bluff. Just two months earlier, Putin had publicly declared Kherson and other Ukrainian territories to be a part of Russia, implicitly placing them under Russias nuclear protection. Putin had hoped that the fear of nuclear attack would compel Ukraine to tread lightly and make its supporters back off. His plan did not work.\n\nKherson is unlikely to be the end of Ukraines successful counteroffensive. The greatest prize lies farther to the south: the Crimean Peninsula, where the war began in 2014. A Ukrainian deputy defense minister has declared that the countrys military could enter \"Crimea by the end of December.\" Such remarks may be subterfuge intended to frighten Russia. Or they may be serious. With the liberation of Kherson, Crimea has certainly fallen within Ukraines sights. Russia may well be dug in around Crimea, but if the war has demonstrated anything so far it is that Russia can lose territory, and lose it quickly. The battle of Crimea is certainly possible.\n\nUkraines international partners have committed themselves to defending its territorial integrity. They have an interest in containing Russias military power and in preventing a renewed invasion of Ukraine. If Crimea remains in Russian hands, it threatens Ukraines security. Russias invasion in 2022 was staged in part from Crimea. The Crimean peninsula is a dagger pointed not only toward the Black Sea but toward Kyiv. An annexed Crimea was not the limit of Russian imperial ambitions, as many Western leaders had hoped in 2014. Rather, it was the steppingstone for these ambitions.\n\nCrimea is not Kherson. It occupies a different place in the war, and many Western allies have serious escalation concerns over Crimea. Putin could lose in Kherson, or elsewhere in Ukraine, and accept his losses. He could even lose the Donbas, part of eastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied since 2014, and make do politically. But Putin surely regards losing Crimea and surviving as president as irreconcilable. He will go to great lengths to hold on to Crimea.\n\nThat could be a tall order. Ukraine has already demonstrated Crimeas vulnerability with attacks on Russias Black Sea Fleet and strikes on the bridge over the Kerch Strait, connecting Russia to Crimea. It should continue to pressure Crimea militarily and to advance in the southern Kherson region. Ideally, Kyiv would regain control over the freshwater canal that supplies Crimea with most of its water. At every moment, Ukraine should make Russia fear an invasion of Crimea.\n\nFor the time being, however, it is wise to pin and isolate Russian soldiers in Crimea without seeking to reconquer the peninsula. This strategy would give Kyiv a strong position in future negotiations with Russia, possibly convincing the Kremlin to enter such talks in earnest. It would help maintain unity among Ukraines Western partners worried about escalation risks. More immediately, Ukraine can try to break up the land bridge to Crimea, separating Russias forces in the south from its forces in the east and regaining access to the Sea of Azov. A costly and dangerous campaign to retake the peninsula now might put at risk the counteroffensive Ukraine has been so brilliantly waging since September.\n\nTHE DILEMMA OF CONQUEST\n\nCrimea is a hub of world history. During the reign of the Russian Empress Catherine the Great in the eighteenth century, her military won control of the peninsula from the Ottoman Empire, and it was incorporated into the Russian Empire. In the nineteenth century, the Ottomans allied with Britain and France to fight Russia in the Crimean War. In the twentieth century, it became Soviet after the Bolshevik Revolution and witnessed heavy fighting in World War II. Discussions between Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt were held in the Crimean city of Yalta, in 1945. In 1954 Crimea ceased to be a part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, when the Kremlin reassigned it to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nIn 2014, Russia annexed Crimea at gunpoint. Its conquest became the keystone of Putins political legacy, the marker of Russian intransigence vis--vis the West, and Putins evidence that Russias post-Soviet age of humiliation was over. The annexation of Crimea was popular in Russia. Outside Russia, Crimeas status is unambiguous: it is internationally recognized as Ukrainian territory. Ukraines sovereignty will be compromised until Russia withdraws from Crimea. Festering problems in Crimea will hurt Ukraines chances of joining Western institutions such as NATO and the European Union. Both organizations are hesitant to accept new members with unresolved territorial questions, which is one reason why Putin wants to hang on to Crimea in perpetuity. But none of this may prevent a battle for Crimea, a battle that Russia is hardly guaranteed to win. Should such a battle come to pass, three threats will emerge.\n\nThe most important is the prospect of nuclear escalation. Since the invasion in February 2022, Putin has had to reconfigure his war aims, contradicting himself along the way. The so-called special military operation to consolidate territory in the Donbas was actually a maximalist war against Ukraine. Putin has since ordered a mobilization, announced a war with the West, and tried to annex four southern regions in Ukraine, a theatrical gesture that cannot obscure the fact that Russia has surrendered much of the territory it took since February 24. A masterpiece of unrealism, Putins annexation was followed by implicit nuclear threats. Ukraine exposed these threats as empty by regaining large swaths of the recently annexed territory, to which Russia did not respond with nuclear escalation.\n\nWhat was a bluff in Kherson may not be a bluff in Crimea. Crimea has a particular standing in Russian history and culture for Putin and for many Russians. It figures in the World War II narrative that Putins Russia has fervently embraced. For generations of Russians, it has been a vacation idyll, analogous to Florida and California in the United States. The region also looms large in Russian literature, in particular in Tolstoys Sebastopol Sketches (1855) and Vasily Aksyonovs Island of Crimea (1981). Politically, Crimea was the region of Ukraine closest to Russia before 2014, and many of its 2.4 million inhabitants have pro-Russian views. Since 2014, Russia has persecuted pro-Ukrainian activists and Crimean Tatars, forcing many of them to leave Crimea.\n\nCrimea is more than just a symbol for Putins Russia.\n\nAnnexing Crimea is Putins signature achievement, meant to demonstrate Russias post-Soviet reassertion of power, the scope of its military might, and the luster of Putins strategic acumen. He bragged to the Russian people about outfoxing the West on Crimea. Having constructed this narrative, Putin would become the victim of it were Ukraine to retake Crimea. He would be the one outfoxed.\n\nCrimea is more than just a symbol for Putins Russia. It is of great strategic value to whichever country possesses it. It has enabled Russias naval blockade of Ukraine, a major economic pressure point in the war, and Crimea has been home to Russias Black Sea Fleet for over two centuries. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia and Ukraine created an arrangement whereby Russia leased the port of Sevastopol from Ukraine, an arrangement that lasted until the annexation in 2014. Consolidating Russian control over Sevastopolfor the sake of the fleetwas a key reason for Russias annexation of Crimea. Unlike Kherson, Crimea may be a genuine redline for Putin.\n\nSecond, even if Crimeas 10,000 square miles were easy to conquer, the region would not be easy for Kyiv to administer. The peninsula has been occupied since 2014. What effect this occupation has had is hard to judge. Living under Russian law, many of Crimeas residents are and consider themselves to be Russian citizens. Ukrainian soldiers might be treated as liberators, but they would not be universally welcomed by Crimeas population, which is larger than Latvias or Estonias. Kyiv would have to decide whether to put collaborators and political leaders on trial or to provide amnesty. Either option would be politically divisive. The complexities of restoring Crimea to Ukrainian rule during war could adversely affect Ukraines global image at a time when Ukraine relies on its positive reputation to win military and economic support.\n\nThe third threat is the potential fracturing of the alliance that supports Ukraine. Throughout the war, Ukraine and its Western partners have achieved a remarkable degree of cohesion, though there are of course differences. Ukraine is fighting for its survival and wants greater Western involvement in the war. The West is concerned about escalation with a nuclear armed Russia and has chosen not to involve its own troops.\n\nCrimea would be a major test for the coalition. Most central and eastern European allies would support Ukraine all the way. They are inclined to see Putins nuclear threats as fundamentally insincere. Other countries backing Ukraine have a different calculus and are more perturbed by escalation risks. These include France, Germany, and the United States. Brazil, China, India, and other countries in the global South are seeking a quick end to the war and to its many global ripple effects. They are agnostic about Crimea, unwilling to recognize it as part of Russia but eager for the whole problem to go away.\n\nA GRAND ALLIANCE\n\nSo far, the coalition supporting Ukraine has wisely steered clear of declaring specific war aims, giving Ukraine maximum room for maneuver. The G-7 released a communiqu in October calling for \"a just peace\" and Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. Left unsaid was whether this just peace was to be achieved by pushing Russia out of Ukraine (including Crimea) through military means or by negotiating a settlement that would involve compromises with Putin.\n\nIn theory, the quick takeover of Crimea could secure Ukraine against Russias future use of the peninsula as a staging ground, ending the war on Ukrainian terms. In practice, it would risk nuclear escalation, and it would be very costly to Ukraine while the war continues in other parts of the country, as stocks of ammunition available to Ukraine diminish and Russia mounts a vicious attack on its supplies of water and electricity.\n\nUkraine should keep Crimea vulnerable by continuing to attack military targets. It should push farther south in the Kherson region, demonstrating that Crimea and its water supply are within reach of the Ukrainian military. The threat of invasion should never be off the table. It gives Ukraine real power over Russia and leverage in potential talks. Given Putins fixation with Crimea, this may be the greatest power Ukraine has. Stopping short of retaking Crimea while pressuring it militarily might not forestall Putins use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, but it would lower the risk.\n\nIn the meantime, bolstering Ukraines antimissile and antidrone defenses and assisting its advance in the northeast and southeast are important short- and mid-term objectives. Ukraine should aim to break up the land bridge to Crimea that Moscow had long coveted and for which it has brutally fought. If Ukraines military succeeds, it can drive a wedge between Russias forces in the south and in the east by advancing to Melitopol and on to the Sea of Azov. Crumbling Russian control of these territories in the east and the south would add to the overall instability of the Russian armys position in Ukraine and to the unpopularity of the war in Russia.\n\nUkraine and its supporters should approach the question of Crimea with confidence. Russia has already dealt itself a strategic defeat with its decision to invade Ukraine last February. It has shown its military to be weaker than many had predicted before the war. It has been the author of its own diplomatic isolation, which it can reverse only by ending the war. It has hobbled its economy and slowed its military modernization by incurring sanctions. It has fostered a strong sense of national belonging in Ukraine, and it has dramatically strengthened the transatlantic alliance, of which Ukraine is now a de facto member. Over time, Russias built-in weaknesses and the Wests and Ukraines assets will have their effect. When they do, new options to address the question of Crimea will open up.",

Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nORHEI, Moldova Starved of natural gas from Russia and electricity from Ukraines missile-battered power grid, Moldova has been so unsettled by skyrocketing utility bills and occasional blackouts that, according to the mayor of a small city in the north, residents can barely contain their anger.\n\n\"They stop me on the street and ask: When can we go to another protest?\" said the mayor, Pavel Verejanu, of Orhei, describing what he called public fury at the pro-Western central government and its failure to secure a deal with Russia for a steady supply of cheap energy.\n\nBut there is another reason people are so eager to protest: They are paid to join the noisy weekly rallies that have been held since September in the capital, Chisinau, calling for the removal of Moldovas president, Maia Sandu, a former World Bank official pushing Europes poorest country out of Moscows orbit.\n\nThe paid protests against the president and her westward tilt are organized by the mayors political party, a vociferously pro-Russian force led by his predecessor, Ilan M. Shor, a convicted fraudster and fugitive who, officials say, is working to turn an energy crisis into a political crisis that threatens the government.\n\nAnger at high energy prices has been bubbling across Europe for months, offering Moscow what it sees as its best hope of eroding public support for Ukraine and pressuring Western governments to back away from their condemnations of Russias invasion.\n\nRussia-friendly activists on the far left and far right have helped mobilize protests over high energy prices in the Czech Republic, Germany and other European countries. But those demonstrations have been less frequent and far less well-funded than the weekly rallies and often daily flash mob protests in Moldova, a country that is particularly vulnerable because of its longstanding political, economic and linguistic cleavages.\n\nImage An antigovernment demonstration in Chisinau in November, by people who are angry at high energy prices and blame the government. Credit... Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nRussia has not only created public discontent in Moldova through a squeeze on energy supplies, but, working through local allies like Mr. Shor, has also pushed this discontent onto the streets, trying to unseat the pro-Western government.\n\n\"It is obvious these things are all connected,\" said Moldovas foreign minister, Nicu Popescu. The energy crisis, he added in an interview, is \"very, very serious,\" and \"it is legitimate for a lot of people to feel unhappy.\"\n\nBut he scorned Mr. Shors role in organizing and bankrolling protests as \"an attempt to manipulate and ride the negative effects of the war in Ukraine.\" The result, he said: An energy crunch engineered by Russia and exploited by groups that \"openly support Russia\" to \"destabilize the government.\"\n\nA tiny but strategically important country sandwiched between Romania a member of NATO and the European Union and Ukraine, Moldova has been caught since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, of which it was a part, in an intense geopolitical tug of war between East and West.\n\nLocal politicians backed by either Moscow or Washington and the European Union have traded power in a long series of unstable governments in Chisinau. Mr. Shors party won just six of 101 seats in Parliament in elections last year, while Ms. Sandus party won a big majority over those seeking close relations with Moscow.\n\nImage Elena Lungu lighting a wood-burning stove this month in a village outside Orhei, Moldova. Her family now uses it for heating because it cannot afford to use its gas-fired boiler. Credit... Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nRussias February invasion of neighboring Ukraine pushed this perennial struggle into a tumultuous new phase.\n\nIt sent shock waves and, on at least two occasions, missiles crashing onto Moldovan territory. The missiles, the second of which was found on Monday, landed in northern Moldova near the border with Ukraine, further rattling a fragile country already grappling with inflation of nearly 35 percent. Gas prices in Moldova have increased sevenfold and electricity prices have increased fourfold in the past 12 months, Ms. Sandu, the countrys president, told CNN on Saturday.\n\nThough not a direct party to the war, Moldova, whose Constitution commits it to neutrality, has felt Russias fury through sharp cuts in energy supplies.\n\n\"Russias objective is clear,\" said Andrei Spinu, a deputy prime minister in charge of Moldovas frantic efforts to patch together alternative supplies of electricity and gas. \"They want to change our government, and change our geopolitical choice toward Europe,\" he said, sitting in a gloomy office in central Chisinau lit only by thin winter light coming through the windows.\n\nAll the lights in his office have been turned off to save electricity. He uses a cellphone flashlight to navigate the darkened corridors of the main government building. Russian missile strikes on Ukraines power grid, which used to provide Moldova with a vital backup source of electricity, left the whole country without power late last month.\n\nImage Gas pipes in Curchi, in Orhei County. Electricity and gas prices have more than doubled in Moldova. Credit... Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nThe wide boulevard outside his office has been a frequent site of the protests organized by the Shor Party. Its leader, Mr. Shor, directs them from his refuge in Israel. He finances the demonstrations and speaks by video link to each gathering chanting for Ms. Sandus removal.\n\nWarning of a \"tough winter\" ahead without Russian gas, Mr. Shor recently used his Facebook page to call on supporters to \"come out en masse\" for street protests. \"We must do everything we can to get rid of this incompetent government and hold early elections.\"\n\nHe did not respond to requests for an interview through his spokesperson.\n\nIn October, the United States imposed sanctions on Mr. Shor, his Russian pop-star wife and seven others for involvement in \"persistent malign influence campaigns\" by Russia in Moldova.\n\nThat same month, the police conducted nighttime raids on 55 offices, vehicles and residences connected to him and his party. Investigators seized 20 black plastic shopping bags stuffed with local currency worth $89,000, which prosecutors say represented a weeks outlay on protests and other activities aimed at unseating the government.\n\n\"A lot of effort and money has been put into destabilizing the situation in our country,\" Veronica Dragalin, Moldovas anticorruption prosecutor, said in an interview.\n\nMany people, including American officials, suspect that some of the Shor Partys cash comes from Russia, which would be illegal, but Mr. Shor has denied it. He has also appealed his 2017 conviction and seven-and a-half-year sentence over his role in the theft of nearly a billion dollars from Moldovan banks, insisting he is the victim of a corrupt justice system.\n\nImage \"A lot of effort and money has been put into destabilizing the situation in our country,\" said Veronica Dragalin, Moldovas anticorruption prosecutor. Credit... Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nPaying people to protest is not illegal. But by amplifying genuine discontent it creates an impression that the country is falling apart a message, analysts say, that has been promoted with glee by Russian news outlets.\n\nMr. Shors party also routinely exaggerates the size of its protests, claiming, for example, that 45,000 showed up last week outside the prosecutor generals office. The real number was a few thousand.\n\nThe spectacle of a political partys echoing Kremlin talking points on the war and organizing paid protests over an energy crisis generated by Russia illustrates one of Moscows favorite tactics for asserting its influence across the former Soviet Union: Stoke a crisis and then, either directly or through local proxies, offer a solution that requires acceptance of Russian hegemony.\n\nThe pattern first played out three decades ago when, just months after the collapse of the Soviet Union, ethnic Russian separatists in the Transnistria region of eastern Moldova took up arms against the government of the newly independent nation. Moscow vowed to quell the violence and sent in troops, allowing Transnistria to operate ever since as a quasi-state haven for Russian influence and black market trade.\n\nImage Soldiers in Tiraspol, Transnistria, in May. Russias military presence in Transnistria, a territory that broke away from Moldova in 1992, consists primarily of ill-trained local recruits. Credit... Cristian Movila for The New York Times\n\nThe pattern repeated in 2014 in eastern Ukraine, where Russia stoked an armed rebellion against the central government in Kyiv, and then offered to help curb the mayhem provided that Ukraine accept terms entrenching Moscows influence. After that failed, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered a full-scale invasion in February.\n\nWith Russian troops flailing in Ukraine, nobody expects the Kremlin to send its battered military into Moldova any time soon. A small Russian force remains in Transnistria, but most of the troops are ill-trained local recruits, and they are sorely underequipped. Ukraine closed its borders with Transnistria at the start of the war, severing supply lines.\n\nIts military options limited, Moscow has instead hammered Moldova with its energy weapon, delivering less than half the natural gas stipulated in contracts.\n\nMany supporters of Mr. Shor, the fugitive millionaire, in Orhei, where he served as mayor for four years before fleeing to Israel in 2019, acknowledge that he may be a crook.\n\nBut pointing to his tenure as mayor, when he built sidewalks, installed lights and improved Orhei markedly, they see him as a Robin Hood figure whose wealth, no matter its source, will bring benefits to ordinary people.\n\nImage A Christmas tree in early December in the center of Orhei, where many supporters of the fugitive politician Ilan M. Shor acknowledge that he may be corrupt, but point to improvements he made as mayor. Credit... Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nHis other big selling point is that, unlike the current government, he has close ties with Russia and can use them to end the energy crunch.\n\nIndeed, soon after Russias energy behemoth, Gazprom, began cutting gas deliveries to Moldova in the fall, a move that threatened a long, cold winter ahead, Mr. Shor criticized Ms. Sandu for \"bowing to the West.\" And he sent several of his partys legislators to Moscow to find \"solutions to provide the Republic of Moldova with natural gas this winter at affordable prices,\" the party said in a statement.\n\nMr. Shor claimed that Russia would soon start providing cheap gas to the region around Orhei. That never happened, not least because delivering Russian gas only to Orhei is technically and legally impossible.\n\nThousands of protesters have, nonetheless, gathered every week since in support of his appeal for better relations with Russia.\n\nImage Pavel Verejanu, the current mayor of Orhei, acknowledges that some antigovernment protesters are paid. Credit... Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times\n\nMr. Shor recently acknowledged paying protesters after an independent Moldovan newspaper, Ziarul de Garda, published an investigation written by journalists who had posed as protesters and received money.\n\nMr. Verejanu, the mayor of Orhei, said no more than half the protesters were paid, and only those too poor to buy food and drink during the trip to and from Chisinau.\n\nAt a Shor Party rally last week outside the prosecutor generals office, protesters blocked the main boulevard and denounced the president and government ministers as corrupt thieves blind to peoples economic pain.\n\nMaria Muntiu, 80, insisted she had not been paid to attend and had come out because she wanted to express her anger at being unable to afford heating.\n\nMoldova, she said, needs a \"real president like Putin\" who will put the countrys interests ahead of \"geopolitical games by America\" and provide cheap energy. Ms. Sandu, she said, \"is trying to freeze us into silence.\"",

Serhiy Haidai, the exiled governor of the Luhansk region, told Ukrainian television that a strike in the town of Kadiivka had led to a \"huge number\" of deaths among the mercenary group that has been accused of torture and other war crimes. \"They had a little pop there, just where Wagner headquarters was located,\" Haidai said, according to a Reuters translation of his remarks. \"A huge number of those who were there have died,\" he said. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify that Wagner was headquartered at the site of the attack or that the strike led to a large number of casualties. But there are a number of indications that the mercenary group was hit. Russian state media have confirmed that a hotel complex in the town of Kadiivka, which Russians called Stakhanov, was hit by artillery fire on Sunday. Photographs and video posted to social media showed that the Zhdanov guest house in the town had largely been reduced to rubble. The first photos from the scene were published by a pro-war Russian military blogger who has previously reported on Wagner and posted photos of the groups fighters. \"The strike was done by Himars,\" wrote Alexander Simonov, the blogger who runs the Brussels Messenger channel on Telegram. \"There were members of the Wagner PMC in the building.\" That complex had previously been rumoured to house Russian officers fighting in the region. It is not clear how many people were injured in the strike. Video uploaded from the scene showed that at least several men had been injured inside the building and were awaiting medical help. And in another video, a number of men in camouflage stand around a rocket tail recovered from the site and discuss the attack, indicating that the strike was aimed at those fighting for Russia. In another twist, an old photo at the hotel may show the son of Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin in full camouflage holding a rifle. Pavel Prigozhin has previously been reported to be fighting for Wagner. I did a mini-thread-within-a-thread here about a new data point in Ukraine's HIMARS attack on a reported Wagner base in Kadiivka - Pavel Prigozhin (Yevgeny's son) was reportedly photographed at the site. I haven't seen any news about him still being there when the attack happened https://t.co/on1stIL0Cw Aric Toler (@AricToler) December 12, 2022 In a statement, Prigozhin denied that his son had been injured in the strike. \"Dont worry. Everything is fine with my son,\" he said in a remark carried on a Telegram channel associated with the Wagner founder. Prigozhin did not say whether or not the mercenary group had been headquartered at the site.\n\nUpdated at 06.08 EST\n\n12 Dec 2022 13.43 EST Zelenskiy urges G7 to supply Ukraine with natural gas, long-range weapons Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has appealed to the G7 nations to help obtain an additional two billion cubic metres of natural gas and to supply it with modern tanks, artillery units and shells as well as long-range weapons. In a video address to the Group of Seven nations, Zelenskiy also called on Russia to make a \"substantive\" step towards a diplomatic resolution of the war in Ukraine. He said: If Russia conducts a withdrawal of its forces from Ukraine, then it will also ensure a reliable end of hostilities. I see no reason why Russia should not do this now - in time for Christmas.\n\n12 Dec 2022 12.57 EST Unliveable winter to force hundreds of thousands more refugees from Ukraine to Europe The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council has said he expects another wave of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine to go to Europe over the winter because of \"unliveable\" conditions. Millions of people in Ukraine have been left without heat, clean water or power amid plummeting temperatures, following Russian missile strikes on the countrys energy infrastructure. Speaking to Reuters, Jan Egeland said: Nobody knows how many, but there will be hundreds of thousands more (leaving Ukraine) as the horrific and unlawful bombing of civilian infrastructure makes life unliveable in too many places. He said he was concerned the crisis in Europe would \"deepen and that will overshadow equality crises in other places of the world\". Around 18 million people, or 40% of the countrys population, is depending on aid, according to the UN. Another 7.8 million have left Ukraine for other parts of Europe.\n\nUpdated at 05.26 EST\n\n12 Dec 2022 12.36 EST EU countries have not yet agreed on a ninth package of sanctions on Russia, the blocs foreign chief, Josep Borrell, said. Speaking after a meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels, Borrell said: An agreement was not been reached by the ministers but I hope it will be agreed this week.\n\n12 Dec 2022 11.55 EST The exiled mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, said occupying Russian troops in the southern Ukrainian city are \"redeploying\" and are \"panicking\" following Ukrainian attacks on the Russian-occupied city over the weekend. Russian forces \"are busy moving their military groups to other places to try to hide them\", Fedorov said, without proving any evidence.\n\n12 Dec 2022 11.41 EST Ukraines first lady, Olena Zelenska, has met with her French counterpart, Brigitte Macron, during her visit to France. In a statement on Telegram, Zelenska described Emmanuel Macrons wife as \"a great friend of Ukraine\" and thanked France for their support and aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russias invasion. She said: I think that the French, who have always valued human rights (and the most indisputable of them the right to life), will not stay aside here either. After all, human rights have no borders. My visit to France began with a meeting with First Lady Brigitte Macron not only my colleague, but a real friend of mine and of all . Thanked for her contribution in supporting our peoples fight, and sincere care and attention to Ukrainians who escaped to because of war. pic.twitter.com/2xh105gc2P (@ZelenskaUA) December 12, 2022\n\n12 Dec 2022 11.07 EST EU agrees on extra 2bn for military support for Ukraine Jennifer Rankin The EU has agreed an extra 2bn for a fund that has been used to supply Ukraine with weapons. EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday signed off the money for the \"European Peace Facility\", a fund that has been largely used to reimburse member states for supplying Ukraine with weapons and non-lethal military kit. \"This decision sends a clear political signal of the EUs enduring commitment to military support for Ukraine and other partners alike,\" the EU Council of Ministers said in a statement. The 5bn fund was established last year with the aim of boosting security, but was rapidly becoming depleted following successive donations to Ukraine, raising concerns about whether the EU could maintain the flow of weapons and assist other states. The 2bn top up was approved on Monday, despite concerns about Hungarys \"blackmail diplomacy\", after Budapest blocked an 18bn financial aid package for Ukraine last week. Hungary has previously signed off on the EU weapons fund for Ukraine, although it does not allow arms to pass through its territory. Commenting on Budapests position on Ukraine, one senior diplomat said: Its a type of blackmail diplomacy that we would rather not see, but it is what it is, so we will have to deal with it. Separately EU ministers also issued a statement condemning Iran for supplying Russia with weapons that have been used \"indiscriminately by Russia\" against Ukraines civilian population. It also warned Iran against any new deliveries of weapons to Russia including short-range ballistic missiles, which it said would \"constitute a serious escalation\". The EU is discussing its ninth round of sanctions against Russia, which include bans on the sale of drones and parts. Officials are concerned that Iranian weapons used in Ukraine, including drones, are being manufactured in Europe.\n\n12 Dec 2022 10.52 EST UK open minded about sending longer-range weapons to Ukraine Britains defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he would be \"open minded\" about supplying Ukraine with longer-range weapons systems if Russia continued to target civilian areas. Asked in parliament by the former prime minister, Boris Johnson, about the possible supply of longer-range missile systems to Kyiv to destroy or damage drone launch sites, Wallace replied: I constantly review the weapons systems we could provide. We too have in our armour potential weapons systems that are longer and should the Russians continue to target civilian areas and try and break those Geneva conventions, then I will be open minded to see what we do next.\n\n12 Dec 2022 10.40 EST Russia has missiles for another three to five waves of strikes on Ukraine, says Ukrainian general Ukraines deputy head of military intelligence has claimed that Russia is using old Ukrainian missiles against Kyiv, and warned that Moscows forces have enough missiles to launch another three to five waves of strikes on the country. The missiles, built in a Ukrainian weapons factory and handed over to Russia in the 1990s under an agreement aimed at assuring Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity, have shown up in the rubble of the large wave of Russian strikes across Ukraine in October, according to Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraines military intelligence. While Russias stockpiles of modern, precision missiles are believed to be running low, he said Russian arms factories had been able to build 240 precision Kh-101 cruise missiles and about 120 of the sea-based Kalibr cruise missiles since the start of the war. This would work out to be about 40 new missiles since the start of the war. In an interview with the New York Times, Skibitsky offered a detailed assessment of current Russian capabilities and Ukraines ability to counter the threat. He said: According to our calculations, they have missiles for another three to five waves of attacks. This is if there are 80 to 90 rockets in one wave. He also outlined the four general directions from which Russia is launching missiles into Ukraine - from the Black Sea in the south, from the area around the Caspian Sea to the southeast, from Russia in the east and from Belarus to the north.\n\n12 Dec 2022 09.31 EST Two civilians killed and 10 injured after Russian rocket attack in Donetsk region Two civilians have been killed and 10 more injured after Russian rocket attacks on the town of Hirnyk in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. The prosecutor generals office said via Telegram: \"According to the investigation data, on the morning of 12 December, the troops of the Russian Federation struck the town of Hirnyk, Kurakhove community, with cluster munitions and Uragan MLRS [multilaunch rocket systems]. \"The shells hit the central part of the town. As a result of the shelling, two citizens were killed and ten more received injuries of varying degrees of severity. The injured were evacuated to the hospital in Selydove town, they are given qualified medical care.\" Hirnyk is a small city in the oblast to the east of Ukraine, with a population of about 10,000, according to a report published in early 2022. Reports have said that paramedics are at the scene and an investigation has been opened into potential war crimes.\n\nUpdated at 10.29 EST\n\n12 Dec 2022 09.26 EST Germany has said Hungary should support the joint loan to Ukraine and global minimum corporate tax because of the importance of the EUs \"democratic values\". Talks between ambassadors from the EUs 27 member states will resume at 5pm as Hungary continues to veto the 18bn (15.5bn) joint loan to Ukraine. The EU has withheld 5.8bn from Hungary over \"poor judicial independence\", Reuters reports, and another 7.5bn over corruption. Other states have claimed the government in Budapest is trying to \"blackmail\" the bloc over the funds. Hungary says it opposes joint EU borrowing to support Ukraine but that it would extend bilateral aid to Kyiv instead, and added that the OECD plan is against Hungarys national interests. EU rules say 70% of 5.8bn would be lost unless the bloc approves by the end of the year handing it over to Budapest. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said: \"The rule of law is the backbone of the European Union. \"This is why Germany supports the excellent proposals by the European Commission to make clear that this is about our values, about the rule of law in the entire European Union.\"\n\nUpdated at 10.17 EST\n\n12 Dec 2022 08.47 EST Poland and Germany should ask the EU for more help in dealing with an expected increase in Ukrainian refugees during the winter, the Polish president has said. Millions have already fled Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February. There are fears more could leave their homes during colder months as Russia continues to attack key infrastructure. \"I believe that we should turn to the European community so that there is financial support for our countries, which bear a particular burden in connection with taking in refugees from Ukraine,\" Andrzej Duda said during a press conference in Berlin on Monday, Reuters reports.\n\nUpdated at 08.57 EST\n\n12 Dec 2022 08.25 EST Ukraines prime minister is the latest politician to repeat a plea for Patriot missile batteries and other hi-tech air defence systems to stop Russian rockets and air attacks, after more shelling was reported on Monday. Denys Shmyhal told the French broadcaster LCI that Russia could cause a new wave of refugees by continuing to target crucial infrastructure like energy and water during the winter. If the defence systems were supplied, it would represent another chapter in the war and a sign of further support for Ukraine, as no country has yet supplied them, Reuters reports. Ukraine needs large quantities of shells to respond like-for-like against Russian artillery, Shmyhal said. Russia fires 50,000 to 70,000 shells a day at Ukrainian targets, and \"we need at least one-third of that quantity every day\", he added.\n\nUpdated at 09.00 EST\n\n12 Dec 2022 07.51 EST EU could face gas shortage next year The EU has secured enough gas for this winter but could face a gas shortage next year if Russia further cuts supplies, the European Commission and the International Energy Agency (IEA) have warned. If Russia cuts the small share of gas it still delivers to Europe, after slashing gas deliveries this year, and Chinas gas demand rebounds from lockdown-induced lows, the EU could face a gas shortfall of 27bn cubic metres (bcm) in 2023, the IEA said. Total EU gas consumption was 412 bcm in 2021, according to EU data. Speaking at a press conference, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the blocs gas supply was \"safe for this winter\" and the EU was preparing for the next one. We have worked hard to be safe for this winter.\n\nWe are now turning our focus to preparing 2023, and the next winter.@fbirol from the @IAE and I have discussed the energy outlook and how to avoid gas shortages in 2023\n\nhttps://t.co/oGR2ey6Tgo Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) December 12, 2022 The energy watchdog said the potential shortage could be averted by expanding subsidies and policies to save energy by renovating draughty homes and replacing fossil fuel-based heating with heat pumps. It has also called for better campaigns to encourage consumers to use less energy.\n\nUpdated at 09.01 EST",

Kyiv says peace talks are only possible if Russia stops attacking and withdraws.\n\nRussia has previously said it is open to peace talks. Ukraine and allies fear any ceasefire without a total withdrawal would allow Russian forces to regroup in preparation for further attacks.\n\nMr. Peskov said Russia will not pull out of Ukraine.\n\nHe added that the search for ways to end the war was hindered by the U.S. refusal to recognize territory in Ukraine that Russia has annexed. Mr. Putin has proclaimed the southern region of Kherson and three other partly occupied regions of Ukraine to be part of Russia, in a move condemned as illegal by most countries.\n\nMr. Biden has not spoken directly with Mr. Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. In March, he branded Mr. Putin a \"butcher\" who \"cannot stay in power\". However, he has signalled in recent weeks that Washington would like to entice Mr. Putin onto a diplomatic off ramp, after months of battlefield losses and stalled gains for Moscow.\n\nDespite more than nine months of war, some contacts have been sustained between the sides, often through third parties including Turkey and Saudi Arabia. A deal that partially lifted a Russian naval blockade of Black Sea ports has allowed some grains shipments out of Ukraine, and another agreement on Russian fertilizers is in the works. Several large prisoner-of-war swaps have occurred.\n\nBut the fighting that has killed tens of thousands of people is unabated.\n\nWith winter tightening its grip, Western countries are trying to boost aid to help Ukraine withstand Russian missile and drone attacks on energy infrastructure that have left millions without heat, electricity and water.\n\nUkraine has driven Russian troops from swathes of occupied territory in recent weeks, including areas Russia claims to have annexed.\n\nIn the east, the town of Bakhmut is now the main target of Moscows artillery attacks, while Russian forces in Kherson and the Zaporizhzhia region remain on the defensive, Ukraines General Staff said in its latest battlefield update.\n\nIn a bid to reduce the money available for Moscows war effort, the European Union has tentatively agreed to a US$60-a-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil, diplomats said. The measure will need to be approved formally by all EU governments over the weekend.\n\nThe chair of the Russian lower houses foreign affairs committee, Leonid Slutsky, told Tass news agency the EU was jeopardizing its own energy security with the cap, and violating the laws of the market.\n\nMr. Putin told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a phone call that the Western line on Ukraine was \"destructive\" and urged Berlin to rethink its approach, the Kremlin said.\n\nIn Berlins readout on the call, Mr. Scholzs spokesperson said the chancellor had condemned Russian air strikes on civilian infrastructure and called for a diplomatic solution to the war \"including a withdrawal of Russian troops\".\n\nMr. Putin has said he has no regrets about launching what he calls a \"special military operation\" to disarm and \"denazify\" Ukraine. He casts the war as a watershed moment when Russia finally stood up to an arrogant West after decades of humiliation following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nUkraine and the West say Mr. Putin has no justification for what they cast as an imperial-style war of occupation.\n\nUkrainians countryside getaways have become off-grid safe havens from Russian attacks\n\nThree people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the Kherson region over the past 24 hours, the regional governor said on Friday.\n\nThe regional capital of Kherson recaptured by Ukrainian forces in mid-November and other parts of the region were bombarded 42 times in the same period, Governor Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian-installed officials in Donetsk said three people died on Friday after Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern Ukrainian city.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm battlefield reports.\n\nAttacks on infrastructure are likely to increase the cost to keep Ukraines economy going next year by up to US$1-billion a month, and aid to the country would need to be \"front-loaded\", IMF head Kristalina Georgieva told the Reuters NEXT conference on Thursday.\n\nUkraine and the West say the strategy of knocking out power and heat deliberately intends to harm civilians, a war crime, something Moscow denies.\n\nWhen Russian missiles began raining down on Liliia Khrystenkos neighbourhood in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, her parents were sitting on a bench outside their apartment block and chatting to friends. Lauren Anthony reports. Reuters\n\nIn a grisly development, several Ukrainian embassies abroad received \"bloody packages\" containing animal eyes, Ukraines foreign ministry said on Friday, after a series of letter bombs were sent to sites in Spain including Kyivs embassy in Madrid.\n\nThe packages, soaked in a liquid with a distinctive colour and smell, were sent to embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia and Italy, to general consulates in Naples and Krakow, and the consulate in Brno, spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said.\n\n\"We are studying the meaning of this message,\" Mr. Nikolenko wrote in a statement on Facebook, adding that Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has ordered all the embassies and consulates concerned to be placed under heightened security.",

According to witnesses, 10 explosions were heard, although some of those may have been from Russian anti-aircraft systems. Ukrainian officials claimed scores of Russian dead and injured while Russia conceded a handful of casualties. Video footage posted on social media showed what was claimed to be a Russian barracks in the southern city engulfed in a fierce blaze with some claiming the site was being used by the Wagner mercenary group. Another video showed rescue workers in the ruins with several bodies visible. The site, a former resort and hotel complex next to a church in the city known as the Hunters Halt, was being used as a barracks with most of the casualties apparently in a mess hall when it was hit. The strike on Melitopol reportedly with Himars rockets was one of several overnight on Russian bases. Explosions were also reported overnight in the Russian occupied Crimea, including Sevastopol and Simferopol.\n\n11 Dec 2022 13.14 EST A summary of today's developments An international team of legal advisers has been working with local prosecutors in Ukraines recaptured city of Kherson in recent days as they began gathering evidence of alleged sexual crimes by Russian forces as part of a full-scale investigation, Reuters reports. The visit was by a team from Global Rights Compliance, an international legal practice headquartered in The Hague.

He referred to claims of rape and sexual violence being used as weapons while he was in Kyiv, and that he also heard \"very credible claims\" that Ukrainian children are being forcibly sent to Russia to be adopted.\n\nRussias ex-president Dmitry Medvedev has said the country is ramping up production of new-generation weapons to protect itself from enemies in Europe, the United States and Australia, Reuters reports.\n\nA neo-Nazi paramilitary group linked to the Kremlin has asked its members to submit intelligence on border and military activity in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, raising concerns over whether far-right Russian groups are planning an attack on Nato countries. The official Telegram channel for \"Task Force Rusich\" currently fighting in Ukraine on behalf of the Kremlin and linked to the notorious Wagner Group last week requested members to forward details relating to border posts and military movements in the three Baltic states, which were formerly part of the Soviet Union.\n\nUkraine has attacked a barracks in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, with some Ukrainian sources claiming scores of Russian casualties. According to witnesses, 10 explosions were heard, although some of those may have been from Russian anti-aircraft systems. Ukrainian officials claimed scores of Russian dead and injured while Russia conceded a handful of casualties.\n\nThe German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said Vladimir Putin is determined to conquer parts of Ukraine and shows no restraint in his brutality. \"Whenever I speak with Putin, he says very clearly that for him it is about conquering something,\" Scholz said on Saturday at an event in Potsdam, near Berlin. \"He simply wants to conquer part of Ukrainian territory with violence.\"\n\n11 Dec 2022 12.32 EST The Ukrainian port of Odesa was not operating on Sunday after the latest Russian attack on the regions energy system, agriculture minister Mykola Solsky said, but added that grains traders were not expected to suspend exports.

The visit was by a team from Global Rights Compliance, an international legal practice headquartered in The Hague. Their efforts are part of a broader international effort to support overwhelmed Ukrainian authorities as they seek to hold Russians accountable for crimes they allegedly committed during the conflict. Accusations surfaced soon after Russias Feb. 24 invasion of rape and other abuses across the country, according to accounts Reuters gathered and the U.N. investigative body. Moscow, which says it is conducting a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, has denied committing war crimes or targeting civilians, and the Kremlin denies allegations of sexual violence by the Russian military in Ukraine. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Dec. 9 that a UN Human Rights report about Russian attacks on civilians was based on \"rumours and gossip\", and Moscow has accused Ukrainian forces of brutal reprisals against civilians who cooperated with Russian forces. \"Weve come down here for a three-day mission to support the Office of the Prosecutor General (OPG), and specifically the team investigating conflict-related sexual violence,\" said Julian Elderfield, one of the legal advisers who took part in the Kherson visit that ran from Thursday to Saturday. \"(Its about) asking the right questions, pursuing unique or different lines of investigation that might otherwise not have been pursued by local investigators,\" he told Reuters in Kherson.\n\n11 Dec 2022 11.08 EST Municipal workers prepare plywood for for boarding up broken windows after shelling in downtown Donetsk, Ukraine.

(Photo by Contributor/Getty Images) Photograph: Contributor/8523328/Getty Images Reuters reports on influential nationalist Russian blogger Igor Girkin who is reported to have visited the conflict zone. He is quoted as saying some Russian officers fighting in Ukraine are unhappy with the military top brass and Putin because of the poor execution of the war. The nationalist and former Federal Security Service (FSB) officer who helped Russia annex Crimea in 2014 and organised pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine, made his comments in a scathing 90-minute video. In it Girkin said the \"fishs head is completely rotten\" and the Russian military needed reform and to recruit competent people who could lead a successful military campaign. Some at the mid-levels of the military, Girkin said, were open about their dissatisfaction with defence minister Sergei Shoigu and even Putin. Girkin said: It is not just me... people are not blind and deaf at all: people at the mid-level there do not even hide their views which, how do I put it, are not fully complimentary about the president or the defence minister.\" Russias defence ministry did not comment on the remarks from Girkin who has repeatedly criticised Shoigu, a close Putin ally, for the battlefield defeats Russia has suffered in the war. The West, Girkin said, wanted to foment a revolutionary situation in Russia akin to the February Revolution in 1917. Russia, he said, had a lack of effective tactical missiles and it was unclear if it could produce enough while Russia had failed to establish air superiority due to Ukrainian air defences. \"Our Ministry of Defence has simply slept through the fact that the whole world has moved to new tactical aviation,\" he said. Girkin was convicted in absentia by Dutch judges for murder over his role in the shooting down of Flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014 with the loss of 298 passengers and crew. Russia, which has repeatedly denied downing the jet, rejected the verdict. Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, Russia passed laws which allow prison terms of up to five years for actions interpreted as discrediting the armed forces, or up to 15 years for disseminating deliberately false information.\n\n11 Dec 2022 10.08 EST Here is some footage of the aftermath of the strike earlier on barracks in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol (see 7.47 am) 00:00:47 Footage shows aftermath of strike on barracks in Russian-occupied city of Melitopol video\n\n11 Dec 2022 10.00 EST Europe is simply switching from dependency on Russian gas to dependency on liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States, the RIA news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying.

Photograph: Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters Peskov called the European desire to shake off dependency on Russian gas \"absurd\" and \"frenzied\", Reuters reports. \"They have changed dependency on Russia to dependency on American liquefied natural gas,\" RIA quoted Peskov as saying on state television, noting that the dependence was the same, just with \"much less reciprocity. \"And now, when the Europeans are losing billions of euros every day, Washington is already earning these billions of dollars,\" Peskov said.\n\n11 Dec 2022 08.57 EST More on the phone call between Putin and Erdoan. Reuters reports that the pair discussed their two countries joint energy projects, especially in the gas sector, Russian news agencies cited the Kremlin as saying. Two leaders exchanged opinions on the creation of a regional gas hub in Turkey, it added. The Turkish presidency said on Sunday: President Erdoan expressed his sincere wish for the termination of the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible.\" In the call, Erdoan and Putin also discussed grain supplies. Erdoans office said Ankara and Moscow could start work on exporting other food products and commodities through the Black Sea grain corridor. Russia has urged the United Nations to push the West to lift some sanctions to ensure Moscow can freely export its fertiliser and agricultural products - a part of the Black Sea grain deal that Moscow says has not been implemented. The Kremlin said in a statement: The deal is of complex character, which requires the removal of obstacles for the relevant supplies from Russia in order to meet the demands of the countries most in need.\" The Kremlin said the two also discussed an initiative to create a base in Turkey for exports of Russian natural gas: The special importance of joint energy projects, primarily in the gas industry, was emphasised.\" Gazprom chief Alexei Miller has held talks with Erdoan in Istanbul in the past week.\n\n11 Dec 2022 08.34 EST Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoan earlier this month. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoan called for a 30-kilometre (19-mile) security corridor on Turkeys border with Syria in a phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Erdogans office said Sunday. Referring to Kurdish militants that Ankara considers terrorists, Erdoan reiterated the \"importance and urgency\" of creating the corridor in northern Syria in accordance with a 2019 agreement between Turkey and Russia, the Associated Press reports. The call came three weeks after Turkey launched air and artillery strikes in Syria and Iraq in response to a bomb attack in Istanbul on 13 November that killed six people and wounded dozens. The Turkish government has blamed the bombing on the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, and its Syrian affiliate the Peoples Protection Units, or YPG. Both groups have denied involvement in the attack.\n\nUpdated at 08.40 EST\n\n11 Dec 2022 07.26 EST It is just gone 2.20pm in Ukraine and here is a summary of events so far: Two people were killed and another five wounded after Russian troops shelled the southern region of Kherson , the governor Yaroslav Yanushevich said, adding that Russian forces hit a maternity ward, a cafe and an apartment building on Saturday.\n\nUkraine has attacked the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol , with pro-Moscow authorities saying a missile attack killed two people and wounded 10, while the exiled mayor said scores of \"invaders\" were killed.\n\nThe UKs foreign secretary James Cleverly has said that there needed to be \"accountability\" for Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine .\n\nA neo-Nazi paramilitary group linked to the Kremlin has asked its members to submit intelligence on border and military activity in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, raising concerns over whether far-right Russian groups are planning an attack on Nato countries.\n\nRussia is ramping up production of most powerful weapons, says Russias ex-president Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nThe UKs foreign secretary James Cleverly has said he has not seen anything coming from Russia to suggest Putin is keen to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe German chancellor, Olaf Scholz , has said Vladimir Putin is determined to conquer parts of Ukraine and shows no restraint in his brutality.\n\nThe UKs Ministry of Defence says Russia s Federal Draft Budget, signed by Vladimir Putin in 2022, stating that more than 9 trillion rubles (US $143bn) will be allocated across \"defence, security and law enforcement\" in 2023 is likely to be \"over-optimistic\".\n\nRussian forces have \"destroyed\" the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, the countrys president , Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said\n\nJens Stoltenberg, the head of Nato has expressed worry that the fighting in Ukraine could spin out of control and become a war between Russia and Nato . \"If things go wrong, they can go horribly wrong,\" he said in an interview on Friday with to Norwegian broadcaster NRK.\n\nRussia wants to turn Ukraine into a \"dependent dictatorship\" like Belarus, the wife of jailed Belarusian Nobel peace prize laureate Ales Bialiatski said on Saturday upon receiving the prize on his behalf, speaking his words. Bialiatski, Russian rights group Memorial and Ukraines Centre for Civil Liberties won the 2022 prize in October.\n\nMoscow announced it is banning 200 Canadian officials from entering Russia in response to similar sanctions from Ottawa. The health minister, Jean-Yves Duclos, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce head, Victor Dodig, were among those targeted.\n\nBoris Johnson has urged western countries to \"look urgently\" at what more they can do to support Ukraine in the hopes of ending the war against Russia as soon as next year. In an article in the Wall Street Journal, he argued that ending the war as soon as possible is \"in everyones interest, including Russia\".\n\n11 Dec 2022 06.43 EST Here are some images coming to us over the wires from Ukraine. In a cemetery in Mariupol, numbers mark the graves of unidentified residents killed during fighting in the city.

Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian Two people were killed and another five wounded after Russian troops shelled the southern region of Kherson, the governor said on Sunday. The city of Kherson was recaptured in November by Ukrainian forces during a Kyiv counteroffensive. On the messaging app Telegram, the governor, Yaroslav Yanushevich, said Russian forces hit a maternity ward, a cafe and an apartment building on Saturday, news agency Agence France-Presse reports. He added: The enemy again attacked the residential quarters of Kherson. Last night, two people were killed due to Russian shelling.\" Yanushevich said five others had been wounded in the city which was attacked with artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, tanks and mortars.\n\nUpdated at 06.28 EST\n\n11 Dec 2022 05.26 EST 'There must be accountability' in Ukraine conflict, says UK foreign secretary The UKs foreign secretary James Cleverly has said that there needed to be \"accountability\" for Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine. He referred to claims of rape and sexual violence being used as weapons while he was in Kyiv, and that he also heard \"very credible claims\" that Ukrainian children are being forcibly sent to Russia to be adopted. When asked by Laura Kuenssberg on her BBC show whether Putin should be tried for war crimes he did give not a definitive answer. He said: There absolutely must be accountability and that means the soldiers on the ground who are perpetrating these atrocities right up to the very top. There has to be accountability, including Vladimir Putin. Weve been supportive of the International Criminal Court, but we recognise there may be other vehicles and well work with our friends, including the Ukrainians, in the international community to look about what an effective accountability framework would look like. He added: The message we need to send across the whole globe is that aggression does not pay off, that you cannot benefit by brutalising your neighbour. Addressing comments made by Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, that there was worry fighting in Ukraine could spin out of control and become a war between Russia and Nato, Cleverly said: Nato has made it clear that we are a defensive alliance. Nato has never threatened Russia and is not doing so now. Vladimir Putin has tried to create this narrative, but the bottom line is countries that join Nato do [so] voluntarily, there is no coercision and the alliance is there to protect its member states, not to threaten anybody else. So there is no inherent need for Nato to be drawn into a conflict and in fact we are trying to ensute that does not happen. He continued: Ultimately it is Vladimir Putin who is using the esculatory language. He is the one who has threatened further imperial expansion harking back to his focus on Russias historical empire. So it is him who is being the aggressor.\"\n\nUpdated at 06.47 EST",

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nSeveral blasts hits a hotel and restaurant complex known as the Hunter's Halt on the eastern outskirts of the city, area residents reported.\n\nIvan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, said the former complex was now being used to house 200-300 Kremlin-backed forces and that dozens of them had been killed or wounded.\n\nFedorov wrote on his Telegram channel that \"the wounded were immediately taken to hospitals in [Russia-occupied] Crimea because there are not enough places in Melitopol. Some ambulances are being converted into morgues.\"\n\nThe reports could not be independently confirmed.\n\nThe Ukrainian military did not provide specifics but said targets hit included barracks and were carried out with artillery and missiles.\n\nThe Russian-installed authorities said two people were killed and 10 injured in a missile attack around Melitopol, which was seized by Russian forces early following the invasion that began on February 24.\n\n\"Air-defense systems destroyed two missiles, and four reached their targets,\" Yevgeny Balitsky, the Moscow-appointed governor of the occupied part of the Zaporizhzhya region, wrote on Telegram.\n\nThe United States has provided Ukraine with high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARs), which are playing an increasingly important role in Ukraine's counteroffensives against Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nFierce fighting continued elsewhere as Ukrainian forces battled to hold of a Russian drive in the east.\n\nUkrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy has said Russian forces have turned Bakhmut into \"ruins\" in their continued attempt to encircle the strategic city in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, while the Ukrainian military has said it has thwarted the latest attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\nIn his nightly video address to the nation on December 10, Zelenskiy said the situation \"remains very difficult\" in several frontline cities in the two partially occupied regions that together make up the Donbas region.\n\n\"Bakhmut, Soledar, Maryinka, Kreminna: For a long time, there is no living place left on the land of these areas that has not been damaged by shells and fire,\" Zelenskiy said, naming cities that have been targeted by a recent Russian offensive. \"The occupiers actually destroyed Bakhmut, another Donbas city that the Russian Army turned into burnt ruins.\"\n\nEarlier the same day, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said it had successfully repelled attacks in Bakhmut, as well as in other cities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\nRussia identified capturing the entire Donbas region, parts of which had been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014, as a focus of its war campaign in Ukraine from the onset of its all-out invasion in February. Following military and territorial setbacks in Ukraine's south and east due to a recent Ukrainian counteroffensive, Russia has placed renewed focus on taking Bakhmut, a key Ukrainian supply hub, by massing troops and military equipment in an attempt to surround the city.\n\nOn December 10, the Russian Defense Ministry said Russian troops were also focusing their Donbas offensive in the direction of the Donetsk region city of Lyman, which is 65 kilometers north of Bakhmut, saying they had \"managed to take more advantageous positions for further advancement.\"\n\nIn his video address, Zelenskiy said the situation in Odesa, in southern Ukraine, was \"very difficult\" after energy infrastructure in the Black Sea port city was struck by Russian forces using Iranian-made drones.\n\nWATCH: Ukraine's Finance Ministry says demand for private bomb shelters has risen twentyfold since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the country in February.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the hits were critical, so it takes more than just time to restore electricity,\" Zelenskiy said. \"It doesn't take hours, but a few days, unfortunately.\"\n\nThe strikes by Iranian-made Shahed-136 \"kamikaze\" drones on two energy facilities left 1.5 million people in the city without power, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nMoscow has been targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure since October with waves of missile and drone strikes, leading to claims by Kyiv and rights groups that Russia is committing war crimes by trying to deprive Ukrainians of heat, electricity, and water as winter approaches.\n\nIran has come under criticism for supplying Russia with suicide and combat drones to boost the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters",

                "cc_text": "In wars 41st week, Moscow intensifies bombardment and Ukraine strikes deep inside Russia as its allies tighten sanctions but neither side appears ready for talks.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian forces fought vicious battles in Ukraines east without significant territorial changes over the past week, the 41st of the war, with neither side showing any willingness for immediate negotiations to put an end to the fighting.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine scored its deepest strikes in Russian territory yet and its allies squeezed Russia further on the economic front.\n\nUkraines long-range drones\n\nOn Monday morning, as it has frequently done in recent weeks, Russia fired some 70 missiles into Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv, Vinnytsia and Odesa. The attacks damaged energy infrastructure, which in some cases had just been fixed after being previously struck. Although Ukrainian officials said the countrys air defences had shot down more than 60 of these missiles, the successful strikes killed four people and plunged parts of the capital back into cold and darkness.\n\nRussia said the strikes were in retaliation for Ukraine using drones to strike two military bases, the Engels airfield on the Volga River and the Dyagilevo base near Ryazan. The two bases are 700km (435 miles) and 600km (373 miles) from the Russian-Ukrainian border, respectively, and represent Ukraines deepest strikes into Russia yet.\n\nPhotos posted on social media suggested Ukraine had used Soviet-era Tu-141 reconnaissance drones, which fly at high speed, have a range of 1,000km (621 miles) and could have bypassed Russian defences.\n\n\"The Ukrainians have decided to change the calculus of Russian [commander of Ukraine forces Sergei] Surovikin. The strikes against the Russian air bases is Ukraines way of saying that the Russians dont have the asymmetric advantage with their long range missiles that they think they have,\" wrote retired Australian army officer, Major-General Mick Ryan.\n\nIn an hourlong phone call on December 2, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had told Russian President Vladimir Putin that attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure must stop, only to be told they were \"an inevitable\" response to Ukraines \"provocative attacks\".\n\nBakhmut and the long, static war\n\nElsewhere, Russia maintained pressure on Bakhmut, a key city in the eastern Donetsk region that it has been trying to capture since the Ukrainian summer months with daily bombardments and ground assaults.\n\nUkrainian military spokesman Serhiy Cherevaty said Russia was sacrificing 50-100 soldiers a day in the effort, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Bakhmut and neighbouring Soledar the most difficult fronts of the war.\n\nThe leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic, Denys Pushilin, said although Russian forces had \"liberated\" 338 settlements in the Donbas, Ukraine was also bringing up reserves and mounting counterattacks.\n\nIt was not possible to independently verify the figures cited by both sides.\n\nRussias defence ministry said its forces quashed one counterattack on December 7 near the settlements of Pershe Travnya, Kurdyumovka, Klescheevka and Mayorsk in Donetsk. It also said it foiled Ukrainian counterattacks on the settlements of Chernopopovska and Zhytlovka in the neighbouring Luhansk region. But if nothing else, these showed that Ukraine has not given up on the two eastern regions whose large parts are under Russian control.\n\nPushilin also told Russia 24 TV station that Russian troops were advancing on Avdiivka and Pervomaiskoye in Zaporizhia region, just south of Donetsk.\n\nMeanwhile, US national intelligence chief Avril Haines said on Saturday Ukraine was in for months of slow-paced war.\n\n\"Were seeing a kind of a reduced tempo already of the conflict and we expect thats likely to be what we see in the coming months,\" Haines told the annual Reagan National Defence Forum in California. \"I do think [Putin] is becoming more informed of the challenges that the military faces in Russia,\" she said.\n\nPutin admitted to the slowness of the campaign on Wednesday, when he said, \"As for the duration of the special military operation, well, of course this can be a long process.\"\n\nTightening sanctions\n\nWith battlefronts static, Ukraines Western allies moved to tighten the economic noose around Russia.\n\nThe G7, Australia and the European Union on December 2 agreed on a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian crude oil shipped to third parties.\n\nThe cap took effect on December 5, the same day as an EU ban on Russian crude oil imports.\n\n\"It is no secret that we wanted the price to be lower,\" Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas wrote on Twitter. The Baltic states Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania and Poland had insisted on a cap equalling roughly the cost of extraction.\n\n\"A price between 30-40 dollars is what would substantially hurt Russia,\" Kallas said.\n\nZelenskyy, too, expressed disappointment, calling it \"quite comfortable for the budget of a terrorist state\" and \"a weak position\" for Europe.\n\n\"Its only a matter of time [before] stronger tools have to be used anyway. It is a pity this time will be lost,\" he said.\n\nWhile the move applies to EU operators that insure and finance ships carrying Russian crude oil worldwide, it does not apply to Russian oil imports coming into the 27-member bloc through pipelines. Member countries such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia are heavily dependent on Russian pipeline oil and will be allowed to continue imports temporarily until they develop alternative supplies.\n\nBut the compromise included a sweetener. The EU will immediately move to a ninth package of sanctions targeting \"the military and defence sector, companies producing military equipment, or those who are planning the missile strikes\", foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.\n\nRussia already discounts its oil to $60, well below the Brent crude benchmark of $87, and the EU cap did nothing to upset that.\n\n\"We will not recognise any ceilings,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, adding that \"the adoption of these decisions is a step towards the destabilisation of world energy markets\".\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, in an interview with Indias NDTV, questioned the Indian governments neutrality and continued purchases of Russian oil.\n\n\"If you benefit because of our suffering, it would be good to see more of your help addressed to us,\" he said.\n\nUkraines deputy military intelligence head Vadym Skibitskyi said some missiles raining down on Ukraine were manufactured during the summer, by which time Western sanctions were supposed to have choked off Russias ability to acquire vital components for them, such as computer chips.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Russian Federation, due to the fact that it circumvents economic sanctions, is still able to produce a certain number of cruise missiles and other weapons,\" said Skibitskyi. He also said Russia was talking to Iran about replenishing its stocks of ballistic missiles.\n\nPeskov said problems caused by sanctions against Russia were \"of a non-critical nature\".\n\n\"The economy of the Russian Federation has the necessary potential to fully meet all needs and requirements within the framework of a special military operation,\" he said.\n\nReleased figures suggested that Russia has suffered, with its economy reducing in the third quarter of this year by 7.1 percent compared with before sanctions in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nTalks with preconditions\n\nNo party to the conflict seemed prepared for negotiations at this stage.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, whose mantra has been that Ukraine must decide when to come to the negotiating table, said on December 1 he was prepared to talk if there was an earnest desire for peace.\n\nUkraine places massive preconditions on talks, including a complete Russian withdrawal and reparations payments, which Moscow rejects, while placing its own conditions.\n\n\"If now there will be a serious proposal on how to stop this conflict while fulfilling our absolutely legal demands, of course, we will be ready to talk,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on December 7.\n\nJames Cleverly, Britains foreign secretary, told The Telegraph newspaper that a ceasefire would be disingenuous. \"A ceasefire is actually just used by Putin to train up more troops and to produce more ammunition and to refit his damaged armed forces and to rearm his armed forces,\" he said.\n\nThe human toll\n\nUkraine for the first time revealed estimates of its military deaths at 10,000 to 13,000.\n\nThe United Nations counted Ukrainian civilian deaths at 17,000, a figure believed to be an underestimation.\n\nUkraine estimated the number of Russian dead soldiers stood at more than 90,000. NATO has in the past said Ukraines figure is a realistic one for dead, wounded and missing Russian soldiers.\n\nThe UN said 14 million Ukrainians, about a third of the population, remained displaced as a result of the war: 6.5 million inside Ukraine and more than 7.8 million in the rest of Europe.",

Ukrainian officials claimed scores of Russian dead and injured while Russia conceded a handful of casualties.\n\nVideo footage posted on social media showed what was claimed to be a Russian barracks in the southern city engulfed in a fierce blaze with some claiming the site was being used by the Wagner mercenary group.\n\nAnother video showed rescue workers in the ruins with several bodies visible.\n\nThe site, a former resort and hotel complex next to a church in the city known as the Hunters Halt, was being used as a barracks with most of the casualties apparently in a mess hall when it was hit.\n\nThe strike on Melitopol reportedly with Himars rockets was one of several overnight on Russian bases. Explosions were also reported overnight in the Russian occupied Crimea including Sevastopol and Simferopol.\n\nA senior official in eastern Ukraine said on Sunday that Ukrainian forces had attacked a hotel where members of Russias private Wagner military group were based, leading to \"significant losses\".\n\nSerhiy Haidai, governor of the Russian-occupied Luhansk region, said forces launched a strike on Saturday on a hotel in the town of Kadiivka, west of the regions main centre of Luhansk. Photos posted on Telegram channels showed a building largely reduced to rubble. \"A huge number of those who were there died.\"\n\nRussias defence ministry was not immediately available for comment and his claims could not be verified.\n\nThe strike on Melitopol came as all non-critical infrastructure in the Ukrainian port of Odesa was without power after Russia used Iranian-made drones on Saturday to hit two energy facilities, leaving 1.5 million people cut off from electricity.\n\n\"The situation in the Odesa region is very difficult,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the hits were critical, so it takes more than just time to restore electricity It doesnt take hours, but a few days, unfortunately.\"\n\nIn Melitopol the pro-Moscow authorities said a missile attack on Saturday evening killed two people and injured 10, while the exiled Ukrainian mayor said scores of \"invaders\" were killed.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports of the attacks or deaths.\n\n\"Air defence systems destroyed two missiles, four reached their targets,\" Yevgeny Balitsky, the Moscow-appointed governor of the occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region, said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nHe said a \"recreation centre\" where people were dining was destroyed in the Ukrainian attack with Himars missiles.\n\nThe exiled mayor, Ivan Fedorov, said on his Telegram channel that the attack hit a church that Russians had turned into a gathering place.\n\nVladimir Rogov, another Moscow-installed official in the Russian-controlled part of Zaporizhzhia, said a fire caused by the strike engulfed the recreation centre. He posted a video of a structure in flames.\n\nHimars multiple rocket launchers have been among Ukraines most effective weapons in the war, delivering precision fire on hundreds of targets, including Russian command posts. On Friday, the United States said it was sending more aid to Kyiv to strengthen its air defences and defeat drones.\n\nThe city of Melitopol is seen as the next major objective for Ukrainian forces in the south of the country since Ukraine retook the major city of Kherson.\n\nWith Ukrainian forces now operating on the east bank of the Dnieper River, opposite Kherson, and with their forces now able to place Himars rocket systems on the west bank, Russian forces in the city have come under an increasing threat.\n\nOleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Melitopol, a major industrial and transport centre occupied by Russia since March, was the key to south.\n\n\"All logistics linking the Russian forces on the eastern part of the Kherson region and all the way to the Russian border near Mariupol is carried out through it,\" Arestovych said in a video interview on social media.\n\n\"If Melitopol falls, the entire [Russian] defence line all the way to Kherson collapses. Ukrainian forces gain a direct route to Crimea.\"\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian army about the attacks. Earlier in the day, the central command of Ukraines armed forces said it had been conducting strikes on Melitopol.",

He added that three sites had been hit, including a restaurant-hotel complex on the outskirts of Melitopol, known as \"Prival Okhotnika,\" or Hunters Rest, a checkpoint 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the city in Novobohdanivka, and a military unit that was \"completely destroyed\" near the village of Semenivka.\n\nYevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed governor of Zaporizhzhia region, where Melitopol is located, said that Ukraine had hit Melitopol using a HIMARS system, killing two people and wounding 10 others, three of whom were treated in the hospital a significantly lower number than was reported by Fedorov.\n\n\"Ukrainian HIMARS were launched on the outskirts of Melitopol. Two missiles were shot down by anti-aircraft defense, but four reached their target,\" Balitsky said in a post on Telegram on Saturday, sharing a video of emergency services responding to a huge blaze. He claimed the targets had included a \"recreation center,\" where civilians and military personnel were having dinner on Saturday night, but did not name it.\n\nFedorov claimed in an interview on Monday that Russian troops in the city were \"panicking\" and \"redeploying,\" given Ukrainian strikes on the city. Without providing any evidence, he said \"they are busy moving their military groups to other places to try to hide them.\"\n\nMelitopol, a southeastern city on the banks of the Molochna River, fell to Moscow in March soon after the invasion. The citys mayor was abducted by Russian forces and later released, while a pro-Kremlin administration was installed.\n\nMelitopol lies south of the city of Zaporizhzhia and to the east of Kherson city, which was recently recaptured by Ukrainian troops. It is a major Russian logistics hub and has been in Russian hands for several months, but has come under fire from Ukrainian counter-strikes in recent weeks.\n\nEmergency services respond to the aftermath of an attack in Melitopol. Citizen of Ukraine/Twitter\n\nOleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, underlined the importance of the city in comments made to local media outlet Feigin Live on Saturday.\n\n\"If Melitopol falls, the entire defense (of the occupiers) to Kherson collapses, the Ukrainian armed forces jump right to the border with Crimea on the isthmus,\" said Arestovych.\n\nThe attacks on Melitopol came as the Ukrainians also struck a hotel, which allegedly housed the Wagner mercenary unit in Luhansk.\n\nHeavy artillery, including the use of Grad missiles, was also reported in southern Ukraines Dnipropetrovsk region overnight, Valentyn Reznichenko, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, said on Telegram Monday.\n\nPower deficit after Russian drone strikes on Odesa\n\nKyivs attacks come as Russian strikes ramp up on Ukraines power grid, and growing warnings of the energy crisis gripping the country.\n\nAcross Ukraine, crews are scrambling to restore energy capabilities faster than Moscows troops can knock them out. Its a difficult, and increasingly dire fight as a long winter sets in.\n\nAll of Ukraines thermal and hydroelectric power stations have been damaged in the relentless Russian missile strikes targeting the countrys power system, Ukraines prime minister said Sunday.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that \"there is a significant [power] generation deficit\" in the countrys energy system, following eight waves of Russian attacks targeting critical infrastructure.\n\nA firefighter stands in front of burned market stalls hit by shelling in Donetsk on December 6. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\n\"All thermal and hydroelectric power stations were damaged, and 40% of the high-voltage network facilities were damaged to varying degrees,\" said Shmyhal. \"Each of us must realize that this winter we will have to live through with significant restrictions on electricity consumption.\"\n\nRussian drone strikes on Odesa, a key port city in southern Ukraine, plunged more than 1.5 million people into darkness over the weekend. Power and water supplies were gradually being restored to the city, but 300,000 still remained without power on Sunday, Odesa Mayor Hennadii Trukhanov said in a statement on Telegram.\n\n\"The situation is quite controlled, although not easy,\" he said, adding that his administration was re-launching pumping stations and delivering water by truck to zones where shortages continue.\n\nPresident Zelensky said Sunday in his nightly address that the countrys forces had shot down 10 of 15 drones that Russia deployed over Odesa a number that could not be independently verified. He called the strikes by Russian drones \"critical\" and suggested it would take a few days to restore the electricity supply in the region.\n\n\"The power system is now, to put it mildly, very far from a normal state,\" he said.\n\nThe port of Odesa is Ukraines key to exporting vital food products, including through its \"Grain from Ukraine\" initiative, which is aimed at addressing the global hunger crisis.\n\nUkrenergo, the Ukrainian state run energy provider, reported that there was still a \"significant power deficit\" in the grid.\n\n\"The situation in Odesa region is still difficult, the restoration of power supply to consumers continues,\" it said in a post on Facebook, adding that the destruction caused by Russian attacks \"does not allow to fully use the capacities of thermal power plants, additional time is needed to restore their work.\"",
