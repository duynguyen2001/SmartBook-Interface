Ukraine's Infrastructure Minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, has stressed the importance of faster ship inspections to increase grain export volumes, which is critical for the deal's effectiveness (6). Additionally, the U.N. is calling for diplomatic solutions and new mediation mechanisms that align with the U.N. Charter to foster member state unity and handle differences fairly, ensuring impartiality and adherence to the initiative's provisions (7). With these concerted efforts and an emphasis on maintaining unity among member states, the Black Sea Grain Initiative can be fortified to continue supporting global food security beyond its expiration date (6,7)."

The recent decline in global food staple prices could reverse, causing a resurgence in price increases for commodities like wheat and maize if the initiative is not renewed, adding to the challenges of ensuring food security (3). Furthermore, delays to shipments under the initiative, with over 150 vessels waiting, could disrupt the supply chain and port operations, leading to further potential impacts on global food availability (4).",

With its suspension, Russia is accused of weaponizing food and affecting low- and middle-income countries that are already suffering from food insecurity, heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic (1,2).\n\nShould the Initiative end, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization warns of rising commodity prices, such as wheat and maize, further threatening food security, particularly in developing and least developed countries (3). The World Bank has also highlighted that the war in Ukraine has disrupted global trade, production, and consumption patterns, suggesting that high food prices could persist through the end of 2024, worsening food insecurity and inflation. Additionally, the UN has called for urgent measures to prevent delays to shipments under the Initiative, as over 150 vessels are currently waiting, potentially causing supply chain disruptions (3,4,5). The collapse of the Initiative would thus remove a vital lifeline that has been mitigating the food crisis, with dire consequences for global food availability and prices (1,3,4,5,6)."

The Black Sea Grain Initiative, brokered by the UN and Turkey, was crucial in easing the blockade and facilitating safe corridor navigation for ships carrying grain from Ukraine, thus helping to mitigate global food shortages (3). However, the initiative is at risk due to delays and the backlog of ship inspections, with over 150 vessels waiting, potentially causing supply chain and port operation disruptions (4). To combat these risks, import-dependent countries need to develop contingency plans that might include seeking alternative supply sources, investing in domestic agricultural resilience, and participating in international agreements that ensure the continuity of food supplies.\n\nSuch contingency plans could be supported by collective action from tea producer associations, which are suggested to transition into marketing associations to address issues such as low pricing, growing input costs, and climate change consequences (2). Furthermore, the urgency of renewing the UN-led initiative is emphasized as a critical step for developing nations to maintain access to essential grain supplies (6). The involvement of international bodies like the Joint Coordination Centre for the Black Sea Grain Initiative plays a key role in ensuring safe maritime transportation (6), while the global community is encouraged to meet climate finance targets to support countries facing environmental shocks, which also affect food production and stability (8). Therefore, by diversifying supply chains, enhancing agricultural practices, and ensuring international support and cooperation, import-dependent countries can better prepare for and mitigate the risks of grain supply disruptions (2,6,8)."

Despite Russia's threats to leave the deal, the initiative has successfully moved over 9 million metric tons of food, critically supporting low- and middle-income countries by making grain more available and exerting downward pressure on food prices (2,3). However, there are concerns in agricultural markets about the potential collapse of the agreement, which if happens, could reverse the progress made in easing soaring grain prices (4). The importance of the initiative is underscored by the significant role Ukraine and Russia play in the global exports of wheat, barley, and maize, highlighting the potential impact on food security if the grain deal is compromised (5).",

This has been particularly beneficial for low- and middle-income countries, as the Initiative has moved more than 9 million metric tons of food, making grain more available and easing pressure on food prices, thus improving global access to food for the poorest and most vulnerable (2,3).\n\nHowever, the future of the Initiative remains uncertain, with concerns that one party could withdraw from the agreement (4). Such a move could reverse the downward trend in food prices seen since April 2022, as reported by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO's) food price index has indicated falling prices since the Initiative took effect, but prices are showing signs of increasing again due to uncertainties regarding the renewal of the agreement (8). The initiative has been critical in alleviating a global food crisis, particularly as Ukraine and Russia are major producers of wheat, barley, and maize, and their combined exports account for significant shares of the global market (5)."

The delays, caused by the slow inspection process of ships carried out by the Joint Coordination Centre, are of significant concern as they have the potential to disrupt the supply chain, affecting the global transportation of grain and other foodstuffs from Ukrainian ports (4). In response, the Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister emphasized the need for faster ship inspections to increase the export volume and prevent further queues (5).\n\nHowever, Russia's suspension of its participation in the initiative \"for an indefinite period\" raises questions about the future of this critical agreement (6,8). With the deal set to expire and uncertainty about its renewal, the potential disruption to the grain supply could have global consequences, particularly for food security in developing countries (10). While contingency plans were not explicitly detailed in the provided contexts, the urgency expressed by the UN and infrastructure officials suggests that discussions and efforts are likely underway to address these potential disruptions and find solutions to maintain the flow of grain exports (1,5)."

The United Nations is actively calling for urgent measures to prevent intentional delays to food shipments under the agreement, highlighting the need for accurate interpretation and rational restraint by all parties involved (1,2). Additionally, maintaining unity amongst Member States and addressing differences of opinion in a fair and appropriate manner is crucial for the negotiation process, as encouraged by China in the context of Council resolution 2233 (2015) (1). Furthermore, the international community should pressure Russia to resume its participation in the Initiative and fully comply with the arrangement to prevent the weaponization of food and the exacerbation of humanitarian crises and food insecurity (5).",

The UN, having brokered the deal, maintains communication with Moscow to encourage compliance, emphasizing the critical humanitarian impact of the initiative which facilitates access to food for millions worldwide. The organization also urges Russia to resume its participation and fully comply with the arrangement, highlighting the negative consequences of any disruption on low- and middle-income countries and global food prices (5,9).\n\nTo resolve disputes and ensure compliance, the UN underscores the importance of transparent and impartial mediation mechanisms, as emphasized by China's GENG SHUANG (1). Additionally, the involvement of member states like Turkey is instrumental, as evidenced by the Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov's meeting with Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar to discuss the continuation of the grain deal and the efficiency of ship inspections (10). Such diplomatic engagements and the readiness to examine information provided by member states (6) are key to preventing further complications and maintaining the initiative's momentum. With the deal's expiration approaching, Ukraine has affirmed its continuation post-November 22, despite Russia casting doubt on its future, showcasing the international community's commitment to overcoming challenges associated with the initiative (10)."

As of 19 October, the total tonnage of grain and other foodstuffs exported through the initiative had reached almost 8 million metric tons.\n\n\"The UN-led Initiative has helped to stabilize and subsequently lower global food prices and move precious grain from one of the worlds breadbaskets to the tables of those in need,\" the report says.\n\nThe Food Price Index published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has shown that the prices of global food staples have declined in recent months by about 8.6% in July, 1.9% in August and 1.1% in September.\n\nBut with the initiative ending in November and its renewal uncertain, the prices of some commodities, such as wheat and maize, are rising again, the report warns.\n\nWithout the initiative, there is little hope for providing food security, especially in developing and least developed countries.\n\nIncreasing port activity\n\nAs the war erupted in Ukraine, the world watched as valuable grain corridors were closed off. Weekly ship departures from Ukrainian ports plummeted.\n\nThere was a marginal recovery in subsequent weeks but port departures remained considerably below their 2021 levels. After the signing of the UN-led initiative, there was a gradual rise in ship departures.\n\nWhile shipments are still about 40% to 50% below the pre-war period, the trend is in the right direction.\n\nUnder the UN-led initiative, three seaports have been reopened Odesa, Chornomorsk, Pivdennyi/Yuzhny. As a result, the number of port calls has increased and more importantly, the volumes carried have risen significantly.\n\nWeekly tonnage of grain shipped under the initiative reached 1.2 million tons by September. This is still below 2021 levels, but the gap is closing.\n\nGrain gates reopened\n\nThe initiative reopened the grain gates of Ukraine to the world, and particularly to developing countries.\n\nMaize and wheat account for more than 70% of the nearly 8 million tons of grain that have left Ukrainian ports under the initiative. Nearly 20% of the wheat exports have gone to least developed countries (LDCs) with vulnerable populations.\n\nThe initiative doubled the amount of wheat shipped to LDCs between August and September about half a million tons.\n\nBut wheat exports to LDCs between January and September 2022 totalled less than 1 million tons. This implies an export gap of 1.2 million tons with respect to 2021. More needs to be done to match previous levels of exports.\n\nPushing down food prices\n\nThe initiative has helped to make grain more available and eased pressure on food prices. This has in turn helped to improve global access to food, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable.\n\nThe prospect of the initiative and the reopening of the Black Sea ports helped to push down historically high market prices.\n\nBut prices are rising again amid mounting concerns about whether the initiative will be renewed, and the threat of further disruptions to trade in the Black Sea and the closure of grain corridors.\n\n\"In a context where trade is very uncertain, signals matter very much,\" UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan said. \"When there is no clarity, no one knows what is going to happen, and speculation and hoarding take over.\"\n\nWheat and maize prices are still at historically high levels. This weighs on the affordability of basic foods and poses a risk to food security globally.\n\nThis is one more reason why the renewal of the UN-led initiative is important for developing countries.\n\nThe report was produced with contributions from the Joint Coordination Centre for the Black Sea Grain Initiative, comprised of senior representatives from Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Trkiye and the UN, which ensures the safe maritime transportation of grain and other foodstuffs from the three key Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea to the rest of the world.",

A judge to fill Trindades place to finish the term until Feb. 5, 2027 must be voted on by the UN General Assembly, set for early November, and ratified by the Security Council. Traditionally, the ICJ seat is filled by a person of the same nationality as the vacated justice. Members of the academic community of international law in Brazil have submitted a candidate, Paulo Borba Casella, who teaches at the University of So Paolo and has openly denounced Jair Bolsonaros actions during the course of his presidency. But Bolsonaros government has submitted a name as well, Leonardo Nemer Caldeira Brant, a judge and scholar in international law. He ran unsuccessfully in 2014 as a judge for the International Criminal Court; recently, one Brazilian media site reported that he was seen campaigning for the ICJ seat accompanied by Senator Flvio Bolsonaro, son of the president. Complicating matters, Argentina has also submitted a name, Marcelo Gustavo Kohen, to run. According to ICJ rules, the nomination of candidates is made by jurists, judges, academics and personalities of a given nationality who are also part of other international courts, and not nominated by governments. According to Article 4 of the courts statute, \"the members of the Court shall be elected by the General Assembly and the Security Council from a list of persons presented by the national groups of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.\" The fear among Brazilian scholars who back Casella is that Brazil could lose the ICJ seat altogether, given the competitive circumstances.

The three-member commission, which focuses on the Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel, is led by Navi Pillay, a former UN high commissioner for human rights. The commission is pushing for the issue to be referred to the International Court of Justice, the UNs highest court.\n\nThe prospect of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the reopening of three Black Sea ports in Ukraine since Russias invasion of Feb. 24 have helped to push down historically high market prices, according to a new report by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). Since April 2022, the Food and Agriculture Organizations food price index has followed a downward trend, but prices are rising again amid concerns as to whether the initiative will be renewed on Nov. 22, the UN said. (To withdraw from the deal, a party needs to send notification to all the parties: the UN, Trkiye, Russia and Ukraine.) But as PassBlue reported in last weeks summary, Russian diplomats at the UN in New York City and in Geneva are saying that Russia will not renew the initiative because, as Dmitry Polyanskiy, the deputy permanent representative to the UN, said on Oct. 19, Russia is not benefiting from the grain deal, although his complaints were vague (see video below). Additionally, a source familiar with the negotiations to keep the grain deal alive (led by Rebeca Grynspan of Unctad, and Martin Griffiths, the UN humanitarian relief chief), told PassBlue that Russia has been slowing the inspection of cargo ships leaving the Black Sea ports to pressure the UN in the talks. The record from the Istanbul-based Joint Coordination Center, which oversees aspects of the deal, shows that the required inspection of cargo ships by all four parties has been inconsistent since late September. The Telegram message below describes Griffithss meeting in Moscow with Russian officials on the grain deal.\n\nRussias dep PR to the #UN says Ru just wants the same benefits that #Ukraine is getting from the #BlackSea grain deal; says it was a 2-part plan But the UN-Ru side deal is much vaguer in commitments, so no comparison pic.twitter.com/P71Hoh8x35 PassBlue (@pass_blue) October 20, 2022\n\nMichael Carpenter, the US envoy to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, tweeted that Russias threats not to renew the Black Sea deal are related to the UN General Assemblys overwhelming vote on Oct. 12 to condemn Russias illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory. (No word to drop the deal has actually come from the Kremlin yet.)\n\nFriday, Oct. 21\n\nSpokespersons briefing: Martin Griffiths, the UN humanitarian relief chief, spent Thursday in Burkina Faso. He said that what he saw and heard \"left a deep impression on him,\" the spokesperson, Stphane Dujarric, noted. The landlocked country in West Africa, which has undergone two coups this year and is burdened with a growing jihadist threat, is facing escalating humanitarian needs. A quarter of the population, or about 4.9 million people, need emergency aid, 40 percent more people than at the beginning of the year. One in 10 Burkinab is displaced from his or her home \"by devastating conflict and climate shocks.\" The UNs $805 million response plan for the country is only a third funded. Griffiths met with the new junta-ruling president, Ibrahim Traor, where Griffiths said he \"stressed the need for protection of civilians, including for those unable or unwilling to leave areas of military operations.\"\n\nThe Security Council held a session, led by France and Mexico, updating members on the continuing humanitarian catastrophes in Ukraine. Denise Brown, the new UN resident coordinator in the country, was among the briefers. In describing the toll of the war, she said: \"Deaths and sufferings of civilians, ravaged urban and rural areas and total loss of livelihoods for millions. This is the impact of the war on the civilian population of Ukraine now in its 239th day.\"\n\nICYMI:\n\nThe Global Governance Project launched its latest publication, \"Health as a Political Choice-Investing in Health For All\" at the Berlin World Health Summit. (PassBlue recommends Soon-Young Yoons essay on the intersection of gender equality, health and climate change.)\n\nThe Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Securitys new season of its podcast series \"Seeking Peace,\" on women peace-builders runs from Oct. 24-Nov.21. Produced with the UN Department of Peace Operations, the 5-series episode \"explores womens roles in bringing peace to communities through grass-roots activism, peace negotiations, journalism, politics or as uniformed peacekeepers, the descriptor said. The focus in the series is on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, South Sudan, Mali and Kosovo.\n\nAn international expert conference on the reconstruction of Ukraine is scheduled in Berlin on Oct. 25.\n\nWe welcome your\n\nWe welcome your comments on this article. .

Inflation is predicted to be worse in developing economies, where price increases are projected to reach 9.9% on average over the course of this year. In developed nations, this number was put at 7.2% by the IMF, Statista said in a note on October 20.\n\nAfter the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February, the organisation revised its inflation projections upwards by 3.3% for developed countries and 4% for developing nations. This shows that even before the war in Ukraine disrupted global energy and food supplies, inflation projections had already been quite high as supply chains overstretched by restocking needs after the end of major coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns had already caused inflation to rise to levels not seen since the aftermath of the Great Recession. Because many developing nations are experiencing economic growth, inflation is generally higher on average in this group of countries. But this doesn't mean that inflation cannot hit non-industrialised countries hard if it happens at a time when their economies are struggling.\n\nCountries experiencing conflict, upheaval or major economic problems in 2022 are expected to see inflation rates far above the global average of 8.8%. Among them are Venezuela, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Turkey and Argentina. 95 countries from the developed and the developing world are projected to see inflation above 5% but below 10%. This is more than the around 80 that are expected to keep inflation at or below the 5% mark.\n\nYou will find more infographics at Statista",

But evidence of HDP on long term mortality in offspring from birth to adolescence and beyond is lacking.\n\nTo address this knowledge gap, researchers set out to examine the association of HDP among mothers with overall and cause specific mortality in offspring from birth to young adulthood.\n\nDrawing on data from Danish national health registers, they tracked 2.4 million individuals born in Denmark between 1978 and 2018 from date of birth until date of death, emigration, or 31 December 2018, whichever came first.\n\nTheir main outcome of interest was death from any cause (\"all cause mortality\"), followed by 13 specific causes of death in offspring from birth to young adulthood, up to age 41 years.\n\nThese included deaths from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, mental and behavioural disorders, diseases of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems, and birth defects.\n\nPotentially influential factors including sex of offspring and mothers age at childbirth, as well as mothers education level, income, living arrangements, smoking during pregnancy, and medical history were taken into account.\n\nOf 2,437,718 offspring included in the analysis, 102,095 (4.2%) were exposed to HDP before birth, including 68,362 (2.8%) exposed to pre-eclampsia or eclampsia and 33,733 (1.4%) exposed to hypertension.\n\nDuring an average 19-year follow-up period, deaths occurred in 781 (59 per 100,000 person years) offspring born to mothers with pre-eclampsia, 17 (134 per 100,000 person years) born to mothers with eclampsia, 223 (44 per 100,000 person years) born to mothers with hypertension, and 19,119 (42 per 100,000 person years) born to mothers with no HDP.\n\nThe results show that all cause mortality was higher in offspring exposed to HDP from their mothers compared with the non-exposed group.\n\nOffspring exposed to HDP had a 26% higher risk (55 per 100,000 person years) of all cause mortality than non-exposed offspring. The associated increased risk for pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and hypertension was 29% (59 per 100,000 person years), 188% (134 per 100,000 person years), and 12% (44 per 100,000 person years), respectively.\n\nOffspring whose mothers had severe and early onset pre-eclampsia had more than six times the mortality risk than offspring whose mothers had no HDP. A strong association was also seen among offspring of mothers with HDP and a history of diabetes or low education level.\n\nIncreased risks were seen for several cause specific deaths too. For example, deaths from digestive diseases and from conditions originating in the perinatal period (during pregnancy or in the first year after birth) more than doubled among offspring exposed to maternal HDP, while deaths from endocrine, nutritional, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases increased by more than 50%.\n\nThe researchers did not, however, find a significant association between maternal HDP and cancer deaths in offspring.\n\nThis is an observational study, so cant establish cause, and the researchers acknowledge that they could not rule out the influence of some unmeasured factors, such as smoking, alcohol use, poor diet quality, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle in offspring.\n\nThey also point out that Denmark has universal health coverage with high quality health services, which might limit the generalisability of the findings.\n\nNevertheless, this was a large, long term study based on high quality national health data. Results were also consistent after additional sibling analysis to consider the effect of genetic factors and some unmeasured family factors, suggesting that they are robust.\n\nAs such, the researchers say this study provides strong evidence that maternal HDP, particularly eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia, is associated with increased risks of overall mortality and various cause specific mortalities in offspring from birth to young adulthood.\n\nFurther research to examine the underlying physiological mechanisms between maternal HDP and mortality in offspring is needed, they add.\n\n[Ends]\n\nNotes for editors\n\nResearch: Maternal hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and mortality in offspring from birth to young adulthood: national population based cohort study doi: 10.1136/ bmj-2022-072157\n\nJournal: The BMJ\n\nFunding: National Natural Science Foundation of China, Shanghai Rising-Star Program, Shanghai Municipal Natural Science Foundation, Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project, Independent Research Fund Denmark, Nordic Cancer Union, Karen Elise Jensens Fond, and Novo Nordisk Fonden\n\nLink to Academy of Medical Sciences press release labelling system:\n\nhttps://press.psprings.co.uk/AMSlabels.pdf\n\nExternally peer reviewed?

The climate crisis has had an impact on the environmental and social determinants of health across Africa, leading to devastating health effects, explain the authors.\n\nIn West and Central Africa, for example, severe flooding resulted in mortality and forced migration from loss of shelter, cultivated land, and livestock, while extreme weather damages water and food supply, increasing food insecurity and malnutrition, which causes 1.7 million deaths annually in Africa.\n\nChanges in vector ecology brought about by floods and damage to environmental hygiene has also led to increases in malaria, dengue fever, Ebola virus, and other infectious diseases across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn all, it is estimated that the climate crisis has destroyed a fifth of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the countries most vulnerable to climate shocks.\n\nThe damage to Africa should be of supreme concern to all nations, they write, because in an interconnected world, leaving countries to the mercy of environmental shocks creates instability that has severe consequences for all nations.\n\nThey argue that achieving the $100bn a year climate finance target is now \"globally critical if we are to forestall the systemic risks of leaving societies in crisis,\" and say additional resources for loss and damage must now also be introduced.\n\nThey acknowledge that some progress has already been made, including early warning systems and infrastructure to defend against extremes, but point out that frontline nations are not compensated for impacts from a crisis they did not cause.\n\nThis is not only unfair, but also drives the spiral of global destabilisation, as nations pour money into responding to disasters, but can no longer afford to pay for greater resilience or to reduce the root problem through emissions reductions, they warn.\n\n\"The climate crisis is a product of global inaction, and comes at great cost not only to disproportionately impacted African countries, but to the whole world,\" they write. \"Africa is united with other frontline regions in urging wealthy nations to finally step up, if for no other reason than that the crises in Africa will sooner rather than later spread and engulf all corners of the globe, by which time it may be too late to effectively respond.\n\n\"If so far they have failed to be persuaded by moral arguments, then hopefully their self-interest will now prevail,\" they conclude.\n\nLukoye Atwoli, Professor and Dean of Medical College East Africa and Associate Director of Brain and Mind Institute said: \"It is time the global community acknowledges that the climate crisis, while disproportionately affecting the continent, is a global crisis. Action must begin now, and begin where it is hurting most, in Africa. Failure to act will make the crisis everyones problem very soon.\"\n\nBob Mash, Editor of the African Journal of Primary Health Care and Family Medicine and President of the South African Academy of Family Physicians said: \"In Africa we are already seeing the devastating effects of climate change on peoples health and the need to strengthen community-oriented primary health care is now more than ever.\"\n\n[Ends]\n\nNotes for Editors\n\nEditorial: COP27 Climate Change Conference: urgent action needed for Africa and the world doi: 10.1136/bmj.o2459\n\nThe editorial is being published simultaneously in 259 international journals.

Since the start of the war in February, Ukraine has kept shut the Soviet-era pipeline that transports ammonia from the town of Togliatti in southern Russia to the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Pivdennyi.\n\nKachka said that Kyiv fears a massive explosion if the more than 1,000-kilometer-long above-ground pipeline is hit by shelling.\n\n\"Shipment of ammonium will be as safe as grain in this corridor,\" Kachka said, but when it comes to the above-ground pipeline, \"the [gas] volume is so big that any shelling can lead to disastrous consequences.\"\n\n\"Everyone is interested [in continuing] this initiative, everyone is conscious about this,\" Kachka said. \"[The] trade universe is so strong that it overcomes many risks if there is a possibility to trade.

Expressing concern over the destruction of critical energy infrastructure such as power plants, she recalled that attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law.\n\n\"We are on a path of further escalation, which can only cause more suffering to the people of Ukraine, Russia, and the rest of the world. This trajectory must be reversed,\" she said, underscoring that any further damage to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant could have catastrophic consequences. She further expressed concern over Moscows decision to introduce martial law in the regions of Ukraine that are or have been under the temporary military control of the Russian Federation, along with the announced evacuation in Kherson amid intensified fighting on the ground.\n\nDenise Brown, United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, reported that temperatures are plummeting in the country as winter approaches amid the devastation of the energy supply, telecommunications and transport infrastructure, affecting access to water, electricity, heat and the ability to communicate. She warned of an increased risk of even more deaths in the months ahead because civilians do not have access to essential services, expressing particular concern over people who cannot be reached in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nIn the ensuing debate, many speakers condemned the alleged transfer of unmanned aerial vehicles from Iran to the Russian Federation in violation of Council resolution 2231 (2015), with the representative of Mexico stressing the need to adhere to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 without exceptions. The degree of sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking in the conflict was spotlighted by many delegates, with Norways representative calling on parties at all levels to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law.\n\nThe representative of Ukraine, calling attention to the mass graves, illegal annexation of its territory and deliberate attacks on critical energy infrastructure as well as 51,412 civilian infrastructure facilities, urged the United Nations to ramp up its assistance and protection services as well as to provide Kyiv with power-generating equipment. Turning to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles of Iranian origin, he stressed that Tehran must face serious consequences for escalating the Russian Federations war of aggression and called for investigations to start immediately.\n\nEchoing his point, Irelands delegate expressed concern over the use of Iranian-supplied unmanned aerial vehicles as their acquisition by Moscow contravenes Council resolution 2231 (2015). \"The unconscionable attacks on civilian targets aim to intimate and terrorize the civilian population, represent a blatant disregard for human life and constitute a serious violation of international law,\" he emphasized, adding that the aggressor must also be held accountable for the targeting of civilians, arbitrary detention, human trafficking and conflict-related violence.\n\nIn the same vein, the representative of the United States pointed out that there is publicly available documentation, including photographs and videos, of Mohajer and Shahed unmanned aerial vehicles being used against Ukraine, urging the United Nations to investigate any violations of the Council resolutions. Addressing the Council members that have never mentioned the Russian Federation, he asserted that \"their calls for diplomacy only enabled Russia as it commits further abuses\".\n\nAs a refute to these allegations, the Russian Federations representative described the references to destroyed civilian infrastructure as \"one-sided\", as they did not touch on damage inflicted by Kyiv in Donbas as well as acts of terror against a Crimean bridge and on the Zaporizhzhia power plant. If a \"pseudo-investigation\" takes place in this context, he warned, Moscow could reconsider its relations with the Secretariat, as it would have demonstrated itself as not being impartial.\n\nOffering a different perspective, Kenyas delegate called on States to open channels of communication and for the Council to accelerate its reforms, lest the war in Ukraine be remembered as the beginning of a third world war. \"The present format will lose its relevance and be overtaken by competing multilateral arrangements,\" he continued. He also emphasized the importance of adequate investments to ensure Africas self-sufficiency on food.\n\nTouching on the recent exchange of prisoners between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, the representative of United Arab Emirates noted that while momentum towards broader negotiations is still lacking, these exchanges show the potential for positive outcomes, along with agreements on food and fertilizer exports. Compromise, diplomacy, and dialogue remain the only way forward to prevent further suffering, he stressed.\n\nAlso speaking today were representatives of France, China, India, Brazil, Ghana, United Kingdom, Albania, Gabon (in its national capacity), Slovakia, Germany, Poland and Greece, as well as the European Union in its capacity as Observer.\n\nThe meeting began at 3:06 p.m. and ended at 5:32 p.m.\n\nBriefing\n\nROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said that as of 18 October, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded 15,956 civilian casualties in Ukraine: 6,322 killed and 9,634 injured since 24 February. Between 10 and 18 October, she added, at least 38 Ukrainian civilians were reportedly killed and at least 117 injured by missile and drone attacks against cities and towns across the country. Also expressing concern over the destruction of critical energy infrastructure such as power plants, she cited the Ukrainian Governments report that 30 per cent of its energy facilities have been hit since 10 October, most notably in Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Lviv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions. Recalling that attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, she deemed it essential that OHCHR be given complete and unimpeded access to all areas of Ukraine to continue its work.\n\nSharing the recent report submitted by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to the General Assembly, she stated that there are reasonable grounds to conclude that war crimes and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in Ukraine since 24 February. The Commission stated that Russian troops were responsible for the vast majority of the violations identified, while Ukrainian forces have committed international humanitarian law violations in some cases, including two incidents that qualify as war crimes, she pointed out. \"Accountability remains crucial as new allegations of atrocities have emerged in areas that have recently returned to Ukrainian Government control,\" she emphasized.\n\nWelcoming the recent announcement of an exchange of prisoners of war between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, in which 110 Russian captives were exchanged for 108 Ukrainians, she reiterated the Secretary-Generals appeal towards Moscow to grant full access to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to all prisoners of war, in accordance with international humanitarian law. Stressing that the Black Sea Grain Initiative has helped to bring down food prices and subsequently lower global food prices, with the total tonnage of grain and other foodstuffs exported reaching almost 8 million metric tons as of 19 October, she underscored the need to extend the initiative beyond November. It is equally critical that there be unimpeded access to Russian food and fertilizers, she added.\n\n\"We are on a path of further escalation, which can only cause more suffering to the people of Ukraine, Russia, and the rest of the world. This trajectory must be reversed,\" she went on. Further stating that any suggestion of the possible use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons only serves to further heighten tensions and could lead to a dangerous spiral, she underscored that any further damage to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant could have catastrophic consequences and therefore any military activity against, from or near the site must cease immediately.\n\nRecalling that the General Assembly had stated that the referenda held in regions of Ukraine that are or have been under the temporary military control of the Russian Federation and the subsequent attempted illegal annexations of these regions have \"no validity under international law and do not form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine\", she expressed concern over Moscows decision to introduce martial law in the regions, combined with the announced evacuation in Kherson amid intensified fighting on the ground. Noting that the Assembly had also expressed support for the de-escalation of the current situation and a peaceful resolution of the conflict through political dialogue, negotiation, mediation and other peaceful means, she added that \"an end to the war founded on international law and the Charter is the surest way to ensure that the tremendous suffering of civilians in Ukraine will cease.\"\n\nDENISE BROWN, United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, noted deaths and suffering of civilians, ravaged urban and rural areas, and total loss of livelihoods for millions are the impact of the war in Ukraine now in its 239th day. During a recent visit to Mykolaiv oblast, the mayor told her that since 24 February, they have only had 33 days without explosions and air raid sirens. The sheer depth of the humanitarian catastrophe is staggering, with almost 18 million people more than 40 per cent of the entire Ukrainian population needing humanitarian assistance, some 14 million forced to flee their homes, including 6.2 million internally displaced, and nearly 7.7 million refugees. The United Nations Human Rights Office has recorded over 15,900 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 6,300 killed likely an underestimation.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), some 5.7 million school-aged children have been affected since the start of the war, including 3.6 million due to the closure of educational institutions. She noted the World Health Organization (WHO) says there have been over 630 verified attacks on health care, barring the sick from medicines and treatment. Temperatures are plummeting in Ukraine as winter approaches, after the devastation of the energy supply, telecommunications and transport infrastructure, affecting access to water, electricity, heat and the ability to communicate. She warned there is an increased risk of even more death in the months ahead because civilians do not have access to essential services. International humanitarian law is very clear, she stressed: attacks must never be directed against civilians or civilian objects and constant care must be taken to spare them.\n\nAid focus is now on household repairs and the provision of blankets, mattresses, clothes, food, generators for schools and much-needed thermal heating for hospitals, with more than 590 humanitarian partners now delivering critical assistance and protection countrywide, she said. She noted over 13 million people have been reached across the country, but in accessible areas of Kharkiv, Kherson and Donetsk, the threat of landmines and unexploded ordnance contamination hinders humanitarian operations. The Ministry of Health and WHO report that 10 million people will need psychosocial support due to the trauma from the war, including women and girls suffering sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence, children hearing warning sirens daily, families who have been separated, or people just trying to survive every day.\n\nShe expressed particular concern over people who cannot be reached in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. The consequences of not delivering assistance to the estimated millions of people in these areas are dire, particularly with the winter months already having arrived and obstructions that leave the civilian population without the essentials to survive run contrary to this obligation. She noted the Flash Appeal has seen unprecedented donor support more than $2.9 billion has been received against requirements of $4.3 billion for this year. This is second most-funded country-level appeal in United Nations history, only behind Yemen in 2019 at $3.6 billion. The Ukraine Humanitarian Fund has also received significant new funding with more than $230 million in contributions and pledges, she noted, and of that, $117 million has already been disbursed, including $20 million for local volunteer organizations.\n\nStatements\n\nJUAN RAMN DE LA FUENTE RAMREZ ( Mexico ) said the figures of dead and wounded civilians in Ukraine will continue rising unless urgent action is taken. In light of the recent indiscriminate attacks against civilians and infrastructure, including those using unmanned aerial vehicles, which violate international humanitarian law, Mexico and France called for the meeting to discuss an analysis and solutions to the unfolding situation. He emphasized the need to adhere to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 without exceptions. Turning to the grave impacts on health services, with the WHO finding that there had been 630 recorded attacks against health-care systems, he stressed that the deliberate targeting of hospitals constitute war crimes and cannot go unpunished. Expressing alarm about cases of sexual and gender-based violence, he called for all such cases to be investigated and for effective redress provided to victims. Further, unfettered access to humanitarian assistance must be provided, and attacks against civilian infrastructure must cease. Turning to the issue of mines, which affect the safe operation of humanitarian assistance and pose challenges to agriculture, he called for urgent demining operations to be conducted. Moreover, the Black Sea Grain Initiative must be renewed to mitigate the conflicts impact on global food security. He went on to repudiate the threat of use of nuclear weapons and expressed regret that no safely demilitarized zone has been formed around the Zaporizhzhia power plant, despite recommendations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and appeals from the Secretary-General. Mexico urges parties to urgently heed these appeals, he said.\n\nNICOLAS DE RIVIRE ( France ) noted the Russian Federation has crossed a new threshold, pounding the cities of Ukraine indiscriminately for 10 days and deliberately choosing to strike civil infrastructure, in particular energy, in Kyiv, Sumy and Dnipro, and no longer even trying to conceal its crimes. By targeting civilians, Moscow is unabashedly violating international humanitarian law and the Charter of the United Nations, trying to terrorize and break the morale of the Ukrainian nation. It is banking on the suffering of civilians, including children. He urged Moscow to comply with international humanitarian law and to allow humanitarian actors access to civilian populations in the territories it claims to occupy, as well as to prisoners of war, including those placed in captivity in the Russian Federation. The abuses and destruction resulting from the aggression may constitute war crimes, and there will be no impunity for criminals. He called for the International Criminal Court to move forward quickly, going up the chain of accountability as far as it can. It is further well documented that the armed forces use Iranian drones in Ukraine, and the European Union yesterday adopted new sanctions against Iranian entities and individuals involved in the production and transfer of these drones. He called on Iran to immediately cease all forms of support for the war of aggression launched by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. He also condemned the complicity of Belarus, whose territory continues to be used for missile strikes. The General Assembly vote last week was final, he stressed: the Russian Federation is alone, and massively condemned by the international community.\n\nMICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO ( Kenya ) expressed concern over the escalation in military activity and the persistent threats regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction. All nuclear installations, including the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, must be protected, he urged. As the continued intensification of the conflict only further undermines the prospects for peace and potentially gives way to the strengthening of armed alliances in preparation for a protracted war, he called for the immediate cessation of hostilities. United Nations agencies must be granted unhindered humanitarian access to those in need, he continued. Efforts to deploy emergency food and energy security mechanisms must be accompanied by efforts to transform food systems in food-insecure regions. To that end, there must be adequate investments to ensure Africas self-sufficiency on food. In pleading for the war in Ukraine to not be remembered as the beginning of a third world war, he called on States to open channels of communication and for the Council to accelerate reforms. The present format will lose its relevance and be overtaken by competing multilateral arrangements, he warned.\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ) called on all parties to comply with international humanitarian law. Nuclear power plants, energy pipelines, bridges and other critical infrastructure are of great importance to public safety and social stability, he said, while urging all parties to exercise restraint. He further called on the international community to continue to provide humanitarian assistance and help neighbouring countries in ensuring the proper resettlement of conflict-affected peoples. The international community must also maintain the interrupted operation of global food, energy and financial markets by removing obstacles to international, economic and trade cooperation. The implementation of indiscriminate sanctions will only accelerate the transmission of the crisis by pushing up international commodity prices and destabilizing the global and industrial supply chain, leaving developing countries especially exposed to its deleterious impacts, he cautioned. The past eight months have proven that sanctions, pressure, bloc confrontation and political isolation are not effective ways to resolve the crisis, he added. He then spotlighted his countrys six-point initiative on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, its international food security initiative and its emergency humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.\n\nRAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI ( India ), describing the recent reports of attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine as \"deeply worrying\", noted that international principles and jurisprudence vest responsibility on parties to ensure that they are not targeted in situations of armed conflicts. Highlighting that all humanitarian aid and assistance must be primarily guided by the universal principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, he stressed that these measures must not be politicized. Pointing out that the conflict has exacerbated concerns over food, fertilizer and fuel security, particularly in the developing countries, he said that \"open markets must not become an argument to perpetuate inequity and promote discrimination\". Expressing hope that the grain deal agreed in July will be implemented by all parties earnestly, he added that this alone may not be sufficient to address concerns over food insecurity. Hoping that the international community will continue to respond positively to the call for humanitarian assistance, he expressed support for calls urging for guarantees of safe passage to deliver essential humanitarian and medical supplies.\n\nMOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB ( United Arab Emirates ) noted that in just one week, a third of Ukraines power stations are reported to have been knocked off the electricity grid at a critical time, leaving people without gas for cooking and heating with winter approaching. The international community must step up its support, and to this end, his Government announced $100 million in humanitarian aid earlier this week. However, other parts of the world cannot be neglected, and the international community must ensure that those most in need globally do not become an afterthought. In Ukraine, access remains a major hurdle for humanitarian organizations, and those unable to escape the fighting, such as people with disabilities, the elderly, and the sick, have become vulnerable to shifting battle lines. He reiterated the call on all parties to abide by their obligations under international law to ensure the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. Despite the deeply concerning developments, he noted some movement between the parties that has led to tangible, positive outcomes on concrete issues. While momentum towards broader negotiations is still lacking, prisoner exchanges show the potential for positive outcomes, and agreements on exporting of food and fertilizers were significant and positive steps. Compromise, diplomacy and dialogue remain the only way forward to prevent further suffering, he stressed.\n\nJOO GENSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO ( Brazil ) expressed regret over the continued suffering of Ukraines civilian population. There is no justification for the attacks perpetrated on civilian targets, he said, while noting the damage to the energy sector and its humanitarian impacts. The continuing reports of civilian casualties and attacks against civilian infrastructure attest to the need for opening channels of humanitarian dialogue, he stressed. Missile launches and drone strikes must be halted and unimpeded access to humanitarian assistance by those in need must be guaranteed by all parties. Turning to the Councils collective response to the conflict, he noted the increased frustration with the perception of insufficient efforts to facilitate a peaceful solution. The Council should actively contribute to all possible efforts towards a ceasefire, which includes exploring the ideas which have already been circulated, he urged.\n\nJEFFREY DELAURENTIS ( United States ) stressed that the Russian Federation has shown contempt for the Council since the beginning of its invasion. Pointing out that Iran has since August transferred Mohajer and Shahed unmanned aerial vehicles to Moscow, in violation of Council resolution 2231 (2015), he stated that these vehicles have been used in multiple attacks against Ukraine, including the massive barrage on 10 October that hit civilians and civilian infrastructure. Highlighting that there is significant publicly available documentation, including photographs and videos, of such vehicles being used against Ukraine, he urged the United Nations to investigate any violations of the Council resolutions. As a refute to \"Russias false assertion\" that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to captured foreign volunteers, he emphasized that Moscows obligations as a party to the Conventions and their first additional protocol apply to the detention and treatment of any individuals, including third-country volunteers. Addressing the Council members that have never mentioned the Russian Federation, he asserted that \"their calls for diplomacy only enabled Russia as it commits further abuses\".\n\nFERGAL MYTHEN ( Ireland ), in spotlighting the continued attacks on Ukraines critical civilian infrastructure including on hospitals and health-care facilities, said the Russian Federation has chosen the path of escalation. He expressed concern over the use of Iranian-supplied unmanned aerial vehicles as their acquisition by the Russian Federation contravenes Council resolution 2231 (2015). The unconscionable attacks on civilian targets aim to intimate and terrorize the civilian population, represent a blatant disregard for human life and constitute a serious violation of international law, he emphasized. The Russian Federation must comply with its obligations under international law and international humanitarian law, refrain from further escalation, prevent civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure and facilitate lifesaving humanitarian access without delay. The Russian Federation must also be held accountable for the targeting of civilians, arbitrary detention, human trafficking and conflict-related violence. There must be timely, credible investigations which rigorously document evidence and support witnesses, victims and survivors, he said, while appealing to the Council to assert its responsibility.\n\nKHALILAH HACKMAN ( Ghana ) noted too many people, especially women, children and the elderly, continue to suffer needlessly from the fighting that has engulfed many cities across Ukraine. The humanitarian statistics are indeed concerning, and it is also important to note the impact of the war on pre-existing humanitarian situations in other parts of the world where food aid is largely supplied from Ukraine. She called for the de-escalation of tensions and the intensification of diplomatic efforts to end the war now, rather than later, when the cost of reconciliation and reconstruction would be unbearable. Expressing gratitude for United Nations humanitarian agencies and their partners working under extremely difficult and dangerous operational circumstances, she welcomed the European Union announcement to provide Ukraine with humanitarian aid through the winter. As fighting intensifies, she called for new humanitarian corridors for the safe passage of civilians to areas of relative safety, recalling the success of the Mariupol evacuations. Condemning all human rights violations, she reiterated support for independent, transparent and thorough investigations of such violations, including conflict-related sexual violence. Apart from imposing severe hardships on the people, she warned that the deliberate destruction of energy infrastructure, water stations, hospitals, schools, ports and railroads all constitute gross violations of international law and the principles of international humanitarian law relating to armed conflict.\n\nJAMES KARIUKI ( United Kingdom ), in noting the renewed campaign of drone and missile strikes across Ukraine as well as the egregious attacks on Ukrainian civilians way of life, emphasized the impact on Ukrainians as winter approaches. The intent behind these attacks is clear, he said. The Russian Federation is subjugating Ukraine by instilling fear and attacking civilians using weaponry obtained from Iran in violation of Council resolution 2231 (2015). As its illegal and immoral actions must end, he called on the Russian Federation to stop its disinformation, misdirection and accusations that the West is responsible for the Russian Federations atrocities. It must heed the calls of the international community; respect its obligations under international law; stop the attacks on civilians, energy infrastructure and health facilities; and end the war, he stressed.\n\nMONA JUUL ( Norway ) said the briefers candid accounts leave no doubt about the devastation the war has brought upon the people of Ukraine, and affirmed that Norway will continue to stand with Ukraine and its people, against the Russian aggression, which is a gross violation of international law, and the United Nations Charter. She expressed alarm about the escalation and brutality of the recent seemingly deliberate Russian attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, with missiles and drones, which have killed civilians and hit power facilities across the country. \"These attacks have no military purpose\", she said, adding: \"The aim seems to be to terrorize the population. They are illegal and may constitute war crimes.\" On the human rights front, she expressed concern about sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking, which women and children are particularly exposed to, calling for their return to be facilitated. Pointing out that inquiries by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has concluded that Russian armed forces have committed violations of human rights and international humanitarian law amounting to war crimes, she called for justice for all victims, for survivors to be cared for and for all those responsible to be held accountable. \"But to stop these grotesque violations in the first place, this war must come to an end\", she stressed, calling on parties at all levels to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, including through support for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in fulfilling their mandate.\n\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) began his statement by expressing his puzzlement at the added value of including Slovakia, Poland and Greece in the meeting, stressing: \"This is not a debate but a briefing.\" He went on to characterize references to destroyed civilian infrastructure as \"one-sided\", as they did not touch on such damage inflicted by Kyiv in Donbas, and acts of terror committed on a Crimean bridge and on the Zaporizhzhia power plant. Recalling statements that the meeting was called due to an intensification of air strikes by the Russian Federation, he said: \"Lets take a look\", and proceeded to describe attacks over the past two months by \"the Ukrainian regime and their Western backers\", including some that employed \"Ukrainian terrorist methods of sabotage\". Such methods \"peaked\" on the attack on a Crimean bridge, which permitted the delivery of essential supplies to the peninsula, on which four people died, he said, stating that the crime was openly savoured by Ukrainian officials, with one even implying their responsibility for this strike.\n\nHe went on to state that his country knows what Kyiv is capable of after 8 years in Donbas; therefore, it countered the \"anti-people Zelensky regime\" using high precision missile strikes and the use of Russian drones to target infrastructure. \"This did not sit well with the West, who became hysterical\", he said, adding that plenty of cases exist on video of civilians and infrastructure targeted by the Ukrainian Defence Forces. Instead, he stressed, Ukraine and its Western backers are trying to publicize fake claims of violations of Council resolution 2231 (2015), taking issue with a letter disseminated by Germany, France and the United Kingdom today which appeals to the Secretariat in violation of Article 100 of the United Nations Charter.\n\n\"The United States went further, demanding an investigation, which the Secretariat has no authority to undertake\", he continued, calling the action outrageous. If such a \"pseudo-investigation\" takes place, the Russian Federation can reconsider its package of relations with the Secretariat, as it would have demonstrated itself to not be impartial, he warned. He went on to characterize the briefing as a smokescreen, which sought to portray Ukraine as \"an innocent victim in constant need of military assistance\". He went on to enumerate military equipment given to Ukraine by the United States, France and Germany, and cited instances of such equipment being wielded on Donetsk and Luhansk, and indiscriminate artillery shelling taking place on Russian territories. He also touched on other provocations, including the targeting of a dam on the Karachunivske Reservoir, and the reckless attacks on the Zaporizhzhia power plant. Further, he said Kyiv was responsible for attacks on its own civilians seeking to save themselves, including in the instance of a ferry shelled on 20 October, in which the wounded and killed included journalists. Moreover, the Russian Federation has not yet received a list of Ukrainian victims in Bucha, he said, adding that Ukraine has no evidence to confirm what they claim happened there, while Western countries take their words at face value. He went on to state that he would prefer not to listen to the spiteful tirades from the Ukrainian regime, which takes a strange perverse pleasure in doing so, adding: \"Regrettably, his outburst shows Kyivs lack of readiness for any type of dialogue, much less for a civilized one.\"\n\nFERIT HOXHA ( Albania ) said the Russian Federations attacks and targeting of key civilian infrastructure is another and higher level of cruelty. He urged the United Nations to verify that the drones used by the Russian Federation have been unlawfully imported from Iran in open breach of resolution 2231 (2015). What does the Russian Federation have to hide from an independent, impartial investigation as a routine exercise to examine evidence, he asked. Turning to the United Nations reports documenting patterns of summary executions, unlawful confinement, torture, ill-treatment, rape and other sexual violence, he said these monstrous atrocities, war crimes and crimes against humanity would one day be presented before a court. He then expressed concern over the formation of a new joint force between the Russian Federation and Belarus. Every denial regarding Ukraine had the exact opposite happening, he noted. In recalling the resounding response of the General Assembly, he called on the Russian Federation to end the war.\n\nMICHEL XAVIER BIANG ( Gabon ), Council President for October, speaking in his national capacity, noted the war in Ukraine is more and more deadly, with the humanitarian situation deteriorating, civilians and civilian infrastructure continue to be attacked and the use of unmanned war machines adding to the climate of terror. It is time for the Council to mobilize to put an end to the war, he stressed. Today, the international community is still taking an inventory of fears, atrocities and humanitarian distress, leaving every nation to side with one camp or the other, he noted. Silencing the guns is certainly the main aspiration of the Ukrainian people right now the aspiration of all people plagued by the insecurity generated by war and he called on the belligerents to respect international humanitarian law and Council resolutions. He further urged for a humanitarian truce in order to preserve access to drinking water, electricity, heating, medical care and the distribution of humanitarian aid, calling on the parties to engage in good faith negotiations to end this deadly war and achieve peaceful coexistence in the region.\n\nSERGIY KYSLYTSYA ( Ukraine ), in expressing regret that the Council must listen to continued lies, said the Russian Federation will one day be removed from the Council altogether. In reminding the Council of the Russian Federations words that its military does not pose a threat to Ukraines peaceful civilians nor impact critical civilian infrastructure, he spotlighted the mass graves, illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory and deliberate attacks on critical energy infrastructure and 51,412 civilian infrastructure facilities. He urged the United Nations to ramp up its assistance and protection services and provide Ukraine with power-generating equipment. As every part of the Russian regime is soaked with blood and permeated by crime, it is not surprising, he observed, that the Russian Federation has chosen a new commander who is infamous for his bloodthirsty and criminal nature.\n\nRussian terrorists, he continued, have mined the dam and aggregates of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, whose destruction would subject more than 80 settlements and hundreds of thousands of people to rapid flooding. There must be an international observation mission and the return of Ukrainian personnel to the power plant to prevent another act of terror and ensure immediate demining. Turning to the use of long-range unmanned aerial vehicles of Iranian origin, he called on States to stop the transfers of such vehicles, missiles and conventional arms. As Iran must face serious consequences for escalating the Russian Federations war of aggression, investigations should start immediately, he emphasized. The world must react preventively, he urged, to not let Kakhovka or another disaster happen.\n\nMICHAL MLYNR ( Slovakia ) condemned the Russian Federations ongoing, unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine. In expressing concern over the humanitarian situation, he was appalled by innocent civilian deaths, attacks on critical infrastructure and the scale of sexual- and gender-based violence. The Russian Federation does not understand the phrase \"enough is enough\", he said before noting the impact of energy infrastructure attacks on peoples access to water and heat. Turning to global food security, he called on the Russian Federation to enable the free and safe passage of agricultural delivery and shipping from Ukrainian ports. While no one can predict when the senseless war will end, reaching a truce and silencing the guns is not enough. Perpetrators cannot remain unpunished and must be brought to justice, he declared. In recognizing Ukraine as an independent, sovereign State with unquestionable territorial integrity, he urged the Russian Federation to fully implement the General Assembly resolution from 12 October.\n\nANTJE LEENDERTSE ( Germany ) said her country will continue to stand by the United Nations Charter wherever in the world it is breached and will continue to stand by Ukraine. Germany stands ready to support Ukraine in mitigating the devastation caused by the Russian Federations attacks, she affirmed, noting that next Tuesday Chancellor Scholz and President von der Leyen will host the \"International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine\" in Berlin. The conference will galvanize international support for Ukraines recovery and reconstruction, she added. The Russian Federation must change its course, fully respect the letter and spirit of the Charter and withdraw from Ukraine. Further, it must comply with the legally binding order of the International Court of Justice to immediately stop its military operations against Ukraine and withdraw.\n\nKRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI ( Poland ) noted the recent Kremlin decisions on military mobilization and illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory, coupled with aggressive nuclear rhetoric and mass air strikes against civilian infrastructure, indicate that Moscow has chosen the path of escalation. The Russian Federation wants to intimidate the civilian population and to destroy Ukraines energy infrastructure, which is critical, especially in the winter period. Due to the Russian Federation bombings over 3.5 million people are left without a roof over their heads, and there is the further issue of mines deliberately left behind by its forces. Shelling civilians is a war crime, he stressed. Civilians must not be taken hostage. Russian Federation forces have committed horrific atrocities, and Poland will continue to work with international institutions and Ukraine to ensure that those responsible for these barbaric acts are held accountable. His country is now home to over 1.3 million refugees. Emphasizing that the whole tragedy is purely man-made, he said the Russian Federation bears full responsibility for all the destruction and loss of life. He noted 143 Member States strongly reaffirmed Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity in its internationally recognized borders. This confirms without any doubt that no concessions are expected from Ukraine for peace to occur. He appealed to the members of the Council and the international community to increase pressure on Moscow to stop the war, enabling the international community to restore the shattered lives and livelihoods of Ukrainian people. \"Give peace a chance,\" he urged.\n\nBJRN OLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, stated that the Russian Federation must be held accountable for its violations of international humanitarian law, as evident in recent air attacks targeting critical infrastructure and terrorizing civilians in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. He also condemned the clandestine transfer of combat drones by Tehran to Moscow in its aggression against Ukraine, adding that the damage to the countrys energy infrastructure creates major challenges in view of the upcoming winter. Stressing the importance of collecting, consolidating and analyzing evidence of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses, he expressed support towards measures to ensure accountability, including investigations by the International Criminal Court. \"Responsibility extends to those who support the committed crimes first Belarus, and now Iran,\" he added. Highlighting that the deliberate destruction of Ukraines agricultural and transport infrastructure is causing global food supply chain disruptions, he showed support for the Secretary-Generals call to extend the Black Sea Grain Initiative beyond 19 November.",

But most of these studies have been short term, and the findings inconclusive.\n\nIn a bid to plug these knowledge gaps, the researchers set out to pool the available evidence on the potential associations between any amount of workplace exposure and waning lung capacity in long term population-based studies.\n\nThey searched research databases for relevant studies published up to September 2021 in English. All the studies included workplace exposure to a wide range of airborne emissions and particles, and waning lung capacity that had been tracked for at least a year and defined as annual loss of FEV1, FVC, or the ratio of both.\n\nExposures included: biological dust; mineral dust; combination of vapours, gases, dusts and fumes (VGDF); fungicides; herbicides; insecticides; aromatic solvents; chlorinated solvents; metals; fibres; or mists.\n\nThe final analysis included 12 studies, with monitoring periods lasting from 4.5 to 25 years. The number of participants ranged from 237 to 17833; their average age ranged from 33 to 60.\n\nPooled data analysis of the study results showed that any level of exposure to gases/fumes, VGDF, and aromatic solvents was strongly associated with waning FEV1, while cumulative workplace exposure for these three categories of agents indicated a similar trend.\n\nAny level of exposure to fungicides and cumulative exposures to biological dust, fungicides and insecticides were also associated with waning FEV1, but in relation to specific variables, such as age, gender, and smoking.\n\nNo statistically significant association was observed between exposure to mineral dust, herbicides, metals and FEV1 decline.\n\nThe methodological quality of all the included studies was rated as good, overall, but the number included in the final analysis was small, admit the researchers, who highlight other limitations that make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.\n\nThe lung function definitions werent uniform across studies; several methods were used to assess workplace exposures; and pre-existing inherited or occupational asthma wasnt accounted for. Categories of exposure were only crudely defined, and the researchers werent able to identify the specific constituents involved or the duration of exposures.\n\nDespite these limitations, the researchers nevertheless advise: \"Periodic workplace health surveillance and lung function testing in exposed occupations will help to identify respiratory disease at an early stage to control the exposure and to protect against further disease progression.\"\n\nNotes for editors\n\nResearch: Ever and cumulative occupational exposure and lung function decline in longitudinal population-based studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis doi 10.1136/oemed-2022-108237\n\nJournal: Occupational & Environmental Medicine\n\nFunding: None declared\n\nLink to Academy of Medical Sciences press release labelling system\n\nhttps://press.psprings.co.uk/AMSlabels.pdf\n\nExternally peer reviewed?

Itll include live missile launches and a deployment of strategic assets.\"\n\nHeres what NATO will be doing: On Monday, NATO will begin its annual nuclear exercise known as Steadfast Noon, with the US among the 14 nations participating. Its been conducted annually for over a decade, according to the Pentagon.\n\nThe exercise includes fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear warheads but there will be no live weapons aboard. The US will provide B-52 bombers flying from Minot Air Base in North Dakota. The major exercise area will be more than 625 miles from Russia. The goal is to ensure NATOs nuclear deterrent remains \"credible, effective, safe and secure\" the defense official said.\n\nAccording to NATO there will be up to 60 aircraft involved including advanced fighter jets, surveillance and tanker aircraft. Flights will take place over Belgium, the UK and the North Sea.\n\nBiden warns of unprecedented nuclear threat: Though the Russian exercise is routine, it comes after President Joe Biden issued a stark warning earlier this month about the danger of President Vladimir Putins nuclear threats as Moscow faces military setbacks in Ukraine.\n\n\"First time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have a direct threat of the use (of a) nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path they are going,\" Biden warned during remarks at a Democratic fundraiser in New York.\n\nHe added: \"I dont think theres any such thing as the ability to easily (use) a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon.\"\n\nAfter Bidens remarks, administration officials stressed that the US still has seen no evidence that Putin is moving toward using Russias nuclear capability, nor is there any intelligence showing hes decided to do so.\n\nUS and allies keeping a closer eye on the exercises: The tension over Ukraine means there will be even more scrutiny on the Russian exercise.\n\nThe exercise is expected to focus on strategic weapons, meaning tests of ballistic missile systems that Russia would be required to provide advance notice of under treaty obligations.\n\nNATO and US officials have said they are confident they will be able to accurately monitor any Russian nuclear activity during the exercise. \"We will remain vigilant not least in light of the veiled nuclear threats and the dangerous nuclear rhetoric we have seen from the Russian side,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday.",

                "cc_text": "The question in the title is perhaps a strange one to ask at a time when these two countries seem so powerful and aggressive, the former attacking Ukraine, the latter threatening to take Taiwan. Yet just as we saw Peak Japan around 1990, the evidence is mounting that Russia and China are heading down a similar path, for different reasons. First I will cover Russia, then China.\n\nRussia\n\nRussia has punched above its weight politically and militarily, thanks to the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in its possession, a leftover from the Soviet era. But its GDP is merely of the order of magnitude of Spain or Canada.\n\nRussias attempt to annex Ukraine has exposed the limits of Russian conventional military power. Although Russias nuclear threat remains, perhaps the major constraint to its use is the difficulty of creating a winning scenario.\n\nAt a fundamental level, Russia's decline is driven by demographics: alcoholism is rife, and the medical system is horrible according to Rand Corporation, Russia has the lowest male life expectancy of any developed country (58 years), and a low birth rate. The US Bureau of Census estimates that Russias rapidly greying population will decline from approximately 140mn today to around 110mn by 2050. The above estimates predate the Ukraine War, which triggered emigration of hundreds of thousands of young males and the death of many tens of thousands on the battlefield. Many of those emigrating are talented entrepreneurs, IT workers a veritable brain drain. Russias demographic implosion will affect its economic power and ability to project political and military power. And it is inevitable: it would take 30 years to reverse.\n\nAccording to geopolitical analyst Peter Zeihan, it is precisely this rapidly weakening situation that tempted Putin to seize Ukraine, before Russia experiences further relative decline.\n\nChina\n\nChina sees a similar pattern of demographic demise, but for different reasons. The one child policy (1980-2015) limited the majority of families to one child, making population decline inevitable. An excess of 30mn more males than females further limits new family formation. According to the South China Morning Post, the population of China is expected to halve (from its current level of around 1.4bn) by 2050. This would indubitably have an impact on GDP and superpower ambitions.\n\nThe 6%+ growth rates in past decades were fuelled by several drivers:\n\nMassive stimulus from rapid debt growth. According to the Institute of International Finance (IIF), Chinese debt now exceeds 335% of GDP. Since 2008, debt has been growing far faster than GDP. A construction boom that consumed close to a quarter of GDP, likely never to be seen again, given that Chinas property sector is way overbuilt and in crisis. China became the factory of the world. Globalisation is now in reverse, or at least seems to be taking a pause security of supply is now in vogue.\n\nNone of this is sustainable. Chinas economic growth in the first half of 2022 was a mere 2.5%.\n\nThe centralisation and autocracy of Chinas leadership (including zero Covid policy) negatively affects investment, entrepreneurship, capital flows and emigration.\n\nPresident Xis push for \"common prosperity\" to reduce the income and wealth gap and his call at the recent Party Congress for \"regulating the mechanism of wealth accumulation\" will further dampen entrepreneurship and catalyse capital flight. Financial markets are experiencing a major change in mood on China: post-Party Congress Chinese stock market indices and yuan exchange rates are plunging. Unless the government changes its tune, the trend will be difficult to reverse.\n\nWhile Chinas economy is larger than the US measured according to purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, the Centre for Economics and Business Research forecasts 2028 as the date when China surpasses the US in absolute terms. In my view, this is far from inevitable.\n\nChina may be tempted to seize Taiwan for reasons similar to Russia before its power relative to the US begins to wane.\n\nConcluding comments\n\nI do not mean to belittle issues facing the US extreme political polarisation, high debt levels, etc., but ultimately the US has a more powerful entrepreneurial and deeper technological base and much better demographics than Russia or China. The US has far more immigration, and baby boomers had more children in the US than in Russia or China.\n\nThe democratic system allows for renewal and fresh ideas every four years, as opposed to being locked into an autocratic leader for decades. Putin and Xi are on the way to transforming their countries into gerontocracies. Intuitively, it makes sense that societies where information flows freely are more innovative and productive. Remember the \"open society\" thesis for the US winning the Cold War? For the past 30 years, both China and Russia went through a period of relative openness, which allowed them to mount a significant challenge to the US. Their sudden lurch to closed systems may sow the seeds of their own demise. They are their own worst enemies.\n\nLes Nemethy is the CEO and founder of Euro-Phoenix Financial Advisors Ltd and a former official at the World Bank.",

The labour market is beginning to cool, with employment slowing amid the high inflation and increased uncertainty,\" the World Bank said.\n\nIt was warned that the rising inflation poses risks to poverty reduction going forward.\n\n\"In the absence of government support, the severity of the energy and food price shocks could result in a 13% increase in the number of the poor in the Western Balkans,\" the report said.\n\nTargeted measures\n\nWorld Bank's country director for the Western Balkans, Xiaoqing Yu, noted that the governments of the six Western Balkans countries are taking measures to curb rising inflation and energy crisis, but underlined it is crucial that such measures mitigate the impacts of these crises on the most vulnerable households and firms.\n\nIt was suggested that reforms should include measures to increase the level of market competition, remove entry barriers to business, increase retention and reinvestment among foreign investors, reduce barriers to female labour force participation, improve quality of education, and raise standards of governance, including digitalisation.\n\nThe ongoing crisis also highlights the need to accelerate the green transition in the region.\n\nMassimiliano Paolucci, the World Bank's country manager for North Macedonia and Kosovo, said that governments policy support to the energy vulnerable is an important step in the right direction, but measures need to be targeted and timebound to minimise fiscal risks.\n\n\"At the same time, the focus should also continue to be on long-delayed structural reforms to boost growth and create new jobs,\" Paolucci said.\n\nCountry manager for Serbia, Nicola Pontara, said that while growth projections for Serbia in 2022 and over the medium term remain unchanged, risks to this outlook are tilted to the downside.\n\n\"Costly energy imports have led to a significant deterioration of the current account deficit, which could widen to as much as 10% of GDP in 2022, while inflation remains stubbornly high,\" Pontara said.\n\nShaken by the Ukraine war\n\nIn Bosnia & Herzegovina, economic growth is expected to be strongly affected by the economic consequences from the Russian war in Ukraine in the mid-term.\n\n\"This combination of shocks is impacting the regions outlook. BiHs tight connection with the region and tighter global financing conditions, as well as expected slowdown in both domestic and external demand, will impact the BiH outlook as well,\" Christopher Sheldon, World Bank country manager for Bosnia and Montenegro, said.\n\nMeanwhile, Montenegro's economy is also affected by the unfavourable global outlook, the World Bank noted.\n\n\"With limited fiscal space, elevated public debt, and increased costs of financing, prudent fiscal management is becoming an imperative for Montenegro. At the same time, the focus should return to structural reforms to boost growth and create new jobs,\" Sheldon noted.\n\nHe added that such reforms would include measures to boost the market competition, remove entry barriers to business, increase retention and reinvestment by foreign investors, reduce barriers to female labor force participation, improve quality of education, and raise standards of governance, including digitalisation.\n\nSimilarly, Albanias GDP growth is expected to decelerate during the remainder of the year, the World Bank said, pointed to the impact of rising inflation on Albanians real disposable income combined with the slowdown in the global economy that is resulting in tighter financing conditions and lower foreign demand.\n\nAlbanias medium-term prospects \"hinge on the global recovery and structural reforms, and on the launch fiscal consolidation,\" the World Bank said.",

                "cc_text": "Its failing to target key players and products most popular with young people\n\nCurrent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight of the vaping industry in the US is likely to have minimal impact, suggests an analysis of the regulators warning letters for marketing violations, published online in the journal Tobacco Control.\n\nThe regulator is failing to target the key players or the products most popular with young people, the analysis suggests, with over 90% of warnings sent to small online retailers rather than leading tobacco companies, and a focus on refillable devices.\n\nWhile the prevalence of vaping among US adults remains low, at just under 4% in 2020, it is four times higher among young people.\n\nIn 2016 the FDA announced plans to regulate the vaping industry, including a requirement for the manufacturers of e-cigarettes to obtain pre-market approval (PMTA) to ensure that their products protect public health.\n\nIn 2017, the regulator began sending warning letters to manufacturers, retailers, and distributors for potential violations, such as advertising to young people, selling to minors, packaging or labelling that contravened regulations, and failure to apply for a PMTA.\n\nBut little is known about who received these letters, the types of product they concerned, or details of the violations and their consequences.\n\nTo try and find out, the authors from non-profit tobacco control organisation, Truth Initiative, assessed the content and recipients of publicly available FDA warning letters issued in 2020 and 2021. In total, the FDA issued 303 warnings:126 in 2020 and 177 up to 9 September 2021.\n\nThe analysis revealed that in 2021, over 98% of all the targeted companies fulfilled all three roles (manufacturer, distributor and retailer).\n\nBut nearly all the letters (97%) were sent to small online retailers, none of which was a large company with measurable market share, as evidenced by sales data.\n\nCompanies were cited for between one and three infractions. Most involved failure to obtain a PMTA. In 2020 and 2021, respectively, 56% and 99%+ of the infractions concerned a PMTA violation.\n\nAnd more than 90% of the products cited880 different ones in totalwere flavoured refillable e-cigarette liquids, rather than the disposable vaping devices (pod mods) which the evidence indicates are most popular with young people.\n\nPenalties ranged in severity from product detention to product seizure and fines. But loss of tobacco distributor licence and criminal charges appeared less frequently in both years than these other consequences.\n\nAt the time of the review, most (72%) of the websites cited for 2020 infractions were still operating, as were 29% of websites cited for 2021 infractions.\n\nAnd as the authors note, it was impossible to find out how the targeted companies responded, and whether the FDA followed through with the consequences cited in the warning letters, because that information isnt publicly available.\n\n\"While current research estimates that online sales comprise around one-third of the marketplace, data tell us that most young people get their products from friends (32.3%), buy them from another person (21.5%), or purchase from a vape shop (22.2%),\" note the authors.\n\n\"Prioritising the products most accessed by youth which are made available from a variety of sources will be important to curb youth use,\" they add.\n\nAnd they emphasise:\"Strong, impactful and transparent consequences need to be in place to prevent the sale of products that violate regulations necessary in protecting the health of adult users of e-cigarettes and preventing youth use alike.\"\n\n\"The FDA should use its enforcement powers to target the manufacturing, distribution, and sellers of the tobacco products that have the greatest impact on youth and products that provide no public health benefit,\" they conclude.\n\nNotes for editors\n\nResearch: Analysis of e-cigarette warning letters issued by the Food and Drug Administration in 2020 and 2021 doi: 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2022-057359\n\nJournal: Tobacco Control\n\nFunding: Truth Initiative\n\nLink to Academy of Medical Sciences press release labelling system\n\nhttps://press.psprings.co.uk/AMSlabels.pdf",

But these studies have tended to be mostly retrospective, to include only a few selected health outcomes, and to have excluded consideration of COVID-19 severity.\n\nTo explore these issues further, the researchers drew on 53,613 UK Biobank participants 17,871 of whom were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between March 2020 and March 2021, and 35,742 of whom werent.\n\nThe COVID-19 cases included more men, less affluence, and poorer cardiometabolic profiles.\n\nThe UK Biobank tracks the health and survival of its participants through medical records and death registration data.\n\nOf the 17,871 COVID-19 cases, 2,701 required hospital admission for their infection; 866 were admitted to hospital for another condition; and 14,304 didnt need hospital treatment.\n\nAll participants were tracked until a cardiovascular problem arose, they died, or until the end of March 2021, providing 141 days of monitoring, on average, but ranging from 32 to 395.\n\nThe cardiovascular outcomes considered included: heart attack; stroke; heart failure; atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat); VTE (blood clot in a vein); pericarditis (inflammation of the heart lining); death from any cause; death from cardiovascular or ischaemic heart disease.\n\nCompared with their matched peers who hadnt caught the virus, those who didnt require hospital admission for COVID-19 infection were nearly 3 times as likely to have a blood clot in a vein (VTE) and more than 10 times as likely to die of any cause.\n\nBut those admitted to hospital because of COVID-19 had higher risks of all the outcomes considered irrespective of potentially influential demographic and cardiometabolic factors.\n\nThey were more than 27 times as likely to develop VTE, more than 21.5 times as likely to be diagnosed with heart failure, and 17.5 times as likely to have a stroke. And the risk of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation was nearly 15 times higher, that of pericarditis nearly 14 times higher, and that of a heart attack nearly 10 times as high.\n\nThe risks of all the outcomes measured among those admitted for other reasons but who had COVID-19 were also higher than those of people who hadnt caught the virus.\n\nBut their risk of death from any cause was lower than those admitted for COVID-19, although their risks of death from cardiovascular or ischaemic heart disease were higher, which likely relates to the original reason for admission rather than COVID-19 itself, suggest the researchers. They also had higher risks of atrial fibrillation and heart attack.\n\nUnsurprisingly, deaths were higher among people with COVID-19 infection: those admitted with the virus as a primary reason were 118 times as likely to die as those who didnt need hospital treatment, while those for whom COVID-19 was a secondary diagnosis were 64 times as likely to die.\n\nMost cardiovascular disease diagnoses, especially atrial fibrillation, VTE, pericarditis, and death from any cause occurred within the first 30 days of infection and among those admitted to hospital for COVID-19 as the primary reason.\n\nBut heightened risk remained beyond 30 days, particularly for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, VTE, pericarditis and all-cause deaths, although to a lesser extent.\n\nThis is an observational study, so no definitive conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. Nor did the analysis consider other potentially influential factors such as the impact of vaccination, new Virus variants, or serial infections.\n\nBut note the researchers:\"The long-term sequelae of past COVID-19 exposure is emerging as a dominant public health concern. Our findings highlight the increased cardiovascular risk of individuals with past infection, which are likely to be greater in countries with limited access to vaccination and thus greater population exposure to COVID-19.\"\n\nBut they add: \"Such risks are almost entirely confined to those with disease requiring hospitalisation and highest in the early (first 30 days) postinfection period.\"\n\nIn a linked editorial, doctors from the Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, UK, consider the therapeutic implications of the findings.\n\n\"The prothrombotic effects of COVID-19 do raise the question of whether antithrombotic strategies are required to prevent this large excess of events,\" they write.\n\n\"Perhaps a broader question is whether antithrombotic therapies should be considered in all individuals, including the initiation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies,\" they add.\n\n\"Clearly, duration of therapy is relevant, and these data do question whether 7 days of prophylactic anticoagulation is sufficient for patients with COVID-19.\"\n\nNotes for editors\n\nResearch: Cardiovascular disease and mortality sequelae of COVID-19 in the UK Biobank doi 10.1136/heartjnl-2022-321492\n\nEditorial: Not to be sneezed at: cardiovascular disease after COVID-19 infection doi 10.1136/heartjnl-2022-321748\n\nJournal: Heart\n\nFunding: None declared\n\nLink to Academy of Medical Sciences press release labelling system\n\nhttps://press.psprings.co.uk/AMSlabels.pdf\n\nExternally peer reviewed?

Russia accused Ukraine of sending the drones, but Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the strike.\n\nThe coordinated attack, which mixed both armed aerial drones and uncrewed surface vessels loaded with explosives, damaged at least one Russian ship at the strategically important port, which is home to the Russian navys Black Seat Fleet, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense.\n\nThe sudden early morning attack saw the drones swarm in on the Russian ships, attacking from multiple vectors. The multi-pronged drone assault used at least nine aerial drones and seven drone boats, all loaded with explosives, the Russian Ministry of Defense said, according to the Russian news organization TASS.\n\n\"All air targets were destroyed,\" the statement said.\n\nFootage that surfaced on social media Saturday morning appears to show the attack from the perspective of the drone boats as they skim along the water, in some cases taking fire from Russian helicopters as they swiftly move toward their targets.\n\nFootage of the attack was captured by the drones and CCTV cameras in the harbor.\n\nUnbelievable footage from one of the marine drones used in the attack on Russias Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol.\n\n(Via Ukrainian journalist Andriy Tsaplienko)\n\nFull story: https://t.co/YdtcFELiSy pic.twitter.com/Nw5YbHeQMU James Waterhouse (@JamWaterhouse) October 29, 2022\n\n#Ukraine: Remarkable video of today's attack on the Russian Sevastopol Naval Base.\n\nUkrainian Uncrewed Surface Vessels (Drone boats filled with explosives) apparently managed to hit a Project 11356R frigate (presumably Admiral Makarov) & the Ivan Golubets Project 266M minesweeper. pic.twitter.com/6nJVkwvgKW Ukraine Weapons Tracker (@UAWeapons) October 29, 2022\n\nIts unclear exactly how much damage was dealt to Russian ships at Sevastopol, but multiple vessels were in the port at the time of the attack. According to the Russian MoD, at least one vessel sustained minor damage.\n\nThe water-borne drones themselves appear to be a same kind of watercraft as the mysterious single-engine boat that was previously spotted near the city In September, which our colleagues at The War Zone reported was likely a \"suicide drone\" loaded with explosives and meant to detonate on impact.\n\nRussia also accused British \"specialists\" of helping coordinate the attack but did not offer any evidence. The British government denied any involvement, accusing the Russian government of \"peddling false claims of an epic scale.\"\n\nThe Governor of Russian-occupied Sevastopol claimed that Russian forces repelled a UAV attack starting this morning, which included an unmanned naval system. https://t.co/GKA5p3fKWghttps://t.co/6ZxyKM4hXw pic.twitter.com/UCqUnHakx1 Rob Lee (@RALee85) October 29, 2022\n\nThe drone swarm constituted the \"most massive attack by UAVs and remote-controlled surface drones in the waters of the Sevastopol Bay in the history [of the special military operation],\" the governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, said in a statement to TASS.\n\nSubscribe to Task & Purpose Today.

The Yankees acquired outfielder Harrison Bader and a player to be named later or cash considerations, from the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for Jordan Montgomery.\n\nShocking New York Yankees Trade Brings Hudson Valley Resident 'Home'\n\nKansas City Royals v New York Yankees Getty Images loading...\n\nThe lefty starting pitcher was a homegrown Yankee. Many Yankee fans were shocked the club traded a homegrown, reliable, starting pitcher for the injured Cardinals outfielder. At the time of the trade, Bader was on the injured list with plantar fasciitis, in a walking boot.\n\nMaking the trader appear worse was the fact that Montgomery get off to a great start in St. Louis while Bader recovered from his injury.\n\nBader is from Westchester County, New York. Bader was born in Bronxville, New York, and grew up in the Town of Eastchester. Hader grew up a fan of the New York Yankees while playing Little League in Westchester County.\n\nAt the time of the trade, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said the team was confident the speedy centerfielder with elite defensive skills would be available sometime in late September and in the postseason. Hader, 28, is also under contract for next season. He won a Gold Glove last year.\n\nFor all the news that the Hudson Valley is sharing make sure to follow Hudson Valley Post on Facebook, download the Hudson Valley Post Mobile App and sign up for the Hudson Valley Post Newsletter.\n\nHudson Valley Man Now Beloved By New York Yankee Fans\n\nPittsburgh Pirates v St. Louis Cardinals Getty Images loading...\n\nOnce Bader got off the injured list fans quickly saw why the Hudson Valley native was targeted by the New York Yankees.

                "cc_text": "Findings show small increased risk after adenovirus vaccines\n\nShould be considered when planning further immunisation campaigns and future vaccine development\n\nA study published by The BMJ today sheds further light on the risk of developing a very rare blood-clotting condition known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after vaccination against the covid-19 virus.\n\nBased on health data from five European countries and the US, it shows a small increased risk of TTS after a first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and a trend towards an increased risk after the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine, compared with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\n\nThe researchers stress that this syndrome is very rare, but say these observed risks \"should be considered when planning further immunisation campaigns and future vaccine development.\"\n\nTTS occurs when a person has blood clots (thrombosis) as well as low blood platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). Its very rare and different from general clotting conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or lung clots (pulmonary embolism).\n\nTTS is currently being investigated as a rare side effect of adenovirus based covid-19 vaccines, which use a weakened virus to trigger an immune response against coronavirus, but no clear evidence exists on the comparative safety of different types of vaccines.\n\nTo address this knowledge gap, an international team of researchers set out to compare the risk of TTS or thromboembolic events associated with use of adenovirus based covid-19 vaccines with mRNA based covid-19 vaccines.\n\nTheir findings are based on routinely collected health data for over 10 million adults in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the US who received at least one dose of a covid-19 vaccine (Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) from December 2020 to mid-2021.\n\nTo minimise possible error, participants were matched by age and sex and a range of other potentially influential factors such as pre-existing conditions and medication use were taken into account.\n\nThe researchers then compared rates of thrombosis and of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia between the adenovirus vaccines (Oxford-AstraZeneca or Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) and the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) within 28 days after vaccination.\n\nOverall, 1.3 million first dose Oxford-AstraZeneca recipients were matched to 2.1 million Pfizer-BioNTech recipients from Germany and the UK.\n\nAn additional, 762,517 people receiving Janssen/Johnson & Johnson were matched to 2.8 million receiving Pfizer-BioNTech in Germany, Spain, and the US, and all 628,164 Janssen/Johnson & Johnson recipients from the US were matched to 2.2 million Moderna recipients.\n\nA total of 862 thrombocytopenia events were found in the matched first dose Oxford-AstraZeneca recipients from Germany and the UK, and 520 events after a first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\nWhen the data were pooled together, analysis showed a 30% increased risk of thrombocytopenia after a first dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca compared with Pfizer-BioNTech an absolute risk difference of 8.21 per 100,000 recipients.\n\nAn increase in risk, albeit not statistically significant, of venous thrombosis with thrombocytopenia was observed after a first vaccine dose of Janssen/Johnson & Johnson compared with Pfizer-BioNTech. But the researchers say this finding needs to be replicated in other studies before any firm conclusions can be drawn.\n\nNo differential risk of thrombocytopenia was seen after a second dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca compared with a second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech. Similarly, no increased risk of thrombocytopenia was noted after Janssen/Johnson & Johnson compared with a first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\nThis is an observational study, and the researchers acknowledge that the rarity of the condition and incomplete vaccine records may have affected the results. Whats more, they cant rule out the possibility that some of the observed risk may have been due to other unmeasured (confounding) factors.\n\nHowever, this was a well-designed study that allowed comparison of available vaccines with each other, rather than with no vaccination, and the results were consistent after additional analyses, suggesting that they withstand scrutiny.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first multinational analysis of the comparative safety of adenovirus based compared with mRNA based covid-19 vaccines,\" say the authors.\n\n\"Although these events are very rare, absolute numbers of affected patients could become substantial owing to the large numbers of vaccine doses administered worldwide,\" they warn.\n\nAs such, they suggest that the observed risks after adenovirus based vaccines \"should be considered when planning further immunisation campaigns and future vaccine development.\"\n\n[Ends]\n\nNotes for editors\n\nResearch: Comparative risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or thromboembolic events associated with different covid-19 vaccines: international network cohort study from five European countries and the US doi: 10.1136/bmj-2022-071594\n\nJournal: The BMJ\n\nFunding: European Medicines Agency\n\nLink to Academy of Medical Sciences press release labelling system:\n\nhttps://press.psprings.co.uk/AMSlabels.pdf\n\nExternally peer reviewed?

Aside from the immense suffering caused by Russias aggression in Ukraine, the war is also having major repercussions around the world, especially on food security, Statista said in a note.\n\nThe head of the United Nations World Food Programme, David Beasly, recently warned that the war was creating a food crisis \"beyond anything weve seen since World War II\", leading to surging food prices and possibly shortages in many countries that rely on exports from Russia or Ukraine.\n\nAs the following chart, based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), shows, Ukraine and Russia are major producers of wheat, barley and maize, accounting for an average (combined) share of 27%, 23% and 15% of global exports between 2016 and 2020 respectively. Even the World Food Programme itself gets 50% of its grain supplies from the Ukraine-Russia area and is now facing dramatic cost increases in its efforts to combat food emergencies around the world.\n\n\"This is a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe,\" WFP director Beasley said, referring to the devastating effect the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had on world hunger. According to the UN organisation, the number of people facing acute food insecurity had jumped from 135mn to 276mn since 2019 and thats not even taking the conflict in Ukraine into account. In total, more than 800mn face hunger around the world, while 44mn people in 38 countries are teetering on the edge of famine, according to WFP.\n\nThe war in Ukraine is endangering crucial wheat supplies in many of the least developed countries in the world. Among them, countries in Africa and the Middle East in particular are heavily dependent on wheat imports from Russia and Ukraine. According to the UN Comtrade database, Benin and Somalia used to obtain all of their wheat from Ukraine and/or Russia. The dependency of Egypt stood at 82%, according to the data.\n\nWhile crop failures are to be expected in Ukraine in 2022, Russia imposed an export ban on products such as wheat until the end of June 2022, leading observers to predict shortages and rising prices among their trade partners and on the world market. Egypt and Somalia are among the countries where wheat is traditionally used in some of the most common food staples. According to The Guardian, a food shortage had already been looming in the latter country because of a resurgence of conflict and drought, causing international organisations to warn of the risk of severe hunger even before the invasion.\n\nUkraine and Russia are also among the worlds top exporters of other important food staples. Around two thirds of the global exports of crucial sunflower products like oil and feed come from Ukraine and Russia.\n\nYou will find more infographics at Statista",

It said one vessel had received minor damage.\n\nHours later, a statement by the foreign ministry in Moscow said: \"The Russian side cannot guarantee the safety of civilian dry cargo ships participating in the 'Black Sea Initiative', and suspends its implementation from today for an indefinite period.\"\n\nIt said the move was \"in connection with the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces, which were led by British specialists\" and that these actions \"were directed... against Russian ships that ensured the functioning of the said humanitarian corridor\".\n\nMoscow claimed 16 aerial and maritime drones were destroyed, and that only a minesweeper had sustained damage.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether that is indeed the case, with reports suggesting that the flagship frigate was also hit. Claims and counterclaims have become part of this war.\n\nPresident Zelensky said Russia's decision was not one that had been made today, but in September \"when it blocked the movement of ships with our food produce\".\n\n\"Why is it that some handful of individuals somewhere in the Kremlin can decide whether there will be food on the tables of people in Egypt or in Bangladesh?\" he added.\n\nMr Zelensky said a strong international response was needed from both the UN and the world's twenty largest economies.\n\nThe White House said Russia was \"weaponising food\".\n\nA UN spokesman said the organisation, which brokered the deal with Turkey, was in touch with Moscow.\n\nIt added that it was \"vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative\", which it said was a critical humanitarian effort improving access to food for millions of people around the world.\n\nThe agreement allowed Ukraine to resume its Black Sea grain exports, which had been blocked when Russia invaded the country.\n\nIt was personally negotiated by the UN secretary general and celebrated as a major diplomatic victory that helped ease a global food crisis.\n\nBut Russia has complained that its own exports are still hindered, and had previously suggested it might not renew the deal.\n\nReuters\n\nThe Russian Navy at the entrance to the port city of Sevastopol in 2014\n\nIn recent days, Kyiv has accused Moscow of deliberately delaying the passage of ships, creating a queue of more than 170 vessels.\n\nSaturday's drone attack comes as Ukrainian troops successfully retake territory occupied by Russian troops since they launched their invasion on 24 February.\n\nRussia has responded by launching large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly on the country's energy grid.\n\nCrimea was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and is extremely symbolic for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn recent weeks, several attacks have hit the peninsula, where the Russian army has built up a large presence.\n\nSevastopol is the largest city in the region and home to Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-installed governor of the city, said Russia's navy had repelled the latest attack - the \"most massive\" on the city since February.\n\nHe said that all unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) had been shot down and no civilian infrastructure had been damaged.\n\nThe Ukrainian government rarely comments on claims made by Russian authorities in Crimea, although senior officials often celebrate incidents on the peninsula.\n\nUkraine has vowed to recapture all territory that is under Russian occupation, including Crimea, which has been a key base for President Putin's forces during the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWithout providing any evidence, the Russian defence ministry also accused British navy specialists of helping Ukrainian forces prepare the attack on Saturday morning.\n\nIt also said the same unit was \"involved in plotting, organising, and implementation of the terrorist attack in the Baltic Sea on 26 September this year to blow up the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines\".\n\nIn its reply, the MoD said: \"To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.\n\n\"This invented story, says more about arguments going on inside the Russian government than it does about the west.\"\n\nFrance also said it did not believe the Russian allegations.\n\nIn recent days, Russia has been engaged in what US and Ukrainian officials describe as a disinformation campaign, with unsubstantiated claims that Kyiv is preparing to use a radioactive dirty bomb, or even biological mosquitoes.\n\nRussia's Black Sea Fleet was previously targeted in April this year by Ukrainian forces when its flagship warship, the Moskva, was sunk. The 510-crew missile cruiser had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, and its sinking was a major symbolic and military blow.\n\nEarlier this month, a blast occurred on the Crimean bridge - a pivotal symbol of Russia's annexation of Crimea.",

                "cc_text": "This ground-breaking method reduced cultivation expenses and conserved rainwater while sustainably increasing productivity for dietary security and economic prosperity\n\nIndia is the top producer of millets worldwide. Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), locally called Bajra, accounts for two-thirds of the total millet produced in the country. In the dry regions of arid and semi-arid climates, the dual-purpose crop pearl millet is produced for cereals as well as green/dry livestock fodder. Pearl millet is increasingly promoted as a nutritious cereal grain for rural communities with limited resources. Fortunately, the farmers in these regions use animal-based farming systems, feeding the livestock straw produced from pearl millet. It was cultivated using traditional methods in undulated fields in rainfed regions. The situation resulted in low productivity and profitability along with rainwater erosion during the rainy season.\n\nIn marginal areas with low inputs, the pearl millet crop is primarily grown during the rainy season under which effective weed management is a considerable difficulty. There has been a need for a system for managing weeds that is both ecologically sound and energy-efficient, along with rainwater harvesting. In pearl millet, herbicides are also useful for controlling weeds. However, the quality of the grain, fodder, soil, and ecosystem has been diminished by the direct and indirect effects of herbicide on the soil. Farmers worry that applying herbicides may compromise the quality of the animal feed and the health of the animals since this crop serves as a substantial source of animal fodder.\n\nYou may also like to read: How homestead hatchery-based Bengal catfish seed production brings a viable livelihood model for landless farm women\n\nPearl millets biophysical and economic sustainability must be increased by boosting rainwater conservation and efficient usage as well as by lowering cultivation expenses and energy-intensive processes. In the Chambal division of Madhya Pradesh, the current study was carried out as part of the Farmer First Programme (FFP) project on rainfall conservation as well as weed control using laser-assisted field levelling and ridge furrow technology of pearl millet.\n\nThe advantages of using a laser levelling method and a tractor-operated ridge furrow at 40 cm intervals 25 days after sowing for weed control over the conventional levelling technique and chemical weed control (use of 2, 4-D @1.0 kg/ha application at 20 days after sowing or 10 to 30 cm tall plant) that farmers have been using since 2017 in 20 farmers fields in adopted villages. After the first monsoon rains, pearl millet (var.-hybrid) was sowed in the first to second week of July. For pearl millet, the seed rate was 4 to 5 kg per hectare.\n\nThe agronomical practice packages recommended by the Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya (RVSKVV), Gwalior, were applied during the programme. Due to timely rains at crucial periods of pearl millet development, the crop was matured using rainwater. At the maturity stage, yields of grain and straw were recorded along with yield-attributing characteristics of crops. At the mature stage, weed biomass and density were assessed in each plot.\n\nYou may also like to read: IRRI scientists demonstrate rice varieties to fight abiotic stresses and hidden hunger\n\nWhen compared to current farmers practises (FP), the revolutionary dual-purpose technique for weed control and rainwater conservation in rainy season crops of pearl millet with ridge furrow spacing was at 40 cm. In comparison to FP, the ridge furrow at 40 cm increased grain yield by 18 per cent, net returns from an additional INR 13,095 per hectare, total water use by 37 mm per hectare and water productivity by 33.1 per cent.\n\nThroughout all of the chosen villages, the proportionate impact of new, enhanced technology was embraced, and now pearl millet cultivation is practiced across Chambal region in Madhya Pradesh. The overall findings support the use of ridge furrow spacing of 40 cm at 25 days after sowing in standing pearl millet crops during the rainy season to increase yield, net returns, and water productivity. This ground-breaking method reduced cultivation expenses and conserved rainwater while sustainably increasing productivity for dietary security and economic prosperity.\n\n(Source: ICAR-FFP project of Directorate of Extension Education, RVSKVV)\n\nClick here to read Agri Research stories.\n\nEngage with us on Telegram, Twitter, Linkedin and Facebook.",

While the situation in the US is very serious and deteriorating, they point out that intimate partner violence is a leading cause of homicide for women globally.\n\nEnding male violence, including gun violence, is therefore an urgent priority for the health and safety of women everywhere, they conclude.\n\n[Ends]\n\nNotes for editors\n\nEditorial: Homicide is a leading cause of death for pregnant women in the US doi: 10.1136/bmj.o2499\n\nJournal: The BMJ\n\nLink to Academy of Medical Sciences press release labelling system:\n\nhttps://press.psprings.co.uk/AMSlabels.pdf\n\nExternally peer reviewed?

In a video address, he said that Russias actions mean that Ukraine has delivered three million tonnes less grain than planned.\n\nThe UK, France and Germany called for a UN investigation into accusations that Russia is using Iranian drones in Ukraine. If found to be true, the allegations would be in breach of UN security council resolution (UNSCR) 2231. A letter, seen by Reuters, was circulated to UN security council members by the three countries, known as the E3.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen said Ukraine will need Europes support \"for as long as it takes\". The president of the EU Commission made the comments at the European Council in Brussels.\n\nRussia claims it has destroyed a depot with foreign-made Ukrainian military equipment in the Kherson region. The agency was not able to immediately verify the report.\n\nUkraines president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of planning to destroy a hydroelectric dam in the eastern Kherson region, where Ukrainian soldiers have been steadily advancing and Moscow-installed authorities have begun what they call evacuations of civilians. Late on Thursday Zelenskiy accused Moscow of planting mines at a the dam in the Russian-occupied region, posing a threat to a 400km Soviet-built long canal network. A Russian-appointed official in occupied Kherson has denied the allegations. Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidents office, claimed that Russia has resorted to the tactic because \"nuclear blackmail did not work. They wont break us. We will hit back even harder.\"\n\nA Russian-appointed official in occupied Kherson has denied allegations by Kyiv that Russia has started mining a hydroelectric dam in the region. Citing state-owned news agency RIA, Reuters reported that Kirill Stremousov denied suggestions by the Ukrainian president that Russia is planning to blow up Kakhovska HPP and that claims that it had started mining the dam were \"false\".\n\nRussia has hit at least half of Ukraines thermal generation capacity since 10 October, but not all stricken power units have stopped working completely, Ukraines energy minister said on Friday. Herman Halushchenko said that 30-40% of overall national power infrastructure had been hit in attacks intended to destroy Ukraines energy system a goal he said had not been achieved.\n\nRussias defence ministry said Friday a telephone conversation has taken place between the defence minister Sergei Shoigu, and his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin. The statement says \"Topical issues of international security, including the situation in Ukraine, were discussed.\" A readout later published by the Pentagon said that Austin \"emphasised the importance of maintaining lines of communication\".\n\nThe Pentagon also confirmed a call between the US defence secretary and the Ukrainian defence minister, in which Austin pledged \"unwavering US commitment\" to supporting Ukraine against Russia.\n\nSix people have been injured Friday morning in a Russian strike at \"an object of industrial infrastructure\" in the city of Kharkiv, according to a Telegram post by the regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov. A series of explosions have also been reported in Ukraines south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, and no casualties were reported after strikes on the coast of the Kutsurub community in Mykolaiv region.\n\nMoscow-installed authorities in Ukraines occupied southern Kherson region said on Friday that Ukrainian armed forces killed four people when they shelled the Antonivskiy Bridge over the Dnipro River.\n\nAuthorities in the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic, one of the occupied areas of Ukraine which Russia has claimed to annex, have reported that a man has been killed in the Kirovsky district of Donetsk by shelling from Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence has claimed Russia orchestrated a distraction campaign by announcing that 70,000 Belarusian troops would be involved in a new Russian-Belarussian group of forces. It is unlikely that Russia has actually deployed a significant number of extra troops into Belarus and the announcement is likely an attempt to convince Ukraine to divert forces to guard the northern border, according to British intelligence.\n\nA Russian court has ordered the arrest of television journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, local media reports. Ovsyannikova was under house arrest and has already fled Russia, her lawyer said this week.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdoan, president of Turkey, has said he will meet Swedens new prime minister Ulf Kristersson over Swedens bid to join Nato, which Turkey has opposed. Erdoan also said he sees no obstacles to extending the UN-brokered deal allowing Ukrainian Black Sea grain exports.\n\nFinlands foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, has said the country is still in regular contact with Turkey in relation to its Nato membership bid.\n\nThe European Union must remain united in its support for Ukraine and should start working on holding Russia legally accountable for its activities in the war, the Latvian prime minister, Krijnis Kari, said on his way to the second day of an EU summit. His Estonian counterpart, Kaja Kallas, echoed his words, saying \"We definitely have to discuss the legal response to the crimes of aggression that have been committed in Ukraine. That can only be addressed by a separate tribunal.\"\n\nFrance will invite the leader of Moldova to Paris in November to express Frances solidarity for the country in the context of Russias invasion of Ukraine, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said at an EU meeting.\n\nIran deepened its involvement in Russias invasion of Ukraine by providing technical support for Russian pilots flying Iranian-made drones to bomb civilian targets, the White House confirmed. The US national security councils John Kirby said on Thursday that it was the USs understanding that the Iranian advisers were in Crimea to provide training and maintenance but not to actually pilot the drones after Russian forces experienced difficulties in operating the unmanned flying bombs.\n\nIrans foreign ministry advised its citizens on Friday to refrain from traveling to Ukraine and asked Iranians there to leave the country.\n\nUkrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has spoken to Israeli prime minister Yair Lapid and discussed in detail Kyivs request for air and missile defence systems and technology.\n\nThe UK is implementing new sanctions on three Iranian individuals and a business responsible for supplying Russia with drones used to bombard Ukraine. By supplying these drones Iran is \"actively warmongering, profiting off Russias abhorrent attacks on Ukrainian citizens, and adding to the suffering of the people and the destruction of critical infrastructure\", a foreign office statement said. The assets of all four have been frozen and the individuals are also subject to travel bans.\n\nPrior to the UKs announcement, the EU agreed sanctions against the same business and three individuals. Tehran denies supplying the drones to Moscow, while the Kremlin said the west is seeking to put \"pressure\" on Iran with accusations that Moscow is using drones made in the country.\n\nUkraine began restricting electricity supplies across the country starting from 7am on Thursday in response to Russias strikes against its energy infrastructure. A barrage of more than 300 attacks have destroyed a third of all power plants across the country, President Zelenskiy said. Ukrainians will now need to prepare for \"rolling blackouts\" and people will have to conserve energy, the deputy head of the presidents office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, warned.\n\nA Russian air strike that hit a major thermal power station in the city of Burshtyn in western Ukraine on Wednesday has caused \"quite serious\" damage, the regions governor said on Thursday.\n\nA Russian aircraft released a missile near a British plane patrolling in international airspace over the Black Sea on 29 September, the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, revealed. He told the House of Commons that the Russians blamed the incident on a \"technical malfunction\".\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Thursday that Putin was using energy and hunger as weapons but has failed to break the wests unity and will not achieve his war aims through scorched earth tactics. \"We will not let Moscows latest escalation go unanswered. Scorched earth tactics will not help Russia win the war. They will only strengthen the unity and resolve of Ukraine and its partners,\" Scholz told the German parliament.",

Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times\n\nKYIV, Ukraine Noisy and slow-flying, the drones buzzed over the city, eerily announcing their arrival with a hum that sounded like a moped. The first explosions rang out shortly before 7 a.m., as residents of Kyiv were preparing for work and children were just waking up.\n\nBy the time the attack was over, at least four people were killed in a capital at once defiant and buffeted by fear.\n\nIn strikes early in the war and last week, destruction arrived in Kyiv as a bolt from the blue, with missiles streaking in at tremendous speeds. Mondays drone attack was different, with residents aware of the drones overhead, seeking their targets.\n\nThe strikes highlighted Russias growing use of Iranian-made drones, which explode on impact and are easier to shoot down, as Western analysts say Moscows stocks of precision missiles are running low. While Iran has officially denied supplying Russia with drones for use in Ukraine, U.S. officials said that the first batch of such weapons was delivered in August.\n\nDrones flew low over office buildings and apartment blocks in the center of Kyiv, visible from the streets below and adding a frisson of terror. Soldiers at checkpoints or other positions in the city opened fire with their rifles.\n\nAmong the dead were a young couple, including a woman who was six months pregnant, pulled from the wreckage of a residential building, according to the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko.\n\nAfter nightfall, air raid sirens rang out again in Kyiv and beyond, as Ukrainian officials said air-defense systems were targeting Russian drones once more. The Ukrainian Armed Forces air command said in an update late Monday night that it had shot down eight drones and two missiles.\n\nThe strikes on Monday were just the latest to target the capital, a little over a week after Kyiv came under sustained attack from Russian missiles.\n\nYulia Oleksandrivna, 86, huddled in a basement with her young grandson on Monday morning. She said anger was too soft a word to describe how she was feeling. A retired professor, she had lived through World War II, fleeing her birthplace in Russia with her family when she was 5 and a half years old.\n\n\"The sound of the sirens that we have these days, I know this sound from my childhood,\" she said. \"At the start and at the end of my life, this is the music of my life.\"\n\nAt least two more blasts hit at about 8:15 a.m. Thick white smoke blanketed parts of central Kyiv along with an acrid burning smell. The city stayed under an air raid alert for nearly three hours.\n\nImage Mayor Vitali Klitschko of Kyiv at one of the sites hit on Monday morning. Credit... Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times\n\n\"I was smoking on my balcony, and one flew by,\" said Vladislav Khokhlov, a cosmetologist who lives in a 13th-floor apartment. He said he saw what looked like a small metallic triangle buzz past not much higher than the rooftops, sounding like a chain saw.\n\nOne explosion hit a residential building. Shortly after emergency workers recovered a body from the rubble, the mayor of Kyiv stood before the damaged four-story block.\n\n\"This is the true face of this war,\" Mr. Klitschko said.\n\nSteps away, the body of a woman lay in a half-unzipped black body bag. An investigator held her thin wrist, covered in dirt and debris, and then folded her arms across her body.\n\nIn one area of central Kyiv, plumes of smoke from fires rose from both sides of a street. \"What a horror,\" said Anna Chugai, a retiree.\n\n\"Again! This is now happening all the time,\" she said.\n\nImage Anna Chugai watching emergency personnel work at the site of a drone attack. Credit... Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times\n\nOne apparent target of the strikes, a municipal heating station, appeared undamaged. Soldiers had opened fire with their rifles when the drones drew near, said Viktor Turbayev, a building manager for a department store a block away.\n\n\"They want us to freeze,\" he said of the Russians continued attacks against electricity, heating and other key services.\n\nBelow ground, a hushed community of families formed in the safety of subway stations, in scenes recalling the early days of Russias invasion in February. Mothers sat with children, playing cards. Some women lay infants to sleep on mats. For a time passing trains would wake the children and they would cry, until they fell so deeply asleep that the sound no longer bothered them.\n\nAnastasia Havryliuk, 34, said she takes her daughter to work most days now, so they can dash together to a bomb shelter if the air raid sirens blare.\n\n\"I cant imagine her being without me in the bomb shelter,\" she said.",

REUTERS/Igor Tkachenko/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nOct 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine said seven vessels sailed off from its ports on Sunday carrying grain bound for Asia and Europe, but accused Russia of blocking the full implementation of Black Sea grain deal.\n\n\"Russia is deliberately blocking the full realisation of the Grain Initiative. As a result, these (Ukrainian) ports in the last few days are working only at 25-30 percent of their capacity,\" Ukraine's Infrastructure Ministry said in a statement via the Telegram messaging app.\n\nThe agreement, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July, paved the way for Ukraine to resume grain exports from Black Sea ports that had been shut since Russia invaded. Moscow won guarantees for its own grain and fertiliser exports.\n\nUkraine called for the renewal of the deal but concerns over whether Russia will agree to an extension beyond the Nov. 19 deadline has intensified after Russia has repeatedly raised complaints about its implementation.\n\nGennady Gatilov, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, last week told Reuters that Moscow had delivered a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres setting out a list of complaints. [\n\nAmong the ships that departed on Sunday included one chartered by the U.N. World Food Programme, carrying 40,000 tonnes of wheat from Chornomorsk and bound for Yemen, a development welcomed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\n\"It is very important that today the sixth vessel sailed from our port with foodstuffs chartered in the context of the U.N.'s World Food Programme,\" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.\n\n\"This ship is bound for Yemen with wheat. Ethiopia, Yemen and Afghanistan -- these three countries have already received foodstuffs thanks to our exports and the U.N.'s food programme.\"\n\nThe seven ships carrying a total of 124,300 tonnes of foodstuffs left from ports of Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdennyi, according to the Infrastructure Ministry.\n\nSince Aug. 1, the grain deal struck in Istanbul has resulted in 380 vessels carrying 8.5 million tonnes of foodstuffs from Ukraine's Black Sea ports to countries in Africa, Asia and Europe, the ministry added.\n\nTrade specialists have also raised concerns about the wait time for vessels due to reduced numbers of inspections -- considerably less than the 12 supposed to be conducted each day.\n\n\"The grain corridor is at least working, but it is very unstable,\" Andriy But, head of the grain trading firm Agrotrade, told the publication UkrAgroConsult on Friday.\n\nThe deal eased a world food crisis, but as more shippers have joined, the handful of inspection teams has fallen behind.\n\nReporting by Ronald Popeski and Humeyra Pamuk; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Diane Craft\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Lukashenko didnt provide any evidence to back up his claim.\n\nMoscow has used Belarus as a staging ground for its full-scale invasion and regular rocket attacks, but Belarusian troops have not been directly involved in Russias war effort in Ukraine.\n\nLukashenkos statements stoked fears that the joint force would attack Ukraine from the north, aiming to disrupt corridors used to transport Western-supplied weapons across the country.\n\nBelarusian military officials, however, insisted that the force was being created for defensive purposes only.\n\nAs Russian soldiers were deploying in Belarus, Belarusian authorities arrested at least four activists they accused of plotting terrorist attacks to sabotage the operation.\n\n11:50 a.m.:\n\n11:35 a.m.: The United States and Britain will further their cooperation on sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine as well as on other targets, top financial officials for the two allied nations said in a joint statement on Monday, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Over time, we expect to realize the benefits of our collaboration not only in relation to the sanctions imposed in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine, but also across other common sanctions regimes,\" Andrea Gacki, the head of the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, and Giles Thomson, the head of Britain's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, wrote.\n\n11:20 a.m.:\n\n11:05 a.m.: A top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is blaming Iran for the death of Ukrainians in Russian drone strikes, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMikhailo Podolyak also warned that sanctions may not be enough to deter Tehran from supplying Moscows forces with the deadly suicide drones that killed at least four civilians in Kyiv on Monday.\n\n\"A country that oppresses its own people is now giving (Russian) monsters weapons for mass murders in the heart of Europe,\" Mikhailo Podolyak tweeted.\n\nHe said there could be no \"concessions to totalitarianism.\"\n\nPodolyak also called for the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations to expel Russia from the organization.\n\n10:55 a.m.:\n\n10:40 a.m.: European Union countries generally agree that sanctions should be imposed on Iran if investigation proves the country provided Russia with drones used in attacks in Ukraine, the Polish foreign minister said on Monday after meeting his counterparts in Brussels, according to Reuters.\n\nEarlier Monday, the EUs top diplomat said the bloc is seeking concrete evidence for any Iranian involvement in Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\n\"We will look for concrete evidence about the participation (of Iran in the Ukraine war),\" Josep Borrell told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, adding Ukraine's Dmytro Kuleba would take part in the gathering.\n\nUkraine has reported a spate of Russian attacks with Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in recent weeks. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin has not commented.\n\n10:25 a.m.:\n\n10:10 a.m.: Elena Mazur rushed to the blast site of a Russian drone attack in Kyiv on Monday when she received a phone call from her mother saying she was trapped under the wreckage of a residential building, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Please find someone to help me urgently! I'm buried under the rubble,\" Mazur, 52, cited her mother as saying as Mazur later stood near a ruined building where rescuers were digging.\n\nShe was still looking for her mother.\n\n\"We asked, we were told someone was taken to hospital, it might have been her but we do not know. She is not picking up the phone,\" Mazur said.\n\nHours earlier, residents of several Ukrainian cities had scrambled for cover for the second time in a week as Russia launched attacks with drones and missiles, striking residential areas and energy infrastructure.\n\nFour people, including a woman who was six months pregnant and her partner, were killed when a \"kamikaze\" drone hit a block of flats on the edge of Kyiv's central Shevchenkivskyi district, the city mayor said.\n\n9:50 a.m.:\n\n9:35 a.m.: Ukraines capital is reeling from a Russian barrage of suicide drones packed with explosives, which killed at least three people, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe blasts set fire to Kyiv buildings and sent people scurrying to air raid shelters. Some tried to shoot down the kamikazes.\n\nOne of the drones slammed into a residential building, killing three people, according to the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidents office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko.\n\nEnergy facilities were also targeted as Moscow tries to disrupt Ukraines heating supply as winter approaches.\n\nThe Russian military said they used \"long-range air and sea-based high precision weapons\" to strike Ukraines military and energy facilities.\n\nThe attack came a week after Russia unleashed its most widespread strikes against the country in months and as Moscow struggles to halt a Ukrainian battlefield counteroffensive.\n\nKyivs daily life soon resumed in a city that has become grimly accustomed to attacks.\n\n9:25 a.m.:\n\n9:10 a.m.: President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has set Russia on a path towards turmoil that could unseat the Kremlin chief, trigger civil war or even break the country apart, said a Russian diplomat who resigned over the war, Reuters reported.\n\nBoris Bondarev, a counsellor at Russia's permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva, resigned in May because he felt the war had shown just how repressive and warped his homeland had become.\n\nIn a 6,500 word critique of Putin's Russia, Bondarev said the state was infested by sycophantic \"yes men\" who repeated the Kremlin's line, allowing Putin to make crucial decisions in an echo chamber of his own propaganda.\n\nThe future could be laced with chaos, he said.\n\n\"If Putin is kicked out of office, Russias future will be deeply uncertain,\" Bondarev, who worked at the foreign ministry from 2002 to 2022, said in an essay in Foreign Affairs.\n\n8:50 a.m.:\n\n8:40 a.m.: The European Union on Monday approved a military training mission in Europe for thousands of Ukrainian troops and a plan to provide around 500 million euros ($486 million) in extra funds to help buy weapons for the war-torn country, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe mission, which will have a headquarters in Brussels and be under the command of French naval officer Vice Adm. Herve Blejean, will initially run for two years with a budget of almost 107 million euros ($104 million).\n\nEU headquarters said in a statement that the missions aim is to allow the Ukrainian armed forces to \"effectively conduct military operations,\" so that Ukraine can \"defend its territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, effectively exercise its sovereignty and protect civilians.\"\n\nIt said that the EU will provide \"individual, collective and specialized training.\" Countries that arent part of the bloc will be allowed to take part in the training effort. The aim initially is to train about 15,000 Ukrainian troops, chiefly in Poland and Germany.\n\nIts hoped that the mission will be up and running by mid-November.\n\nSeveral EU and NATO nations are already training Ukraines armed forces on a bilateral basis. Asked what added value the Brussels-headquartered mission would bring, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Monday that hes \"strongly convinced that putting together the capacities of the European armies we can offer a much better product.\"\n\n8:20 a.m.: Tajik authorities are investigating media reports that say at least two Tajik nationals were involved in a shooting spree at a military training base in Russia over the weekend that left at least 11 Russian men dead and at least 15 wounded, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nThe Tajik Interior Ministry told RFE/RL in a written statement on October 17 that \"Tajikistan's embassy in Moscow is trying to clarify whether or not Tajik citizens were involved in the deadly shooting.\"\n\nMeanwhile, relatives of a 24-year-old Tajik man, Ehson Aminzoda, told RFE/RL that Russian authorities had identified him as one of the men who opened fire on October 15 during military training near the Russian city of Belgorod, near the border with Ukraine.\n\nEhson Aminzoda's older brother, Firuz, who resides and works in Moscow, told RFE/RL on October 17 that Russian authorities had informed him that his brother was identified as one of the shooters.\n\n8:05 a.m.:\n\n7:50 a.m.: The U.S. embassy in Kyiv condemned Russian attacks on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities on Monday and said the United States stood with the Ukrainian people, Reuters reported.\n\n\"More desperate and reprehensible Russian attacks this morning against civilians and civilian infrastructure. We admire the strength and resilience of the Ukrainian people. We will stand with you for as long as it takes,\" the embassy wrote on Twitter.\n\n7:35 a.m.:\n\n7:15 a.m.: Germany will end a program aimed at helping Ukrainian refugees exchange their hryvnia currency into euros on October 30, Reuters reported, citing a joint statement from the finance ministry and the central bank.\n\nThe move has been agreed with Ukraine's central bank, they said on Monday. Brisk demand has diminished considerably, and only very few transactions have been carried out recently, according to the statement.\n\n7:05 a.m.: NATO on Monday began its long-planned annual nuclear exercises in northwestern Europe, as tensions simmer over the war in Ukraine and President Vladimir Putins threat to use any means to defend Russian territory, The Associated Press reported.\n\nFourteen of NATOs 30 member countries were due to take part in the exercises, dubbed Steadfast Noon, which the military alliance said would involve around 60 aircraft including fighter jets and surveillance and refueling planes, and will run until October 30.\n\nThe exercises involve fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear warheads, but do not involve any live bombs.\n\nThe bulk of the war games will be held at least 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) from Russias borders. The exercises were planned before Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine in February. Russia usually holds its own annual maneuvers around the same time, and NATO is expecting Moscow to exercise its nuclear forces sometime this month.\n\n6:55 a.m.: NATO said Monday that Neptune Strike is underway and described it as a \"multi-domain exercise, organized and conducted by Naval Striking and Support Forces.\" The exercise is being conducted between October 14-28 in the Mediterranean Sea. This is in addition to NATOs annual nuclear exercise, Steadfast Noon, which began Monday in northwestern Europe and will continue until October 30.\n\n6:40 a.m.: At least six people were killed by Russian attacks on the capital and the eastern region of Sumy, Ukraine officials said Monday, after dozens of drones were launched at Kyiv, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"As of now, the number of people killed as a result of a kamikaze drone attack on a residential building has increased to three. Nineteen people have been rescued. [Rescue] work is ongoing,\" the deputy head of the presidency, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said on social media.\n\nIn the eastern region of Sumy, the regional governor meanwhile said three people had been killed and several more were injured.\n\n\"At 5:20 [0220 GMT] in the morning, three Russian rockets hit a facility of civil infrastructure. At least three people died. Nine are injured.

All designated objects were hit,\" the Russian defense ministry said.\n\nRussia has escalated its missile strikes across Ukraine after an explosion hit a landmark bridge linking Russia to the annexed Crimean peninsula earlier this month.\n\nFollowing that blast, Russia unleashed its largest missile attacks since the start of the invasion, hitting targets in more than a dozen cities and regions across the country, and has launched several follow-up missile strikes in the days since.\n\n5:30 a.m.: The new United Nations human rights chief, who took office on Monday as Russian drones struck the Ukrainian capital, said attacks on civilians in Ukraine had to stop.\n\n\"We have received reports from our colleagues on the ground about these drone attacks and it is absolutely important that...civilians are not targeted, this is very difficult in densely populated urban areas,\" Volker Turk of Austria, the new High Commissioner for Human Rights, said.\n\nRespecting international human rights law and humanitarian law was \"absolutely critical, so the big call is to de-escalate,\" he told reporters.\n\nA new wave of Russian drone attacks hit Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities on Monday, causing people to scramble for cover during the morning rush hour for the second successive week.\n\nTurk, a U.N. veteran who had been a senior aide to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, succeeded Chile's Michelle Bachelet, whose term ended on August 31.\n\n5 a.m.: Ukraine's air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said on Monday that they have destroyed 37 Russian drones since Sunday evening, around 85-86% of the number involved in attacks, Reuters reported.\n\n\"That's quite a good result for the work of our air defenses and that number will rise in the future,\" he told a news briefing, adding that all the drones had flown into Ukraine from the south.\n\n4:30 a.m.: Iran said on Monday that it had not provided Russia with drones to use in Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\n\"The published news about Iran providing Russia with drones has political ambitions and it's circulated by western sources. We have not provided weaponry to any side of the countries at war,\" said Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani during a weekly press conference.\n\n4:15 a.m.: Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said after a new wave of Russian drone attacks on Ukrainian cities on Monday that Russia should be expelled from the Group of 20 major economies and other international groups.\n\n\"Those who give orders to attack critical infrastructure to freeze civilians and organize total mobilization to cover the frontline with corpses, cannot sit at the same table with leaders of G20 for sure. Time to put an end to Russian hypocrisy. The Russian Federation must be expelled from all platforms,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\n4 a.m.: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday that Russia had launched a barrage of drone and missile attack across his country but that the attacks would not \"break\" Ukrainians, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"All night and all morning, the enemy terrorizes the civilian population. Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine. The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us,\" he said.\n\nHe confirmed a residential building in Kyiv had been hit, after the mayor of the capital said two people had been trapped under the rubble.\n\n3:30 a.m.: The European Union is seeking concrete evidence for any Iranian involvement in Russia's war on Ukraine, Reuters reported Monday, citing the bloc's top diplomat.\n\nUkraine has reported a spate of Russian attacks with Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in recent weeks. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin has not commented.\n\n\"We will look for concrete evidence about the participation (of Iran in the Ukraine war),\" Josep Borrell told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, adding Ukraine's Dmytro Kuleba would take part in the gathering.\n\nThe EU could decide to move towards imposing new sanctions against Iran over the matter, according to two diplomats involved in preparing talks among the ministers, though no detailed decisions were expected on Monday.\n\nDenmark's Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the EU should react strongly to new air attacks on Kyiv where drones struck buildings near a central railway station during rush hours on Monday morning.\n\n\"What we can see now: Iranian drones are used apparently to attack in the middle of Kyiv, this is an atrocity,\" Kofod said, saying the EU had to take \"concrete steps\" in response to that, as well as Tehran cracking down on protesters at home.\n\n3:15 a.m.: Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was disconnected from the national power grid on Monday following Russian shelling, prompting backup diesel generators to kick in, state nuclear energy firm Energoatom said.\n\n\"Russian terrorists once again shelled critical infrastructure substations in Ukraine-controlled territory, resulting in the shutdown of the last 750 kV ZNPP-Dniprovska communications line at 03:59,\" it said in a statement.\n\nRussian forces have occupied the plant in southern Ukraine, Europe's largest, since shortly after invading Ukraine nearly eight months ago but it is operated by Ukrainian staff.\n\n3 a.m.: Ukrainian army spokesman Oleksandr Shtupun said that Russians have begun the evacuation of \"state institutions\" from the Kherson region to Crimea, according to The Associated Press.\n\nHe added that due to the mobilization of medical workers, civilians are being denied medical care in the Belgorod region.\n\nShtupun said the Ukrainian army carried out 20 strikes over the past day.\n\n\"Seventeen areas of concentration of weapons and military equipment, as well as four positions of the enemy's anti-aircraft missile systems, were confirmed to have been hit\", he said.\n\n2:25 a.m.: Multiple explosions hit Ukraine's capital Monday, with the head of the Ukrainian president's office saying Russian forces had attacked using Iranian-made drones.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klichko said blasts took place in the central Shevchenko district, the same area where Russian missiles struck last week as part of widespread airstrikes across the country.\n\nKlichko said Monday's attack damaged several apartment blocks and sparked a fire in a non-residential building.\n\nAndrii Yermak, the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, attributed the attacks to so-called kamizake drones, a tactic Russia has used recently to crash drones into a target.\n\nLast week's attacks interrupted a long stretch of relative quiet in Kyiv.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said those strikes and the ones elsewhere were in retaliation for an attack on a key bridge linking Crimea to Russia.\n\n1:45 a.m.: In response to the morning attacks on the city of Kyiv, Ukrainians are seeking shelter in basements and subway stations, according to multiple media reports. The targets of the attacks included the headquarters of Ukraine's national energy utility, Ukrainian officials said, according to The New York Times.\n\n12:34 a.m.: Logistical issues faced by Russian forces in southern Ukraine have become more acute following damage to a key bridge to Crimea on October 8, a British intelligence update said on Monday.\n\n\"With the Russian presence in Kherson strained, and the supply routes through Crimea degraded, the ground line of communication through Zaporizhzhia Oblast is becoming more important to the sustainability of Russias occupation,\" the U.K. Ministry of Defense tweeted in a regular bulletin.\n\nRussian forces in southern Ukraine are likely increasing logistical supply flow via Mariupol in an attempt to compensate for the reduced capacity of the bridge, the update said.\n\n12:05 a.m.: Daniel Boffey, The Guardian's chief reporter, tweeted about three Kamikaze drone strikes in Kyiv.\n\n12:05 a.m.: Pope Francis said the need to reform the United Nations was \"more than obvious\" after the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war exposed its limits, in an extract of his new book published Sunday, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe Argentine pontiff said Russia's February invasion of Ukraine highlighted the need to ensure the current multilateral structure especially the U.N. Security Council finds \"more agile and effective ways of resolving conflicts.\"\n\n\"In wartime, it is essential to affirm that we need more multilateralism and a better multilateralism,\" but the U.N. is no longer fit for \"new realities,\" he added in an extract published by La Stampa daily.\n\nThe organization was founded to prevent the horrors of two World Wars from happening again, but although the threat represented by those conflicts was still alive, \"today's world is no longer the same,\" said Francis.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

                "cc_text": "\"The United Nations is dead,\" said the Catholic Herald in 1947, two years after the UN was founded. Reports of its demise are perennial, but they seem to have reached a crescendo this year, with Russias invasion of Ukraine considered a litmus test for the 77-year-old organization.\n\nRussias wanton act of aggression is not the first time one of the five permanent members, or P5, of the Security Council has invaded a country. But its hard not to see the UN as failing to constrain this permanent-member-gone-rogue from threatening nuclear war to deploying rape as a \"military strategy.\"\n\nCould it have done better? Some commentators think it has exceeded expectations. They rightly note that the lack of mechanisms to constrain the P5 Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States was part of the UNs founding bargain and argue that the organization has nonetheless mounted a response to the invasion that would be inconceivable in most other situations.\n\nWith Russias veto neutralizing the Security Council, the General Assembly has adopted four strong resolutions condemning Russias actions. The Human Rights Council created a Commission of Inquiry and Special Rapporteur for Russia the first for a P5 state. Secretary-General Antnio Guterres has been unusually outspoken about the war and played a key role in brokering the Black Sea grain deal. The wider system sounded the alarm on the impacts of the invasion on global food, energy and financial security.\n\nOther writers and pundits, mainly from the P5 countries, have adopted a reductionist view of the UN that is almost as anachronistic as the Security Council. They say that it was never meant to do more than avoid big-power confrontation, ignoring the evolution of the system over the past seven decades as well as the glaring question marks impossible to ignore in Britain right now as to who exactly is a big power today.\n\nUkrainians fighting and living on the front lines are unlikely to find solace in these arguments. Neither are Tigrayans, failed again by the Council last week, Palestinians who have suffered the veto for decades or groups like Sri Lankas Tamils, who dont even make it to the agenda.\n\nPassBlue Related Articles You might be interested in these posts.

We need to keep pegging away on making the system work better for Ukrainians and everyone whose plight is being ignored.\n\nUnfortunately, the recent spike of interest in UN reform is unlikely to deliver, unless we can change the Venn diagram of whats desirable and feasible. So far, we are stuck in familiar territory: debunked ruses to remove Russias permanent seat; rehashed procedural fixes; proposals that seem to exist in a political vacuum; and warm words on the need for reform, la President Bidens September speech at the UN General Assembly.\n\nWe need to channel this energy into building the political coalitions necessary for change and thinking more creatively about the system as a whole.\n\nAt present, we play into the UNs power imbalance by focusing on the Council and the P5, in particular. Instead, we should look at how to better leverage the collective power of the remaining 188 members, especially as the US and Europeans, to a lesser extent, are seeking to demonstrate global solidarity.\n\nCould smaller and medium-size countries coalesce around achievable reforms that chip away at P5 privilege? Changing the \"penholder\" system that allows the P5 to dominate drafting resolutions in the Council, for instance? Or finding a stronger role for the African Union in crafting peacekeeping mandates, including by ensuring AU missions are funded through the UN budget?\n\nSimilarly, what would happen if these countries refused to stand for Council seats, so the P5 must own their own failures? Could they effectively go on strike by not taking part in other elections or fielding candidates for positions until their demands for progress are met?\n\nThe biggest prize would be agreement on which states are candidates for future permanent or longer-term Council seats. Currently, the P5 can afford to be vocal champions of reform, knowing that such agreement is unlikely.\n\nBut there is broad consensus on issues such as increasing General Assembly action on peace and security. In the past, the Assembly has strengthened the mandate of peacekeeping missions; endorsed sweeping sanctions (against apartheid South Africa); and, more recently, created a mechanism to support accountability in Syria. Earlier this year, it agreed to convene automatically when a veto is cast in the Security Council.\n\nWhat more could be done if the presidents office of the Assembly was reinforced? Could the Assembly take more concrete action when the Human Rights Council and other Geneva-based rights mechanisms sound the alarms?\n\nFinally, we need to look beyond the traditional peace and security actors. The so-called return of geopolitics has downgraded much-needed debates on the UNs development and humanitarian functions, which are crucial to prevention and peace-building. Overstretched and underfunded, these tasks continue to absorb the bulk of the UNs resources.\n\nHow much more could the UN achieve if it played to its unique strengths mediation, norm-setting convening and launched a concerted drive to divest other tasks to entities that could handle them effectively and with more legitimacy? And how much stronger would implementation of global decisions be if actors such as parliaments, local governments and civil society were integrated into UN decision-making and delivery?\n\nToo many UN debates call for an end to business as usual, while proposing exactly that strategy. Without fresh political and creative energy, those of us working on reform risk falling into the same trap. The worlds people deserve better.\n\nThis is an opinion essay.\n\nWe welcome your\n\nThis is an opinion essay.We welcome your comments on this article .

At that time, the report warned that pre-COP26 climate promises would put the world on track for a temperature rise of at least 2.7C by 2100.\n\nCompared to last year, the UNEP is warning that over the past year, despite the hopes of COP26, virtually no progress has been made on combating climate change and meeting the Paris Agreement targets.\n\nDisappearing opportunities\n\nThe report warned that it was not possible to delay any further, and that the last opportunities to limit global warming to the 1.5C laid out in the Paris Agreement were now fast disappearing.\n\nIt called for a 45% cut in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 to keep the globe on track for 1.5C by 2100, while a 30% by 2030 cut would limit global warming to 2C by the end of the century.\n\nInger Andersen, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and executive director of the UNEP, noted that NDCs, sometimes called pledges, updated since COP26 had only shaved less than 1% off projected GHG emissions in 2030, far off the 45% reduction over and above current policies the report identified to meet 1.5C.\n\n\"The science from UNEPs Emissions Gap Report and indeed science presented by our friends at the UNFCCC and the WMO earlier this week is resounding: we are sliding from climate crisis to climate disaster,\" she warned.\n\n\"We need a root-and-branch redesign of the electricity sector, of the transport sector, of the building sector and of food systems. And we need to reform financial systems so that they can bankroll the transformations we cannot escape,\" she said.\n\nPut simply, the world is nowhere near meeting the Paris Agreement goals if the track record of the past year is anything to go by.\n\nHastening the transition\n\nThe UNEPs dire warnings contrast with the International Energy Agencys (IEA) small ray of hope is the form of its World Energy Outlook 2022. The IEA said that the global energy crisis could be a historic turning point towards a cleaner and more secure future, with demand for fossil fuels set to peak by around 2025.\n\nThe crisis triggered by Russias invasion of Ukraine is causing profound and long-lasting changes that have the potential to hasten the transition to a more sustainable and secure energy system.\n\nYet even with this 2025 peak, the report warned that it still predicted that global warming could only be limited to 2.5C by 2100 if current government policies continue. The 2025 peak would also allow the share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix could fall from around 80% just now to just above 60% by 2050. Global CO2 emissions would fall back slowly from a high point of 37bn tonnes per year to 32bn tpy by 2050.\n\nWhile welcome, the 2025 peak in fossil fuels is nowhere near soon enough to meet the Paris goals, a conclusion shared by the UNEP report.\n\nIEA reports 2.5 C\n\nThe IEAs report stressed that the war in Ukraine had had a deep impact on global green politics and investment, effectively nudging the world towards green technology.\n\nThe report referred to such responses as the US Inflation Reduction Act, the EUs Fit for 55 package and REPowerEU, Japans Green Transformation (GX) programme, and ambitious clean energy targets in China and India. These could raise global clean energy investment to $2 trillion per year by 2030, 50% more than today.\n\nThe IEA said that todays prevailing policy settings which it calls the Stated Policies Scenario could make every fossil fuel exhibit a peak or plateau in demand in the coming years. For coal, the plateau would be about 2025, for gas the end of the decade and for oil the mid-2030s. This means that total demand for fossil fuels declines steadily from the mid-2020s to 2050.\n\nThe IES said that the way to reduce emissions and to meet the Paris targets is for governments and corporations to undertake a rapid increase in investment in green technology.\n\nFor example, the IEA predicts that current investment trends will raise green spending to $2 trillion per year by 2030, as set out in the reports States Policies Scenario. However, to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, investment must reach $4 trillion, or twice as much as currently planned, by 2030.\n\nInvestment and supportive government policies are needed to develop both green technology, led by solar PV, wind, EVs and batteries,\n\nDespite these welcome trends, pushed forward by the war in Ukraine disrupting global energy systems, the main takeaway is that the world is still far from being able to contain climate change.\n\nOnly major and rapid changes in energy spending priorities that will cause major dislocation to global political and economic systems can even come close to meeting the Paris targets.",

Another removed tests from its website after The BMJ got in touch.\n\nExamples of private testing include regular blood tests which promise to predict how many healthy years of life a person has left, a tiredness and fatigue finger prick test that measures iron, thyroid hormones, vitamin levels, and inflammation, and screening with the option of a full refund if users results fall within the normal range.\n\nBut Bernie Croal, president of the Association for Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine, points out that 5% of test results will lie outside the normal reference range, so very few people will have no \"abnormal\" results, even if theres nothing wrong with them.\n\nWhats more, many of these tests are not recommended by the National Screening Committee \"because it is not clear that the benefits outweigh the harms\" yet GPs are often asked by patients to review the results of private blood tests, creating more work for an already stretched NHS.\n\nIn 2019 the Royal College of General Practitioners published a position statement about private health screening, warning that \"the organisation initiating the screening should not assume that GPs will deal with the results.\"\n\nHowever, the companies selling tests believe there is a role for private testing.\n\nSam Rodgers, a practising GP in southeast London and chief medical officer at Medichecks, points out that people are directed to their GP after its testing in about 7% of cases, while Nightingale said its tests were for \"prediction and prevention rather than diagnosis or treatment\" and it didnt provide test results as such but overall risk information and lifestyle guidance.\n\nYet it is clear there is wide variation in the amount and accuracy of information provided to consumers when purchasing tests online, writes Wilkinson.\n\nFor instance, prostate cancer risk (PSA) testing is available on the NHS for men without symptoms over the age of 50, after a discussion with a GP about the risks and benefits. Yet private tests are easily available with no age recommendation at all, and some contradict official advice about their accuracy.\n\nWilkinson reports that private tests are also promoted by the NHS endorsed Patient Access app, despite being something that the NHS positively discourages.\n\nShaun OHanlon at EMIS, the healthcare IT company behind the app, says that all private provider testing services listed on Patient Access have been selected after a thorough review by the clinical team, which includes UK GPs, while NHS Digital says that services offered through third party apps or websites connected to the NHS login service are the responsibility of the companies providing them.\n\nBut experts are calling for better regulation. Dr Margaret McCartney and colleagues say the NHS \"needs to robustly explain the criteria for high quality screening and testing, and explain when consumers should be sceptical and what they should question.\"\n\nThey argue that the Care Quality Commission (CQC) should be empowered to appraise the apps that promote private screening as well as the screening companies themselves, and say placing a responsibility on companies to undertake the further investigation of abnormal test rest results \"could help reduce negative impact on the NHS.\"\n\n[Ends]\n\nNotes for editors\n\nInvestigation: The rise of direct-to-consumer testing: is the NHS paying the price?

Credit... Emile Ducke for The New York Times\n\nRIGA, Latvia Russia is massing thousands of troops in its western neighbor Belarus ahead of what could be the opening of a new front aimed at disrupting the flow of Western military aid from Poland, according to defense officials in Latvia and Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the assembled forces, about 10,000 troops, may still be too weak to make a successful new thrust south from Belarus, Latvias defense minister, Artis Pabriks, said on Friday.\n\n\"We have to be cautious, but I doubt that Russians are at this moment capable of opening another front line against Ukraine, at least not a successful front,\" Mr. Pabriks said in an interview in Riga, the capital of Latvia, which borders both Russia and Belarus.\n\nAn announcement last week by Belarus that it was forming a new joint military force with Russia stirred alarm in the West that the Kremlin might be preparing a new ground assault with help from Belarusian forces. Russia massed troops in Belarus ahead of its initial attack on Ukraine in February.\n\nOn Thursday, a Ukrainian general, Oleksiy Gromov, said that the threat of a possible invasion from Belarus was growing. He said that a new attack would likely not drive toward Kyiv which lies just 60 miles from the border with Belarus but rather to the west of the capital, nearer to the Polish border. An offensive south from western Belarus into Ukrainian territory near the border with Poland could disrupt the flow of weapons to Ukraine from the United States and its allies, much of which passes through Poland.\n\nThe military officials in Riga and Kyiv did not say precisely where the Russian troops were gathering, nor why they believed a new offensive could occur closer to Poland than to Kyiv.\n\nRussia used the territory of Belarus, its closest military and political ally, as a staging ground for its February invasion and has since launched missiles and drones into Ukraine from there. But President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Belaruss veteran strongman leader, has resisted Russias pressure to get directly involved in the war.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Lukashenko said it would be undesirable for Belarusian military equipment to be used in Ukraine and denied his countrys troops were training for war, adding \"no war today. We dont need it,\" the state news agency Belta reported.\n\nMr. Lukashenko made a similar statement in February, just days before Russia invaded Ukraine from his territory.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraines armed forces said in a statement that if the country were attacked again from Belarus, it would \"respond as fiercely as we respond to all occupiers.\" A new front in the north would inevitably pull Ukrainian forces away from the south and east, where they have launched offensives to take back land Russia captured early in the war.\n\nThe flurry of military activity in Belarus in recent days, Britains defense ministry said on Friday, is \"likely an attempt to demonstrate Russian-Belarusian solidarity and to convince Ukraine to divert forces to guard the northern border.\"\n\nNoting claims by Mr. Lukashenko that 70,000 Belarusians and 15,000 Russians would be involved in their new joint force, Britains defense ministry said it was unlikely that Russia had actually deployed significant forces and added that Belarus \"maintains minimal capability to undertake complex operations.\"\n\nVadym Skibitsky, a spokesman for Ukraines military intelligence agency, said in an interview that Ukraine also did not see an immediate threat of another attack from Belarus.\n\nSeveral thousand newly mobilized Russian soldiers are deployed in Belarus at training sites, Mr. Skibitsky said, but they are not accompanied by tanks, artillery or fuel trucks and other logistical support they would need to invade and face Ukraines battle-hardened troops.\n\n\"We see these elements now moving into Belarus, but we do not see the movement of equipment,\" he said.\n\nBrig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, also played down the likelihood of a new Russian invasion from Belarus. \"We dont currently have any indications of a potential imminent military action on that front,\" he told a briefing on Thursday.\n\nAndrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.",

Ukraine has not commented.\n\nWithout providing evidence, Russia accused British troops of being involved in Saturday's attack - and in blowing up gas pipelines last month.\n\nIn its response, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia was \"peddling false claims of an epic scale\".\n\nRussia said the ships targeted in Saturday's attack were involved in the internationally-brokered deal to allow grain exports from Ukrainian ports and hours later announced that it was suspending its participation in it.\n\nThe attack comes as Ukrainian troops successfully retake territory occupied by Russian troops since they launched their invasion on 24 February.\n\nRussia has replied by launching large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly on the country's energy grid.\n\nCrimea was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and is extremely symbolic for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn recent weeks, several attacks have hit the peninsula, where the Russian army has built up a large presence.\n\nSevastopol is the largest city in the region and home to Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-installed governor of the city, said Russia's navy had repelled the latest attack - the \"most massive\" on the city since February.\n\nHe said that all unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) had been shot down and no \"civilian infrastructure\" had been damaged.\n\nAt least one vessel sustained minor damage, the Russian ministry of defence said.\n\n\"In the course of repelling a terrorist attack on the outer roadstead of Sevastopol, the use of naval weapons and naval aviation of the Black Sea Fleet destroyed four marine unmanned vehicles, three more devices were destroyed on the internal roadstead,\" a statement from the ministry read.\n\nThe Ukrainian government rarely comments on claims made by Russian authorities in Crimea, although senior officials often celebrate incidents in the peninsula.\n\nUkraine has vowed to recapture all territory that is under Russian occupation, including Crimea, which has been a key base for President Putin's forces during the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWithout providing any evidence, the Russian defence ministry also accused British navy specialists of helping Ukrainian forces prepare the attack on Saturday morning.\n\nIt also said the same unit was \"involved in plotting, organising, and implementation of the terrorist attack in the Baltic Sea on 26 September this year to blow up the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines\".\n\nIn its reply, the MoD said: \"To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.\n\n\"This invented story, says more about arguments going on inside the Russian Government than it does about the west.\"\n\nIn recent days, Russia has been engaged in what US and Ukrainian officials describe as a disinformation campaign, with unsubstantiated claims that Kyiv is preparing to use a radioactive dirty bomb, or even biological mosquitoes.\n\nRussia has also claimed that the ships targeted on Saturday morning were involved in ensuring the \"grain corridor\" as part of the international initiative to export agricultural products from Ukrainian ports.\n\nThe agreement, brokered by the UN and Turkey, allowed Ukraine to resume its Black Sea grain exports, which had been blocked when Russia invaded the country. It was personally negotiated by the UN secretary general and celebrated as a major diplomatic victory that helped ease a global food crisis.\n\nBut Russia complains that its own exports are still hindered, and had previously suggested it might not renew the deal.\n\nIn recent days, Kyiv has accused Moscow of deliberately delaying the passage of ships, creating a queue of more than 170 vessels.\n\nRussia's Black Sea Fleet was previously targeted in April this year by Ukrainian forces when its flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk. The 510-crew missile cruiser had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, and its sinking was a major symbolic and military blow.\n\nEarlier this month, a blast occurred on the Crimean bridge - a pivotal symbol of Russia's annexation of Crimea.",

REUTERS/Vladyslav Musiienko/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nUNITED NATIONS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Russia said on Wednesday that it will reassess cooperation with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres if he sends experts to Ukraine to inspect drones that Western powers say were made in Iran and used by Moscow in violation of a U.N. resolution.\n\nSpeaking after a closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting on Moscow's use of drones, Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy called on Guterres and his staff to \"abstain from engaging in any illegitimate investigation.\"\n\n\"Otherwise, we will have to reassess our collaboration with them, which is hardly in anyone's interests. We do not want to do it, but there will be no other choice,\" he told reporters.\n\nPolyanskiy did not elaborate.\n\nThe Security Council met on Russia's use of drones in Ukraine at the request of the United States, France and Britain, who argue that the drones are Iranian made and used by Moscow in violation of a 2015 resolution endorsing the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nTehran denies supplying the drones to Moscow and Russia has denied its forces had used Iranian drones to attack Ukraine.\n\n\"Iran has obligations not to export these weapons,\" Britain's Deputy U.N. Ambassador James Kariuki posted on Twitter after the meeting. \"As a member of the U.N., Iran has a responsibility not to support Russia's war of aggression.\"\n\nUkraine this week invited U.N. experts to inspect some downed drones. Guterres reports twice a year to the Security Council - traditionally in June and December - on the implementation of the 2015 resolution. Any assessment of the drones in Ukraine would likely be included in that report.\n\n\"As a matter of policy, we are always ready to examine any information and analyze any information brought to us by Member States,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Wednesday.\n\nGRAIN DEAL\n\nIran and Russia both argue that there is no mandate for Guterres to send experts to Ukraine to inspect the drones.\n\nIn a letter to Guterres on Wednesday, Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani said Ukraine's invitation to U.N. experts \"lacks any legal foundation\" and called on Guterres \"to prevent any misuse\" of the resolution and U.N. officials on issues related to the Ukraine war.\n\nFrench U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said Guterres has a \"clear mandate twice a year to report on all these things and to make technical assessments, so I think the U.N. secretariat will have to go and will go.\"\n\nUnder the 2015 resolution, a conventional arms embargo on Iran was in place until October 2020.\n\nBut Ukraine and Western powers argue that the resolution still includes restrictions on missiles and related technologies until October 2023 and can encompass the export and purchase of advanced military systems such as drones.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council is unable to take any substantial action over the war in Ukraine because Russia holds a veto on the 15-member body, along with China, the United States, France and Britain.\n\nDujarric declined to comment on Polyanskiy's remarks.\n\nGuterres and senior U.N. officials are negotiating with Russia to extend and expand a July 22 deal that resumed Ukraine Black Sea grain and fertilizer exports. The pact could expire later next month if an agreement is not reached.\n\nPolyanskiy said he was not optimistic about a renewal because Russian exports of grain and fertilizer were being hindered. But when asked if Russian cooperation on the Black Sea grain deal could be at risk if Guterres sends experts to Ukraine to look at the drones, Polyanskiy said: \"I don't make direct link so far.\"\n\nReporting by Michelle Nichols; editing by Grant McCool\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

While welcome, the report underlined that these efforts remained insufficient to limit global temperature rise to the Paris limit of 1.5C.\n\nThe report found that current commitments will increase emissions by 10.6% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels.\n\nThis is an improvement over the same bodys 2021 assessment, which found countries were on a path to increase emissions by 13.7% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels.\n\nCredit: UNFCCC\n\nEmissions peak\n\nThe major positive take-away from the report is the best scenario, emissions are no longer forecast to be increasing after 2030, in contrast to the 2021 forecast, which showed projected emissions would continue to rise beyond 2030.\n\nThe best forecast in the report, which would rely on all current NDCs being implemented in future with all their conditional elements, would mean that emissions would stand at 49.1bn tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2030, 6.6% lower than 2019 levels of 52.6bn tonnes and 5.1% less than 2025 emissions of 51.8bn tonnes. This forecast foresees emission levelling out before 2025.\n\nThese conditional elements are a hard sell, though, requiring a range of optimal developments. These include: access to enhanced financial resources; technology transfer and technical co-operation; capacity-building support; availability of market-based mechanisms; and absorptive capacity of forests and other ecosystems.\n\nA more realistic forecast, which only takes into account current active NDCs, puts 2030 emissions at 52.5bn tonnes, although this is still below the 2025 forecast of 53.4bn tonnes, suggesting that peak emissions would be reached between 2025 and 2030.\n\nThe UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes 2018 report indicated that CO2 emissions needed to be cut 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels.\n\nThe latest science from the IPCC released earlier this year uses 2019 as a baseline, indicating that GHG emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030. This is critical to meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall.\n\nCredit: UNFCCC\n\nOn to 2050\n\nLooking ahead to 2050, UN Climate Change said in a separate report that with long-term, low-emission development strategies that GHG could be roughly 68% lower in 2050 than in 2019, if all the long-term strategies are fully implemented on time.\n\nThe report examined current long-term strategies that represent 62 Parties to the Paris Agreement, accounting for 83% of the worlds GDP, 47% of global population in 2019, and around 69% of total energy consumption in 2019.\n\nThe UN said its report sent a strong signal that the world was starting to aim for net-zero emissions.\n\nThe report noted, however, that many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone into the future critical action that needs to take place now.\n\nAmbitious climate action before 2030 is urgently needed to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nLooking back to 2021\n\nIn January, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) found in its own assessment of the NDCs that the pledges would limit global warming by 1.8C by 2050 and 2.1C by 2100.\n\nIRENA warned at the time in no uncertain terms that the renewable energy commitments in current NDCs are nowhere near those required to meet the 1.5C target for 2100, or the 2050 net-zero target.\n\nIRENA's finding that only 30 NDCs explicitly mention heating and cooling or transport, and only 13 parties have committed to a percentage of renewables in their overall energy mixes, is wholly inadequate.",

                "cc_text": "Speaker for Moscow Disputes Western States Requested Investigation as to Whether Russian Federation Violated Council Resolution 2231 (2015)\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General and Secretariat staff are international officials responsible only to the Organization and must not seek or receive instructions from any Government, the Security Council heard today, as the Russian Federation took issue with the request of several delegations, including the United States, for an investigation into whether the Russian Federation violated Council resolution 2231 (2015).\n\nMiguel de Serpa Soares, Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and United Nations Legal Counsel, briefed members on Article 100 of the United Nations Charter, explaining obligations on the part of Member States, namely, to respect the exclusively international character of the responsibilities of the Secretary-General and the staff. It is only natural that Member States should wish to exercise as much influence as they can over the activities of the Organization, including its Secretariat, he said, adding: \"I myself frequently receive visits from Ambassadors who advance a particular view of the law and try to convince me that it is correct\".\n\nTurning to resolution 2231 (2015), he said the Secretariat takes note of all information brought to its attention by Member States to ascertain and assess its relevance to the discharge of its mandates. He underscored a relevant note (document S/2016/44), which had anticipated that a forthcoming report would produce findings and recommendations and that the Council would meet informally prior to the public release of the report to review them. The Secretary-General duly acted on those requests and the Security Council Affairs Division has prepared the reports, he said, with the most recent and thirteenth report issued on 23 June. He added that the Secretary-General had not received any request, pursuant to the note or otherwise, that supplements or modifies the nature and scope of the Divisions work in preparing the Secretary-Generals six-monthly reports to the Council.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation said that his country did not convene the meeting to discuss the implementation of Council resolution 2231 (2015). Actions in question concern documented attempts by the United States, United Kingdom and France, accompanied by Germany through letters on 21 October 2022 to the Council President to deliver individual instructions to the Secretariat, in violation of Article 100 of the Charter. The two letters provide documented evidence that the Member States are violating paragraph 2 of the Charter, which requires them to respect the international character of Secretariats duties and to not try to exert influence on its staff in the discharge of their duties, he said. He disputed the legitimacy of the request by some Member States for an investigation, calling such action by Western colleagues exceedingly dangerous.\n\nThe representative of the United States emphasized that his country and other Council members had not given instructions to, but rather requested the Secretary-General to take action. Pointing out that in August, the Russian Federation had requested that the Secretary-General investigate killings at a prison in eastern Ukraine, to which the Secretary-General decided to conduct a fact-finding mission, he emphasized that \"such requests for investigations are common\". Regarding resolution 2231 (2015), he stressed that it is well established and is within the authority of the Secretary-General to investigate allegations of violations, stressing that acceding to Moscow's demand that the Secretariat not carry out its mandate would be extremely problematic.\n\nIrans delegate said that any misuse of the function described in note S/2016/44 to conduct a so-called investigation would be illegal and in clear violation of the Secretariat's mandate. Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, Iran has maintained a position of active neutrality. \"Iran has never provided the parties with weapons for use in the Ukraine conflict,\" he stressed, rejecting all \"unfounded\" allegations made against his country.\n\nThe speaker for the United Arab Emirates stressed that the independence of the Secretariat is necessary for the proper discharging of its duties. \"There cannot be sovereign equality of Member States if anyone is able to instruct the Secretariat to act or refrain from acting in a certain manner,\" she added.\n\nUkraines delegate said that the deliberate misuse of the Charter and its provisions to impede an investigation on the implementation of Council resolutions is a clear attempt to pressure the Secretariat. The use of Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles in attacks against civilians is a blatant violation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Charter and international humanitarian law. She reiterated her call for an immediate investigation and requested the United Nations experts to inspect the recovered unmanned aerial vehicles of Iranian origin.\n\nFrances representative said the facts are clear: Iran provided drones to the Russian Federation, which then used them in the service of its war of aggression, and indiscriminate bombing against civilian targets. \"Indeed, it is Russia that is engaging in blackmail by threatening to break ties with the United Nations if the Secretariat does not bend to its will,\" he said.\n\nAlso speaking today were representatives of India, Albania, Ireland, Ghana, Brazil, Norway, Mexico, China, United Kingdom, Kenya and Gabon.\n\nThe Council meeting began at 4:43 p.m. and ended at 6:22 p.m.\n\nBriefing\n\nMIGUEL DE SERPA SOARES, Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and United Nations Legal Counsel, briefed the Council on Article 100 of the United Nations Charter, which he said sets out obligations for the Secretary-General and the Secretariat staff relating to the conduct of their work. Paragraph 1 of the Article 100 affirms that the Secretary-General and Secretariat staff are \"international officials responsible only to the Organization\" and must not \"seek or receive instructions from any government or from any other authority external to the United Nations\". Paragraph 1 also states that they must \"refrain from any action which might reflect on their position as international officials responsible only to the Organization\", he said. Since they were first adopted by the General Assembly in 1951, the Staff Regulations have affirmed that members of the Secretariat are international civil servants, their responsibilities are exclusively international and they must not accept instructions regarding the performance of their duties from any Government or source external to the Organization.\n\nParagraph 2 of Article 100 sets out two corresponding obligations on the part of Member States, namely, to respect the exclusively international character of the responsibilities of the Secretary-General and the staff and not to seek to influence them in the discharge of their duties, he explained. The Assembly has referred to the paragraph in connection with appeals to all Member States to respect the privileges and immunities of United Nations officials and to allow the Secretary-General to exercise the Organizations right of functional protection in respect of staff placed under arrest or detention. However, beyond that the Assembly has not given any specific guidance on the application of the paragraph. The Secretary-General and the Legal Counsel have however \"taken the position that this or that action on the part of a Member State is or is not consistent with its obligations pursuant to Article 100 of the Charter\", he recalled.\n\nThey have expressed the view that it would not, or might not, be consistent with paragraph 2 of that Article for a State to limit the appointment of staff of its nationality to fixed-term appointments; pressure the Secretary-General to replace a qualified staff member because of a change of Government in their home State; cancel the work permit of a staff member in an apparent attempt to force the Secretary-General to dismiss them; withhold a staff members passport so that they could not return to their duty station; and refuse to recognize the Secretary-General as Secretary-General. The Secretary-General and Legal Counsel have taken the position that it would not be inconsistent with paragraph 2 of Article 100 for a State to submit to the Secretary-General information on the character and record of candidates of its nationality, provided that it was understood that it was left to the Secretary-General to assess that information and reach an independent decision on their recruitment.\n\nIt is only natural that Member States should wish to exercise as much influence as they can over the activities of the Organization, including its Secretariat, he said, adding: \"I myself frequently receive visits from Ambassadors who advance a particular view of the law and try to convince me that it is correct\".\n\nTurning to the work performed by the Secretary-General and the Secretariat with respect to resolution 2231 (2015), the Secretariat takes note of all information brought to its attention by Member States to ascertain and assess its relevance to the discharge of the mandates that are entrusted to it, he said. It was in this spirit that Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo noted in her remarks to the Council during its informal consultations on 19 October 2022 that the Secretariat was ready to assess information if requested by Member States.\n\nFollowing the Councils adoption of resolution 2231 on 20 July 2015, the Council President issued a note dated 16 January 2016 under the symbol S/2016/44 that \"sets forth practical arrangements and procedures for the Security Council for carrying out tasks related to the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015), particularly with respect to the provisions specified in paragraphs 2 to 7 of Annex B to that resolution\". Paragraphs 6 and 7 of that note requested the Secretary-General to appoint the Security Council Affairs Division of what is now the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs to serve as a point of contact and support the work of the Council and to report to the Council every six months on the implementation of the resolution. Paragraph 7 of the note anticipated that the report would include findings and recommendations and that the Council would meet informally prior to the public release of the report to review the findings and recommendations it contained, he said.\n\nThe Secretary-General duly acted on those requests and the Security Council Affairs Division has prepared the reports, he said, adding that the most recent and thirteenth report was issued on 23 June under the symbol S/2022/490. Introducing the first report, then Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman pointed out that \"[t]his reportstrictly focuses on the restrictive measures in annex B of resolution 2231 (2015)[o]ur mandate is neither to report on all aspects of the resolution or annex A of the JCPOA, nor touch upon the work of the Joint Commission established in the agreement.\" The Secretariat has reported on the implementation of the restrictive measures in Annex B that are in force during the reporting period, including on information voluntarily brought to its attention by Member States in writing and through meetings. Also reflected are the positions of interested Member States on such information that has been brought to the attention of the Secretary-General.\n\nThe report includes findings and recommendations in line with paragraph 7 of the note. The Secretary-General is thus able to express his views on relevant developments during the reporting period and draw attention to matters of concern. As intended, the report is entirely for the Councils information in its consideration of the status of implementing resolution 2231 (2015), in particular Annex B, and determining whether any action is required. The Secretary-General has not received any request, pursuant to paragraph 6 (g) of the note or otherwise, that supplements or modifies the nature and scope of the work done by the Security Council Affairs Division in the preparation of the Secretary-Generals six-monthly reports to the Council. Absent further guidance by the Security Council, the Secretary-General will continue to prepare those reports in the manner that they have been prepared to date, he said.\n\nStatements\n\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) pointed out that his country did not convene the meeting to discuss the implementation of Council resolution 2231 (2015), as there is a format for that purpose, adding the question they wished to address is broader, and focuses on the risk posed by actions of some Council members to the integrity of the United Nations Charter and the ability of the Council to discharge its function of maintaining international peace and security. The actions in question concern documented attempts by the United States, United Kingdom, France, accompanied by Germany, to deliver individual instructions to the Secretariat, in violation of Article 100 of the Charter, he said, adding that the two letters provide documented evidence that the Member States violate paragraph 2 of the United Charter, which requires them to respect the international character of the duties of the Secretariat and to not try to exert influence on its staff in the discharge of their duties.\n\nHe went on to state that the violations of aforementioned States were \"double-pronged\", citing in this regard several sections of a note by the President of the Security Council (document S/2016/44), concerning the Councils role in implementing the resolution and in responding to the requests of Member States, adding that the note does not mention the role of the Secretariat. He stressed that relevant provisions of the note call for a separate decision to be taken by the Council when dealing with the implementation of the resolution or when dealing with possible violations. He went on to dispute the legitimacy of the request by some Member States for an investigation, adding that such actions by Western colleagues are exceedingly dangerous, as they try to artificially expand the purview of the Secretariat. These Member States actions are \"yet another manifestation of their egregious hypocrisy and double standards\", he stressed, adding that those who \"foamed at the mouth\" two weeks ago talking about the need to protect the United Nations Charter are now violating it.\n\nROBERT A. WOOD ( United States ) emphasized that his country and other Council members had not given instructions to, but rather requested the Secretary-General to take action, similar to countless other circumstances. Pointing out that in August, the Russian Federation had requested that the Secretary-General investigate killings at a prison in eastern Ukraine, to which the Secretary-General decided to conduct a fact-finding mission, he emphasized that \"such requests for investigations are common, appropriate and by no means in violation of Article 100 of the Charter [of the United Nations].\" Regarding resolution 2231 (2015), spotlighting that the Secretary-General has submitted to the Council 13 reports summarizing its investigations and findings on non-compliance over the past seven years, he stressed that it is well established and is within the authority of the Secretary-General to investigate allegations of violations. Noting that acceding to Moscow's demand that the Secretariat not carry out its mandate would be extremely problematic, he concluded that it would undermine the implementation of Council resolutions and give all countries \"a free pass\" to flout obligations.\n\nRAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI ( India ) expressed appreciation for the Secretariats important work in supporting the Council, the Secretary-General's periodic reports to the Council and the professional work that goes behind the preparation of such reports. He emphasized that, in preparing those reports, the Secretariat should always be guided by the mandate provided in the Councils resolution, presidential statements and notes of the President. In the current context, paragraph 7 of note 44 of 2016 by the Council President clearly requested the Secretary-General to report to the Council every six months on the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015). Voicing hope that the Secretariat will continue to objectively function on such issues and undertake its activities in accordance with the mandate provided by the Council, he stressed that respect for the provisions of the United Nations Charter is an absolute must.\n\nFERIT HOXHA ( Albania ), noting that the raison dtre of the Secretariat is to execute its mandate with objectivity and impartiality, stressed that impartiality does not mean indifference nor detachment from reality when commitments are not upheld or when the law is broken. He warned that yielding to threats against the Secretariat would create a dangerous precedent and create the impression that some countries can disregard obligations at will and with impunity. \"If what Russia says is the truth, if it has nothing to hide, if it is implementing Security Council resolutions, upholding the Charter and respecting international law, then, in the interest of truth and clarity, Russia must be the first to welcome an independent and impartial verification to bring the truth to light, welcome it, not to threaten the mandate holders, the first of them, the Secretary-General,\" he stressed. Noting Ukraines letter to the President of the Security Council about the Russian Federations use of unmanned aerial vehicles of Iranian origin, he called on the Secretariat to organize a visit to the sites, which Ukraine has offered to facilitate, collect evidence and report its findings. Following its well-established procedures, the United Nations 2231 team should analyse the available evidence impartially and report its findings to the Security Council.\n\nNICOLAS DE RIVIRE ( France ) said that indeed the Russian Federation has breached the Charter by invading its neighbour and annexing its territory. \"The facts are clear. Iran provided drones to Russia, which then use them in the service of its war of aggression, and indiscriminate bombing against civilian targets,\" he said. Those facts which might be war crimes are solidly documented. In supplying those drones without the Councils prior approval, Iran is violating Council resolution 2231 (2015), which in July 2015 was unanimously adopted. He urged Iran to immediately cease any form of support to the war of aggression launched by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and asked the Secretariat to investigate and report on the incidents to Council members. The Russian representative affirmed on 19 October in consultations that the drones in question were Russian drones. Since then, it has been difficult to understand why the Russian Federation \"does not want us to look at the debris with experts\". The Russian Federation is not respecting Article 100 of the United Nations Charter and the Secretariat's independence. \"Indeed, it is Russia that is engaging in blackmail by threatening to break ties with the United Nations if the Secretariat does not bend to its will,\" he said.\n\nCAT MORAN ( Ireland ) welcomed the invitation by Ukraine to examine recovered debris of unmanned aerial vehicles in the country to aid the independent expert investigation, adding that such actions are in keeping with the United Nations Charter, and the implementation of Council resolution 2231 (2015), in line with note 44, which requests that the Secretary-General report to the Council every six months on the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015), and has the Council meet to review the reports findings. \"No further decision of the Council is necessary in this regard,\" she said. Turning to issues concerning Article 100 of the United Nations Charter, she said unfortunately it is the Russian Federation whose actions contravene it, as it is trying to influence the Secretariat staff in the discharge of its duties, as demonstrated by the meeting. She expressed hope that the Russian Federation will cooperate with the Secretariat in conducting its work, and provide any required information in the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015).\n\nKHALILAH HACKMAN ( Ghana ), expressing support for the objectives of Council resolution 2231 (2015), urged full compliance with its provisions and support towards the investigation of any violations through appropriate channels. Voicing concern over the Russian Federations unjustified invasion of Ukraine, in violation of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, she stressed that \"it is these actions by the Russian Federation and its subsequent wielding of the veto in a manner that has so far restrained requisite Council action that casts doubts on our ability to deliver on the mandate to promote international peace and security.\" Expressing concern over the heightened rhetoric relating to the use or threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction, she urged restraint and caution against such rhetoric being used as justification for any tactical use of nuclear weapons.\n\nRONALDO COSTA FILHO ( Brazil ) stated his understanding that according to note 44 of the Council President, the Secretary-General has been mandated to report to the Council every six months on the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015). Any further action beyond this mandate should be discussed by the Council, he added, including responding to information regarding alleged actions inconsistent with the resolution. Recalling that the Secretariat has travelled in response to invitations from concerned Member States to examine and collect relevant information in the past, he expressed hope that the Secretariat will continue to carry out its mandate strictly in accordance with S/2016/44 and Article 100 of the Charter of the United Nations. Noting that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action provides a suitable framework for dialogue among the parties concerned, he said that his country counts on its original participants to conclude negotiations and immediately resume full compliance with their respective obligations under the agreement and with resolution 2231 (2015).\n\nMONA JUUL ( Norway ), voicing concern about the reported transfer of unmanned aerial vehicles from Iran to the Russian Federation for use in Ukraine, said those drones are used to attack civilians and civilian objects. Such usage is prohibited under international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes, she added. Recalling that the Secretary-General has reported 13 times to the Council on implementation of Council resolution 2231 (2015), she said there is nothing about the Secretariats conduct in connection with the request put forward in the letter from Ukraine that could substantiate the Russian Federations claims of misconduct. Voicing regret that the Russian Federation, through accusing others of violating Article 100 of the United Nations Charter, is itself disregarding the spirit of that Article, she said, underscoring it as a desperate attempt to draw attention away from its illegal war and actions.\n\nJUAN RAMN DE LA FUENTE RAMREZ ( Mexico ) said his delegation has condemned the indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against the civilian population in Ukraine, including the most recent attacks using unmanned aerial vehicles, based on the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols. There is no justification for attacks against residential buildings, infrastructure for basic services, or other civilian targets, he stressed, calling for an end to those aggressions. \"Given conflicting allegations on the origin of the drones that attacked civilians, the international community must know the truth, and to that end, an independent investigation is required that would then give way to a credible ruling,\" he said. If there is a request for the United Nations Secretariat to investigate the origin of the drones used in such attacks and given the possibility of Iranian manufacture and that the request was done after corresponding legal analysis, the request is in keeping with the provisions set forth in resolution 2231 (2015). An investigation would not run counter to the provisions contained in Article 100 of the Charter, he added. The Council must focus on finding a diplomatic solution and promote new mediation mechanisms that would strengthen the Secretary-General's efforts to bring about a cessation of hostilities, as this is the only way to completely protect the civilian population, he urged.\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ), in citing Article 100 of the Charter on the performance of duties, encouraged the Secretariat to work within its mandate, strengthen communications with Member States, enhance mutual trust, maintain unity amongst Member States and handle differences of opinion in a fair and appropriate manner. Adherence to the relevant provisions of the Charter is essential in ensuring impartiality, he emphasized. Turning to Council resolution 2233 (2015), he urged all parties to exercise rational restraint and interpret the resolutions provisions accurately so as to avoid any further complications during negotiations. Doing so also avoids undermining the hard-won results of current negotiations, he added. In light of the clear differences of interpretation regarding the Secretariats mandate, he called on the Council to provide a clear definition and avoid any hasty action which would undermine unity.\n\nLANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH ( United Arab Emirates ) stressed that the independence of the Secretariat is necessary for the proper discharging of its duties. \"There cannot be sovereign equality of Member States if anyone is able to instruct the Secretariat to act or refrain from acting in a certain manner,\" she added. Small States are most acutely aware of the risk, but really, it should worry all States who do not enjoy the privilege of a permanent Council seat. It would be nave for any Member State to pretend that Member States have never attempted to exert influence over the Secretariat. \"We may talk about attempts and even erosion at times,\" she said. It is critical to reaffirm the fundamental nature of Article 100 for the proper functioning of the Secretariat, and the Organization as a whole.\n\nJAMES KARIUKI ( United Kingdom ) stressed that the Russian Federation and Iran have been caught red-handed violating Council resolution 2231 (2015), adding: \"Russia is now complaining about process because they cannot defend their actions.\" Based on evidence supplied by Ukraine and open-source reporting, he said it is evident that Iran has supplied unmanned aerial vehicles to the Russian Federation, with which the latter is targeting Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure, and that these unmanned aerial vehicles fall under the list in Annex B paragraph 4 of Council resolution 2231 (2015). \"Given no prior approval was sought or granted by the Security Council, these transfers represent violations of resolution 2231,\" he said. Recalling that a request was made to the Secretariat to undertake an impartial expert investigation of such activities, which his country supports, he said the Russian Federations claim that this request was an attempt to unduly influence the Secretariat is \"both absurd and hypocritical\". Noting that the Russian Federation has threatened to end all cooperation with the United Nations if the Secretariat does not do as it wants, he stressed: \"That is not the behaviour of a country with nothing to hide. It is the behaviour of a bully.\" Further, noting that open-source reporting suggests that Iran intends to transfer more drones and potentially ballistic missiles to the Russian Federation, he said such transfers could constitute further violations of resolution 2231 (2015) and represent a significant escalation.\n\nCATHERINE NYABOKE NYAKOE ( Kenya ) stated that while the Secretary-Generals good offices were consequential in achieving the Black Sea Grain Initiative, they have not been engaged in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. One of the reasons for this, she asserted, is \"the impact of years of Member States questioning the Secretariats impartiality and eroding its independence.\" In outlining three ways to strengthen the good offices, she first pointed to the need to redefine impartiality and protect the independence of the Secretariat. The Secretary-General must be fully partial to the Charter of the United Nations and should fully exercise its Article 99 without regard for the approval or disapproval of any State, she continued. Touching on the importance of utilizing the Secretary-Generals fact-finding capabilities, she challenged the conflicting parties to agree to United Nations fact finding and verification, which would be key to preventing and minimizing actions contrary to the Charter and international law. Pointing to the need to strengthen regional good offices and spotlighting Africa's peace and security architecture as a good example, she urged other regions to develop and deploy similar regional arrangements for early warning, prevention and resolution of disputes.\n\nMICHEL XAVIER BIANG ( Gabon ), Council President for the month, speaking in his national capacity, said he carefully followed the authorized reading of Article 100 of the United Nations Charter provided by the briefer, which seemed to contain sufficient detail, and was draped in the mantle of impartiality of the United Nations Secretariat. Reaffirming his attachment to the integrity of the United Nations Charter, he pointed out that this vital document should form the foundation of vital negotiations that must take place to put an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nMr. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ), taking the floor for the second time, stressed that the points raised by certain members in the Council had nothing to do with the issue under discussion today, which is: What is the Secretariat guided by when expressing a willingness to engage in an investigation into alleged violations of resolution 2231 (2015) upon the request not of the Council, but rather of some Member States? He further pointed out that the fact that certain information has already been included in the Secretary-General's reports does not attest to the presence of any legitimate practice. Recalling that his country has always objected to this practice since 2016, he asked how the Council could talk about establishing a practice when it runs counter to the mandate and faces persistent objections from Council members. The question lies in the legitimacy of such an investigation in the absence of a relevant Council mandate, he added.\n\nMr. DE SERPA SOARES, taking the floor a second time, said he has no comments on the statements delivered. Addressing the question posed by the representative of the Russian Federation, he said that he had in his initial statement described the practice in terms of application of the Charter and talked about the text and practice based on resolution 2231 (2015). He has nothing to add to his initial statement, he said. Referring to \"that last issue\", he said it is a matter of text and he is not in a position to respond to hypothetical questions.\n\nKHRYSTYNA HAYOVYSHYN ( Ukraine ), in describing the Russian Federations appeal to the Charter as hypocritical and cynical, condemned that countrys unacceptable pressure and threat to reconsider its cooperation with the United Nations. The deliberate misuse of the Charter and its provisions to impede an investigation on the implementation of Council resolutions is a clear attempt to pressure the Secretariat and avoid responsibility, she said. The use of Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles in attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, she continued, is not just a blatant violation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action but also the Charter and international humanitarian law. It also violates resolution 2231 (2015) which prohibits the transfer of all items, materials, goods, equipment and technology from Iran unless approved on a case-by-case basis by the Council. As such, she reiterated her call for an immediate investigation and requested the United Nations experts to inspect the recovered unmanned aerial vehicles of Iranian origin. She further called on all States to stop the transfer of such vehicles, missiles and conventional arms from Iran to the Russian Federation.\n\nAMIR SAEID JALIL IRAVANI ( Iran ) expressed sorrow over the terrorist attack that occurred in his country today and condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Turning to the issue at hand, he said that several Council members, including the United States, have accused Iran of violating resolution 2231 (2015) even though these States continue to violate their legal obligations under that same resolution. The main example is the illegal withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Some States are now attempting to establish \"an entirely artificial linkage\" between Security Council resolution 2231 (2231) and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine by disseminating erroneous information.\n\n\"Iran has never produced or supplied, nor does it intend to produce or supply items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology that could contribute to the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems,\" he said. Any misuse of the function described in note S/2016/44 to conduct a so-called investigation would be illegal and in clear violation of the Secretariat's mandate. Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, Iran has maintained a position of active neutrality, and has emphasized that all Member States must fully respect the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter as well as international law. \"Iran has never provided the parties with weapons for use in the Ukraine conflict,\" he said, rejecting all unfounded allegations made against his country.\n\n__________\n\n* The 9166th meeting was closed.",

                "cc_text": "While Vladimir Putin has imposed martial law in the four occupied Ukrainian regions, his latest decree has also introduced a legal base for an effective economic martial law for all of Russia with the establishment of the Coordination Council headed by the technocrat Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.\n\nbne IntelliNews has analysed how Kremlin is preparing for a protracted conflict and putting the Russian economy on a war footing and warned that the martial law decrees could mean streamlining the federal and private sector resources towards the war efforts in Ukraine.\n\nIndeed, the Council is a special body endowed with broad powers to ensure \"co-operation between the federal executive branch and the regions in resolving issues related to ensuring the needs of the law enforcement agencies during the special military operation [the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine],\" the decree reads as cited by Vedomosti daily.\n\nPM Mishustin will have to report to Putin on the Council's progress on a daily basis. The Council's decisions are binding on federal, regional and municipal authorities and \"other bodies and organisations\", which can also potentially mean any private sector company.\n\nNotably, Mishustin himself mentioned last week that the goals of boosting the military industrial complex output could \"involve business [the private sector]\".\n\nThe Council is free to set its performance targets and implementation deadlines, such as repair of military equipment, provision of medical and sanitary services, repair, construction and engineering works, etc. The Council will also be in charge of distributing the budget for all these purposes.\n\nThe Council will also take responsibility for issues related to the formation of prices of goods and services needed for the war. The board will determine suppliers, contractors and service providers for the provision of goods and services. The board will also oversee implementation of all the supplies.\n\nThe Council headed by PM Mishustin will include six out of the ten deputy prime ministers (including the \"import substitution Czar\" Denis Manturov and \"energy Czar\" Alexander Novak), the Federal Security Bureau (FSB) director Alexander Bortnikov, Federal Tax Service head Daniil Egorov and the head of Russian national guard Rosgvardia head Viktor Zolotov, the Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev, Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Kurenkov, and number of other high-level security officials, including the Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nThe economic bloc on the Council is represented by the presidential aide and ex-EconMin Maxim Oreshkin, currency EconMin Maxim Reshetnikov, the FinMin Anton Siluanov and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin.\n\nNotably, the Council will also assist in building military infrastructure, co-ordination of digitalisation, automation and information-analytical support in the field of defence, including the creation of databases of conscripts.\n\nIn order to do so the Council is granted the right to request materials from authorities of different levels, invite their representatives (and other specialists) to Council meetings, give them instructions, as well as create committees to solve individual issues and propose decisions to the president.\n\nThe high-level officials on the council seem to be personally held responsible by Putin for their contribution to the war efforts, as the decree emphasises that the council members have to participate in all of the meetings \"without the right to be replaced\" (i.e. the transfer of powers to their deputies), Vedomosti notes.\n\nThe lawyers surveyed by the daily note an unprecedented \"supra-governmental\" legal nature of the Council that has the right to override federal and regional authorities and becomes the wartime headquarters. Previously a Co-ordination Council had been set up to deal with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, but it was established by a government decree, and not by Putin.\n\nIn addition, all Russian regions will now have wartime operational headquarters established, overseen by the government with the participation of representatives of security agencies, whose decisions are binding on the regional executive authorities.",

Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times\n\nRussia on Saturday said that it was suspending its participation in an agreement to export grain and other agricultural products from Ukrainian ports, upending a deal that was intended to alleviate a global food crisis.\n\nThe announcement from Russias Defense Ministry came hours after it accused Ukraine of launching an attack on ships from the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea that it said were participating in the grain initiative, which was organized around specific shipping lanes in the Black Sea.\n\nRussia at first said that it had repulsed the attack by Ukrainian drones, but later backtracked and said at least one minesweeper had sustained damage.\n\nGiven the attack, the statement from the Defense Ministry said, \"Russia suspends its participation in the implementation of the agreements on the export of agricultural products from Ukraine.\"\n\nThe suspension will be \"for an indefinite period,\" according to Russias Foreign Ministry. It said in a statement that Russia stood ready to sell its own grain to world markets as a replacement for Ukrainian grain.\n\nThe agreement, known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative, was signed in July and ended a five-month Russian blockade of Ukraines ports. Brokered with Russia and Ukraine by the United Nations and Turkey, the deal was set to expire on Nov. 19. In recent weeks, its future had appeared uncertain.\n\nThe United Nations said Saturday that it was in touch with the Russian authorities regarding the reports that Russia was suspending participation.\n\n\"It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people,\" Stphane Dujarric, the spokesman for Antnio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said.\n\nUkraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government had warned that Russia would try to upend the deal.\n\n\"Now Moscow uses a false pretext to block the grain corridor which ensures food security for millions of people,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"I call on all states to demand Russia to stop its hunger games and recommit to its obligations.\"\n\nAlthough the grain deals primary goal was to end Russias blockade on Ukrainian exports, which had been contributing to a global food crisis, it also allowed for more shipments of Russian grain and fertilizer. As part of the deal, the United States and the European Union gave assurances that banks and companies involved in trading Russian grain and fertilizer would be exempt from sanctions.\n\nIn recent weeks Russia had suggested it might refuse to extend the agreement if Moscows demands over its food and fertilizer exports were not met.\n\nUnder the pact, Ukrainian pilots guide ships through Ukrainian minefields around the ports, and are then given safe passage by the Russian Navy to Turkey, where teams with representatives from all the parties inspect them before they head to delivery ports. Returning ships are also inspected for arms.\n\nCassandra Vinograd contributed reporting.",

Putin said on Oct. 14 that he had not yet made a final decision about whether or not he would go.\n\nIf he does, it will be the first major global summit the Kremlin chief has attended alongside major Western leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden since the war began on Feb. 24.\n\n\"The grain deal will be the centrepiece of this G20 summit and everyone will be trying to convince Putin to extend it, essentially to allow it to roll over or to extend it for longer,\" the European diplomat said.\n\n\"It is a way for the Russians to hold the cards at the G20 summit but a rollover or a longer term extension to the grain deal doesnt cost them anything.\"\n\nThe United Nations-brokered grain deal is crucial for food markets: it allows the export of grain from Ukraine, one of the worlds largest grain exporters, that the Russian invasion had halted.\n\nSince the deal was clinched on July 22, several millions of tonnes of corn, wheat, sunflower products, barley, rapeseed and soya have been exported from Ukraine's Black Sea ports.\n\nLeaders at the G20 will push Putin to extend the deal, the diplomat said. Ultimately, the diplomat said, Russia will allow the deal to rollover for four months - or even go for a longer extension.\n\n\"Russia will take it to the brink but they will extend because they wont want to face the international opprobrium of ending the grain deal,\" the diplomat said.\n\n\"This is the first big event since the war began and every head of state who wants to be a mediator beginning with President Macron will make a beeline for Putins hotel room to be the mediator who convinced Putin to extend the grain deal so Putin will be the kingmaker at this summit.\"\n\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Mark Trevelyan, William Maclean\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "Relationships between leaf hair density and geographical distribution\n\nAe. tauschii is widely distributed in Eurasia, ranging from northern Syria and Turkey to western China, and shows a high degree of genetic variation among populations and individuals35,36,37,38. In this study, LHD in most accessions collected from the western portion was higher than in accessions collected from the east. In other words, LHD was higher in TauL2 than in TauL1 accessions (Table S1, Fig. 2). However, LHD was also high in TauL1 accessions originating from Azerbaijan and Iran. Interestingly, LHDs in TauL3 accessions were intermediate (Table S1, Fig. 2). These results suggest that the geographic variation in Ae. tauschii for LHD could be due to the eastward expansion.\n\nFurthermore, the weak correlations between TauL1 and TauL2 in LHD indicate the independent evolution of LHD in these two lineages. The intermediate LHD in TauL3 further supports the previous reports that this lineage might result from hybridization between TauL1 and TauL2.\n\nDue to the distribution of the waxy bloom allele in Ae. tauschii populations originating from the southwestern Caspian Sea, Iran, and nearby mountains in Azerbaijan; these populations are believed to be the source of the D genome of bread wheat39. Thus, accessions from harsh environments could be a potential source for traits enhancing wheat's biotic and abiotic stress adaptation. Our results clearly show that LHD has spread eastward from the western range of Ae. tauschii were consistent with the study of Morihiro and Takumi31. On the other hand, the high LHD in TauL1 accessions from Iran and Azerbaijan suggests a relationship between the environment and the increased LHD.\n\nGWAS of leaf hair density in TauL1 and TauL2\n\nGWAS for LHD was conducted using association mapping panels consisting of 175 accessions belonging to TauL1 and 113 accessions belonging to TauL230. We identified 3 and 8 MTAs in TauL1 and TauL2, respectively (Table 2, Figs. 3, 4). The R2 values for LHD were higher in TauL2 than in TauL1 (Table 2). We identified four MTAs in TauL2 for which the R2 was greater than 31%. Furthermore, the p-values of the TauL2-specific MTAs were more significant than those obtained for TauL1 or all accessions (Fig. 3df). This result is consistent with the lineage-specific differences observed for LHD among accessions.\n\nSeveral previous studies have reported on LH-related loci in bread wheat. One gene, reported on chromosome 4DL (QHl.ipk-4D), was introduced from Ae. tauschii23. Using the entire Ae. tauschii population we found an MTA on chromosome 4D with minor effect that might correspond to the same region identified previously. However, the GWAS in TauL1 and TauL2 did not detect this QTL. This result could be attributed to the low frequency of the associated allele in the independent populations.\n\nThis study identified three major MTAs on Ae. tauschii chromosome 2D in the TauL1 lineage and eight major MTAs, two each on chromosomes 2D, 3D, 5D, and 7D (R2 = 1136%) in the TauL2 lineage. Most of the markers we identified are associated with stress response genes (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), and we did not find any MTAs previously implicated in regulating LHD.\n\nInterestingly, MTAs on chromosomes 3D, 5D and 7D were specifically detected in TauL2 and not TauL1 (Table 2, Fig. 4). These three QTLs should contribute to the intraspecific variation of the LH morphology in TauL2. The TauL2 accessions possessed higher LHD than the TauL1 accessions, so the TauL2 intraspecific variation could be mainly due to the genetic differences in the 2D QTL regions having the main contribution and the additive effect of the 3D, 5D, and 7D QTLs region that contribute to the subspecies' morphological differentiation. Recently in rice Hamaoka et al. 40 reported that the elongation of the macro-hairs through the epidermal cell differentiation is genetically independent of the short macro-hairs on small vascular bundles. In other words, the hair's presence is independent of the density and length, which is also influenced by the environment40. Considering our findings and the other reports, the evolution of the LHD in the Ae. tauschii lineages can be attributed to the environment prevailing in each lineage distribution range since TauL1 accessions co-exist with TauL2 accessions in the western range have higher LHD than those exist in the eastern part of the lineage range.\n\nMany QTLs for LH traits have been detected on various chromosomes of common wheat15,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,28, whereas the 2D and 5D QTLs detected in the present study might be novel. QTLs on the 4D and 7D homoeologous loci are already found on common wheat's B genome. However, fine mapping of these QTLs is required to elucidate their association. Furthermore, the production of wheat multiple synthetic derivatives (MSD) will provide an excellent chance to confirm the expression of these QTLs in the bread wheat genome as reported by Gorafi et al. 41.\n\nImportance of Ae. tauschii alleles regulating LHD for wheat breeding\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated that LHD contributes to resistance and tolerance to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses42 as well as grain yield and spike weight32. Identifying the genetic loci controlling LHD in wheat is a promising approach to improving agronomic performance under biotic and abiotic stresses. Previous studies identified genes underlying LH traits in wheat, barley, and rye. In specific accessions of Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides, the hairy leaf sheath trait is determined by complementary genes43, but their chromosomal locations are unknown. These genes play essential roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses in wheat. Ae. tauschii has been used to create synthetic hexaploid wheat by crossing with tetraploid wheat (T. turgidum ssp. durum) and subsequent chromosome doubling. Synthetic wheat represents a readily accessible germplasm pool for wheat breeding as it can enhance the variation available in bread wheat44,45. Although Ae. tauschii accessions have a hairy leaf sheath and common wheat is usually glabrous15, LH genes are expressed in the hexaploid genetic background15.\n\nLH-related traits in Ae. tauschii were transferred to common wheat varieties selected from crosses making use of synthetic hexaploid wheat46,47,48,49. Our study found that IG 127025, IG 46623, IG 47188, IG 47203, KU-2083, KU-2092, and KU-2093 are accessions with high LHDs. These accessions were also identified as having high LHDs in the study conducted by Morihiro and Takumi31. These accessions belong to the TauL2 lineage, which originated from the southwestern Caspian Sea region. With the anticipated pressures of climate change expected to increase environmental stresses on crops, genetic stocks exhibiting high LHD will be useful to widen the narrow genetic base of wheat germplasm to increase resistance to various stresses. Our results clearly show that TauL1 and TauL2 regulate LHD using distinct genes, suggesting an independent evolution in each lineage.\n\nMoreover, as reported by Tsunewaki et al.50, the origin of common wheat is restricted to a narrow distribution range within the western habitats of Ae. tauschii, and the D-genome donor accessions putatively belong to TauL2 or undiscovered populations51. Thus, the 2D and 5D QTLs might not have been integrated into the common wheat genome28,52.\n\nRecently, Zhou et al.53 developed a platform to introduce genetic variations from 278 Ae. tauschii accessions into wheat by combining speed breeding and high-throughput genotyping and phenotyping. Their results provide valuable resources for new gene discovery, genotyping, wheat improvement, and resource utilization. On the other hand, Kumar et al.54 established a k-mer-based association mapping pipeline on a diverse panel of 242 Ae. tauschii accessions and identified a QTL for LH on chromosome 4DL that corresponds to the QTL identified by Dobrovolskaya et al.23. They reported that an uncharacterized Ae. tauschii lineage contributed to the initial gene flow into domesticated wheat and understanding the evolution of bread wheat will facilitate the discovery of useful genetic variation from Ae. tauschii. Although all these studies provide valuable information using powerful genomic techniques, understanding the wheat evolution should address the evolution of Ae. tauschii belongs to different lineages. This study and our previous studies (Mahjoob et al.30,36) investigated the traits and genomic regions associated with lineages differences for more efficient utilization of the tremendous resources of Ae. tauschii in wheat breeding to biotic and abiotic stress tolerance.",

                "cc_text": "Greetings and welcome to EURACTIVs Green Brief. Below youll find the latest roundup of news covering energy & environment from across Europe. You can subscribe to the weekly newsletter here.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron made international news headlines when he announced after an EU summit on Friday that France would leave the Energy Charter Treaty, an international agreement meant to safeguard energy investments, including those in fossil fuels.\n\nFor some, Frances decision to withdraw was the final nail in the coffin of the treaty, which was conceived in the 1990s at a time when oil and gas majors were looking to shield their investments from political instability in the former Soviet Union.\n\nLike the Netherlands, Spain, and Poland, which also announced their intention to withdraw earlier, Macron explained his decision by underlining the ECTs misalignment with modern-day objectives, like the fight against climate change, which implies ditching fossil fuels as quickly as possible.\n\nBut the ECT was conceived precisely to survive political mood swings, including those created by politicians desire to go green.\n\nAt the centre of the treaty is a \"sunset clause\", which extends the validity of the ECTs provisions to investments for 20 years after the date of withdrawal.\n\nIn other words, withdrawing from the treaty will do nothing to lift the protection for fossil fuel investments for another 20 years, and will leave the departing countries exposed to litigation from energy companies seeking to safeguard their expected benefits.\n\nIts Halloween season, so lets call this the zombie clause.\n\nEnvironmental activists, who hate the treaty most, have called for a coordinated withdrawal of all EU member states and the EU itself as the best solution to circumvent the zombie clause.\n\nSince most litigation cases are filed by companies in the EU, they argue that the clause can be neutralised with an intra-EU agreement. They also point to a 2021 ruling by the European Court of Justice, which stipulates that the ECT cannot be used in lawsuits between EU countries.\n\nThis would address about 80-90% of all investor-state disputes brought under the ECT, said Paul de Clerck, a green campaigner with Friends of the Earth Europe.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee that the EU can effectively neutralise the sunset clause. Like a zombie rising from the dead, the clause can raise its ugly head during litigation cases brought before private arbitration tribunals appointed under the ECT.\n\n\"The problem is that the ECT is interpreted by arbitrators when there is a dispute. And arbitrators have tended so far to completely ignore what the European Commission says and what the European Court of Justice says,\" said a source familiar with the treatys reform process.\n\nAn even bigger problem could be Article 16 of the ECT. Under that clause, any subsequent agreement passed among ECT members \"does not apply if it lowers the level of protection for investors,\" the source explained.\n\nThis little-known non-regression clause, which the source described as \"fairly obscure\" and \"very powerful\", means energy investments including those in fossil fuels would be shielded from subsequent agreements passed between ECT countries, including those aimed at protecting the environment.\n\nMoreover, even if the European Union and its member states were to leave the treaty at once, they would still be exposed to litigation cases brought by companies headquartered in places like Switzerland, the UK, or Japan, which are still members of the ECT.\n\nThis is why the European Commission is still convinced that finalising the treatys modernisation process is the best option for the EU.\n\nIn June, after years of negotiation, the EU executive announced a hard-won deal to carve out fossil fuels from the ECT, under which existing oil, gas and coal assets would enjoy legal protection for another 10 years instead of the 20 years guaranteed under the zombie clause.\n\nIt may not be ideal but it is the best deal on offer, the Commission argued at the time, pointing out that unanimity is needed to pass the reform among the treatys 53 signatories.\n\n\"This has been one of the main reasons that the Commission, together with the member states, opted for modernisation in the first place. In case of withdrawal, the risk of further claims from existing investors, including on fossil fuels, remains,\" the European Commission told EURACTIV in emailed comments.\n\nBesides, leaving the ECT would also deprive European energy companies of investment protection in other parts of the world, warned Irina Kustova, a researcher at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) in Brussels.\n\n\"For the rest of this decade, investment in alternatives to Russian fossil fuels will remain vital, as does reliable and uninterrupted transit via the southern gas corridor, which is also covered by the Treatys transit provisions,\" she wrote in a recent commentary.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, countries like China or Turkey could use the political vacuum left by the EUs departure from the ECT to strengthen their presence in the South Caucasus and Central Asia, Kustova warned.\n\nGermany, which has not yet spoken out publicly on the ECT, may be sensitive to this argument and has reserved its judgement until after the ECT conference on 22 November, which is expected to endorse the treatys modernisation.\n\nAnd so is a majority of EU member states, which have so far expressed their preference for reforming the ECT rather than leaving.\n\nThe stakes are high. If the EU fails to ratify the modernised treaty, the old one including the fossil fuel provisions hated by Europe will continue to apply for another 20 years.\n\nBeware of the zombie treaty.\n\nFrdric Simon\n\nNote: Its Halloween season so the author of this Green Brief feels obliged to delight you with a classic song from a cult 1980s metal band aptly named Death.

Although renewables are essential to the energy transition and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they are \"far from immune\" to human rights violations that have plagued the fossil fuel industry, according to a new report.\n\nIf not addressed, these can cause project delays, community conflict and ballooning costs for investors, according to research by the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, a charity registered in the UK and the US.\n\n\"When investors fail to consider human rights an essential part of the energy transition, they expose themselves and their portfolio companies to reputational risk and legal and financial costs,\" said Jessie Cato from the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre.\n\nIn the hydropower sector, 22% of all individual allegations of abuse related to land rights, a number that reaches 23% in the wind sector. Across the globe, most attacks against indigenous rights defenders were related to hydropower projects (331 attacks), followed by wind (34 attacks), solar (15 attacks), geothermal (8 attacks) and biofuels (1 attack).\n\nWindEurope, an industry association, did not deny that human rights violations may be taking place but said the vast majority of those occur outside Europe. \"The only case featuring indigenous communities in Europe we are aware of is a case on onshore wind in Norway,\" said Christoph Zipf from WindEurope. To address the issue, the wind industry has adopted some guiding principles for companies in the supply chain, which sets standards for company behaviour, including on the consultation of local communities, Zipf said.

The text was provided to reporters covering the event. Follow Nikkei Asia's in-depth coverage of Chinese politics here.\n\n\"Hold High the Great Banner of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics and Strive in Unity to Build a Modern Socialist Country in All Respects\"\n\n\"Comrades,\n\nOn behalf of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), I will now deliver a report to the 20th National Congress.\n\nThe 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China is a meeting of great importance. It takes place at a critical time as the entire Party and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups embark on a new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects and advance toward the Second Centenary Goal.\n\nThe theme of this Congress is holding high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, fully implementing the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, carrying forward the great founding spirit of the Party, staying confident and building strength, upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground, forging ahead with enterprise and fortitude, and striving in unity to build a modern socialist country in all respects and advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts.\n\nSince its founding a century ago, the Communist Party of China has taken a remarkable journey. Our Party has dedicated itself to achieving lasting greatness for the Chinese nation and committed itself to the noble cause of peace and development for humanity. Our responsibility is unmatched in importance, and our mission is glorious beyond compare. It is imperative that all of us in the Party never forget our original aspiration and founding mission, that we always stay modest, prudent, and hard-working, and that we have the courage and ability to carry on our fight. We must remain confident in our history, exhibit greater historical initiative, and write an even more magnificent chapter for socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.\n\nI. The Work of the Past Five Years and the Great Changes in the First Decade of the New Era\n\nThe five years since the 19th National Congress have been truly momentous and extraordinary. The Party Central Committee has pursued a strategy of national rejuvenation amid global changes of a magnitude not seen in a century. It has convened seven plenary sessions, at which it adopted decisions and resolutions on major issues such as revising China's Constitution, deepening reform of Party and state institutions, upholding and improving the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernizing China's system and capacity for governance, formulating the 114th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives through the Year 2035, and conducting a thorough review of the Party's major achievements and historical experience over the past century. At these sessions, major strategic plans were also made for advancing the cause of the Party and the country. The Central Committee has brought together the entire Party, the military, and the Chinese people and led them in effectively responding to grave, intricate international developments and a series of immense risks and challenges. With great effort and determination, we have steadily advanced socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.\n\nOver the past five years, we have continued to strengthen the overall leadership of the Party and the centralized, unified leadership of the Central Committee. We have devoted great energy to finishing building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. We have fully and faithfully applied the new development philosophy on all fronts, focused on promoting high-quality development, and worked to create a new pattern of development. We have pursued reform at a swift and steady pace, made solid progress in developing whole-process people's democracy, and advanced law-based governance across all fields of endeavor. We have actively developed advanced socialist culture. We have ensured and improved public wellbeing as a matter of priority and pooled resources to wage a critical battle against poverty. We have made a big push to enhance ecological conservation. We have worked with firm resolve to safeguard national security, fended off and defused major risks, and ensured social stability. We have devoted great energy to modernizing our national defense and the armed forces. We have conducted major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics on all fronts. And we have made sweeping efforts to advance the great new project of Party building.\n\nWe celebrated the centenary of the Communist Party of China and the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We adopted the third resolution concerning the Party's history, organized Party-wide activities to study Party history, and inaugurated the Museum of the Communist Party of China. We called upon all Party members to study and apply the great founding spirit of the Party, and we encouraged them to create a brighter future by staying true to the Party's founding mission with greater resolve and purpose on the new journey ahead.\n\nIn responding to the sudden outbreak of Covid-19, we put the people and their lives above all else, worked to prevent both imported cases and domestic resurgences, and tenaciously pursued a dynamic zero-Covid policy. In launching an all-out people's war to stop the spread of the virus, we have protected the people's health and safety to the greatest extent possible and made tremendously encouraging achievements in both epidemic response and economic and social development.\n\nIn the face of turbulent developments in Hong Kong, the central government exercised its overall jurisdiction over the special administrative region as prescribed by China's Constitution and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was formulated and put into effect, ensuring that Hong Kong is governed by patriots. Thanks to these moves, order has been restored in Hong Kong, marking a major turn for the better in the region. Further headway has been made in developing the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and supporting Hong Kong and Macao in growing their economies, improving living standards, and maintaining stability.\n\nIn response to separatist activities aimed at \"Taiwan independence\" and gross provocations of external interference in Taiwan affairs, we have resolutely fought against separatism and countered interference, demonstrating our resolve and ability to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to oppose \"Taiwan independence.\" We have strengthened our strategic initiative for China's complete reunification and consolidated commitment to the one-China principle within the international community.\n\nConfronted with drastic changes in the international landscape, especially external attempts to blackmail, contain, blockade, and exert maximum pressure on China, we have put our national interests first, focused on internal political concerns, and maintained firm strategic resolve. We have shown a fighting spirit and a firm determination to never yield to coercive power. Throughout these endeavors, we have safeguarded China's dignity and core interests and kept ourselves well-positioned for pursuing development and ensuring security.\n\nOver the past five years, our Party has rallied the people and led them in solving a great number of problems that had long gone unsolved, securing many accomplishments that hold major future significance, and achieving impressive advances in the cause of the Party and the country.Comrades,Ten years have passed since the Party's 18th National Congress. The past decade marked three major events of great immediate importance and profound historical significance for the cause of the Party and the people: We embraced the centenary of the Communist Party of China; we ushered in a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics; and we eradicated absolute poverty and finished building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, thus completing the First Centenary Goal. These were historic feats - feats accomplished by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people striving in unity, feats that will be forever recorded in the Chinese nation's history, and feats that will profoundly influence the world.\n\nA decade ago this was the situation we faced:\n\nGreat achievements had been secured in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, and notable advances had been made in the great new project of Party building. All this had created solid foundations, favorable conditions, and key underpinnings for our continued progress.At the same time, however, a number of prominent issues and problems-some of which had been building for years and others which were just emerging- demanded urgent action.\n\nInside the Party, there were many issues with respect to upholding the Party's leadership, including a lack of clear understanding and effective action as well as a slide toward weak, hollow, and watered-down Party leadership in practice. Some Party members and officials were wavering in their political conviction. Despite repeated warnings, pointless formalities, bureaucratism, hedonism, and extravagance persisted in some localities and departments. Privilege-seeking mindsets and practices posed a serious problem, and some deeply shocking cases of corruption had been uncovered.\n\nChina's economy was beset by acute structural and institutional problems. Development was imbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable, and the traditional development model could no longer keep us moving forward. Some deep-seated problems in institutions and barriers built by vested interests were becoming more and more apparent. Some people lacked confidence in the socialist political system with Chinese characteristics, and, all too often, we saw laws being ignored or not being strictly enforced. Misguided patterns of thinking such as money worship, hedonism, egocentricity, and historical nihilism were common, and online discourse was rife with disorder. All this had a grave impact on people's thinking and the public opinion environment.\n\nOur work to ensure the people's wellbeing was fraught with weak links. Tightening resource and environmental constraints and environmental pollution were pronounced. The systems for safeguarding national security were inadequate, and our capacity for responding to various major risks was insufficient. Many shortcomings were affecting the modernization of national defense and the military.\n\nThe institutions and mechanisms for implementing the policy of One Country, Two Systems in Hong Kong and Macao were not well-developed, and China faced grave challenges to its national security.\n\nThese were just some of the problems we faced. Back then, many people, both in and outside of our Party, were worried about the future of the Party and the country.\n\nIn the face of these acute problems and challenges, which undermined the Party's long-term governance, the security and stability of the country, and the wellbeing of the people, the Party Central Committee fully assessed the situation, made resolute decisions, and took firm steps. Under its leadership, the entire Party, the military, and the Chinese people were brought together. We rolled up our sleeves and got down to work, forging ahead with resolve to carry out a great struggle with many new features of our times.\n\nOver the past decade, we have stayed committed to Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, and we have fully implemented the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as well as the Party's basic line and basic policy. We have adopted a number of strategic measures, developed a range of transformative practices, and made a series of breakthroughs and landmark advances. We have withstood risks, challenges, and trials in the political, economic, ideological, and natural domains, secured historic achievements and seen historic changes in the cause of the Party and the country, and taken China on a new journey toward building a modern socialist country in all respects.\n\n- We have established the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. In doing so, we have laid out the basic policy for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, put forward a series of new ideas, new thinking, and new strategies on national governance, and achieved a new breakthrough in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of our times. We have endeavored to use this new theory to arm ourselves intellectually, guide our practice, and advance our work. This theory provides us with fundamental guidance for advancing the cause of our Party and our country in the new era.\n\n- We have strengthened Party leadership in all respects. We have made clear that the leadership of the Communist Party of China is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the greatest strength of the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, that the Party is the highest force of political leadership, and that upholding the centralized, unified leadership of the Party Central Committee is the highest political principle. We have made systematic improvements to the Party's leadership systems. All Party members have become more conscious of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment with the central Party leadership. They have become more purposeful in closely following the Party Central Committee in thinking, political stance, and action, and they have continued to improve their capacity for political judgment, thinking, and implementation. All this has ensured the Party Central Committee's authority and its centralized, unified leadership and guaranteed that the Party fulfills its core role of exercising overall leadership and coordinating the efforts of all sides. Now, our Marxist party of over 96 million members enjoys greater unity and solidarity than ever.\n\n- We have developed well-conceived and complete strategic plans for advancing the cause of the Party and the country in the new era. We have put forward the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and proposed promoting national rejuvenation through a Chinese path to modernization. We have made well-coordinated efforts to advance our great struggle, our great project, our great cause, and our great dream. We have adopted the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy as well as the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, and we have worked to both pursue development and safeguard security. We have identified the principal contradiction - facing Chinese society as that between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's ever-growing needs for a better life, and we have made it clear that closing this gap should be the focus of all our initiatives. With these efforts, we have made constant progress in enriching and developing a new form of human advancement.\n\n- We have achieved moderate prosperity, the millennia-old dream of the Chinese nation, through persistent hard work. With this, we have elevated China to a higher historical starting point in development. By galvanizing the entire nation to carry out targeted poverty alleviation, we have won the largest battle against poverty in human history. A total of 832 impoverished counties and close to 100 million poor rural residents have been lifted out of poverty, and, among them, more than 9.6 million poverty-stricken people have been relocated from inhospitable areas. We have, once and for all, resolved the problem of absolute poverty in China, making significant contributions to the cause of global poverty reduction.\n\n- We have put forward and applied a new development philosophy, worked hard to promote high-quality development, and pushed to foster a new pattern of development. We have carried out supply-side structural reform, formulated a series of major regional strategies important to China's overall development, and brought about a historic rise in China's economic strength.\n\nIn the past decade, China's GDP has grown from 54 trillion yuan to 114 trillion yuan to account for 18.5 percent of the world economy, up 7.2 percentage points. China has remained the world's second largest economy, and its per capita GDP has risen from 39,800 yuan to 81,000 yuan. It ranks first in the world in terms of grain output, and it has ensured food and energy security for its more than 1.4 billion people. The number of permanent urban residents has grown by 11.6 percentage point~ to account for 64.7 percent of the population. China's manufacturing sector is the largest in the world, as are its foreign exchange reserves. China has built the world's largest networks of high-speed railways and expressways and made major achievements in building airports, ports, and water conservancy, energy, information, and other infrastructure.\n\nWe have accelerated efforts to build our self-reliance and strength in science and technology, with nationwide R&D spending rising from 1 trillion yuan to 2.8 trillion yuan, the second highest in the world. Our country is now home to the largest cohort of R&D personnel in the world.\n\nWe have grown stronger in basic research and original innovation, made breakthroughs in some core technologies in key fields, and boosted emerging strategic industries. We have witnessed major successes on multiple fronts, including manned spaceflight, lunar and Martian exploration, deep sea and deep earth probes, supercomputers, satellite navigation, quantum information, nuclear power technology, airliner manufacturing, and biomedicine. China has joined the ranks of the world's innovators.\n\n- We have comprehensively deepened reform with tremendous political courage. We have carried out critical tasks and enhanced top-level design for reform. We have dared to brave uncharted waters, take on tough problems, navigate potential dangers, and face new issues and challenges. We have broken the shackles of stale thinking, torn down barriers erected by vested interests, and removed institutional obstacles in all areas. This has enabled us to put in place foundational institutional frameworks in all sectors, to achieve historic, systemic, and holistic transformations in many fields, and to complete a new round of reform in Party and state institutions. The system of socialism with Chinese characteristics has become more mature and well-defined, and China's system and capacity for governance have been further modernized.\n\n- We have pursued a more proactive strategy of opening up. We have worked to build a globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas and accelerated the development of pilot free trade zones and the Hainan Free Trade Port. As a collaborative endeavor, the Belt and Road Initiative has been welcomed by the international community both as a public good and a cooperation platform. China has become a major trading partner for more than 140 countries and regions, it leads the world in total volume of trade in goods, and it is a major destination for global investment and a leading country in outbound investment. Through these efforts, we have advanced a broader agenda of opening up across more areas and in greater depth.\n\n- We have kept to the path of socialist political advancement with Chinese characteristics. We have comprehensively developed whole-process people's democracy, made all-around progress in improving the institutions, standards, and procedures of our socialist democracy, and advanced socialist consultative democracy by way of extensive participation. We have reinforced the foundations that undergird the people's running of the country, injected fresh vitality into democracy at the community level, and consolidated and expanded the patriotic united front. We have made new accomplishments in promoting ethnic unity and progress, fully implemented the Party's basic policy on religious affairs, and provided better protections for human rights. We have intensified efforts to advance socialist rule of law in our country, and a comprehensive framework for law-based governance has taken shape. We have sped up work on developing the system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics. We have made major progress in reforming the judicial system, thus providing more effective protection for social fairness and justice. These efforts have opened new ground for advancing the rule of law in China.\n\n- We have established and upheld a foundational system for ensuring the guiding role of Marxism in the ideological domain. The Party's new theory for the new era has been embraced by the people, the core socialist values are resonating with the public, fine traditional Chinese culture is undergoing creative transformation and development, cultural programs are flourishing, and the online environment has seen continuous improvement. All this has brought overarching and fundamental changes in China's ideological landscape.\n\nWe celebrated the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the 40th anniversary of the launch of reform and opening up, the 70th anniversary of victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the global war against fascism, and the 70th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure for Korea to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics were a great success. Our young people are filled with greater optimism and enterprise, and there is a notably stronger sense of cultural confidence and a higher level of morale throughout the Party and the nation.\n\n- We have implemented a people-centered philosophy of development. We have worked continuously to ensure people's access to childcare, education, employment, medical services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, thus bringing about an all-around improvement in people's lives. China's average life expectancy has reached 78.2 years, its per capita disposable annual income has risen from 16,500 yuan to 35,100 yuan, and more than 13 million urban jobs have been created each year on average over the past 10 years. We have built the largest education, social security, and healthcare systems in the world. These achievements have allowed us to make historic strides in making education universally available, bring 1.04 billion people under the coverage of basic old-age insurance, and ensure basic medical insurance for 95 percent of the population. Timely adjustments have been made to the childbirth policy. More than 42 million housing units in run-down urban areas and more than 24 million dilapidated rural houses have been rebuilt, marking a significant improvement in housing conditions in both urban and rural areas. The number of internet users has reached 1.03 billion. We have ensured a more complete and lasting sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security for our people, and we have made further progress in achieving common prosperity for all.\n\n- We have acted on the idea that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets. We have persisted with a holistic and systematic approach to conserving and improving mountain, water, forest, farmland, grassland, and desert ecosystems, and we have ensured stronger ecological conservation and environmental protection across the board, in all regions, and at all times. China's ecological conservation systems have been improved, the critical battle against pollution has been advanced, and solid progress has been made in promoting green, circular, and low-carbon development. This has led to historic, transformative, and comprehensive changes in ecological and environmental protection and has brought us bluer skies, greener mountains, and cleaner waters.\n\n- We have applied a holistic approach to national security. We have steadily improved the leadership, legal, strategy, and policy systems for national security. We have not yielded any ground on matters of principle, and we have resolutely safeguarded China's sovereignty, security, and development interests. National security has thus been strengthened on all fronts. We have further improved the social governance system based on collaboration, participation, and shared benefits. We have effectively contained ethnic separatists, religious extremists, and violent terrorists and secured important progress in the campaigns to combat and root out organized crime. We have responded effectively to major natural disasters. The Peaceful China Initiative has entered a new stage.\n\n- We have set the Party's goal of building a strong military in the new era. We have implemented the Party's thinking on strengthening the military for the new era, followed the military strategy for the new era, and upheld absolute Party leadership over the people's armed forces. We held a meeting on military political work in Gutian in 2014 and improved political conduct through rectification initiatives. Having established combat effectiveness as the sole criterion, we have acted with resolve to focus the entire military's attention on combat readiness. We have coordinated efforts to strengthen military work in all directions and domains and devoted great energy to training under combat conditions. We have carried out bold reforms of national defense and the armed forces, restructuring the military leadership and command systems, the modern armed forces system, and the military policy system. We have moved faster to modernize our national defense and the armed forces and reduced the number of active service personnel by 300,000. With new systems, a new structure, a new configuration, and a new look, the people's armed forces have become a much more modern and capable fighting force, and the Chinese path to building a strong military is growing ever broader.\n\n- We have fully and faithfully implemented the policy of One Country, Two Systems. We have upheld the policy of One Country, Two Systems, under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong and the people of Macao administer Macao, both with a high degree of autonomy. We have helped Hong Kong enter a new stage in which it has restored order and is set to thrive, and we have seen both Hong Kong and Macao maintain good momentum for long-term stability and development. We have put forward an overall policy framework for resolving the Taiwan question in the new era and facilitated cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation. We have resolutely opposed separatist activities aimed at \"Taiwan independence\" and foreign interference. We have thus maintained the initiative and the ability to steer in cross-Strait relations.\n\n- We have pursued major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics on all fronts. We have promoted the development of a human community with a shared future and stood firm in protecting international fairness and justice. We have advocated and practiced true multilateralism. We have taken a clear-cut stance against hegemonism and power politics in all their forms, and we have never wavered in our opposition to unilateralism, protectionism, and bullying of any kind. We have improved China's overall diplomatic agenda and worked actively to build a global network of partnerships and foster a new type of international relations. We have demonstrated China's sense of duty as a responsible major country, actively participating in the reform and development of the global governance system and engaging in all-around international cooperation in the fight against Covid-19. All this has seen us win widespread international recognition. China's international influence, appeal, and power to shape have risen markedly.\n\n- We have made significant advances in exercising full and rigorous Party self-governance. Guided by the belief that it takes a good blacksmith to forge good steel, we kicked off our efforts by formulating and implementing the central Party leadership's eight-point decision on improving conduct. We have put forward and implemented the general requirements for strengthening the Party in the new era. We have set strengthening ourselves politically as the overarching guide for all other initiatives of Party building, and we have made sure that our ideological work is aligned with our institution building efforts. Intraparty political activities have been conducted in earnest, and we have continued to carry out intensive education initiatives. We have formulated and implemented the Party's organizational line for the new era and placed an emphasis on political commitment in selecting and appointing officials. Political inspections have been strengthened, and a sound system of Party regulations has taken shape. These moves have enabled the entire Party to maintain firm ideals and convictions and have strengthened the Party's organizational system and tightened discipline and rules.\n\nWe have worked ceaselessly to improve Party conduct and enforce Party discipline. We have hammered away at the task of rectifying pointless formalities, bureaucratism, hedonism, and extravagance; opposed privilege-seeking mindsets and practices; and taken strong action to address misconduct and corruption that occur at people's doorsteps. Thanks to these efforts, unhealthy tendencies that had long gone unchecked have been reversed, and deep-seated problems that had plagued us for years have been remedied.\n\nWe have waged a battle against corruption on a scale unprecedented in our history. Driven by a strong sense of mission, we have resolved to \"offend a few thousand rather than fail 1.4 billion\" and to clear our Party of all its ills. We have taken coordinated steps to see that officials do not have the audacity, opportunity, or desire to be corrupt, and we have used a combination of measures to \"take out tigers,\" \"swat flies,\" and \"hunt down foxes,\" punishing corrupt officials of all types. We have achieved an overwhelming victory and fully consolidated the gains in our fight against corruption. All this has helped remove serious hidden dangers in the Party, the country, and the military and ensured that the power granted to us by the Party and the people is always exercised in the interests of the people.\n\nThrough painstaking efforts, the Party has found a second answer to the question of how to escape the historical cycle of rise and fall. The answer is self-reform. We have significantly boosted the Party's ability to purify, improve, renew, and excel itself, addressed the problem of lax and weak self-governance in Party organizations at the root, and steadily fostered and developed a political atmosphere of integrity within the Party. By doing so, we have ensured that the Party will never change its nature, its conviction, or its character.\n\nAs we fully affirm the remarkable achievements we have made in the cause of the Party and the country, we must not lose sight of the shortcomings in our work and the many difficulties and problems confronting us. They are mainly as follows:\n\nImbalances and inadequacies in development remain a prominent problem. There are many bottlenecks hindering high-quality development, and China's capacity for scientific and technological innovation is not yet strong enough. Many major issues need to be resolved in order to guard against financial risks and ensure that food, energy, and industrial and supply chains are secure and reliable.\n\nThere are still many tough issues to be addressed in the reform of key areas. Quite a few challenges exist in the ideological domain. There are still wide gaps in development and income distribution between urban and rural areas and between regions. Our people face many difficulties in areas such as employment, education, medical services, childcare, elderly care, and housing. Ecological conservation and environmental protection remain a formidable task.\n\nSome Party members and officials lack a strong sense of responsibility, the capacity to grapple with tough challenges, and the readiness to get down to work. Pointless formalities and bureaucratism remain rather pronounced. Eradicating breeding grounds for corruption is still an arduous task.\n\nWe have already put in place a series of measures to deal with these problems, and we must redouble our efforts to see them fully resolved.\n\nComrades,\n\nThe great achievements of the new era have come from the collective dedication and hard work of our Party and our people. Here, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I express our heartfelt gratitude to all of our Party members, to the people of all ethnic groups, to all other political parties, people's organizations, and patriotic figures from all sectors of society, to our fellow compatriots in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, in Taiwan, and overseas, and to all our friends around the world who have shown understanding and support for China's modernization drive.\n\nThe great transformation over the past 10 years of the new era marks a milestone in the history of the Party, of the People's Republic of China, of reform and opening up, of the development of socialism, and of the development of the Chinese nation. Over the course of a century of endeavor, the Communist Party of China has tempered itself through revolution and grown stronger. It has grown better at providing political leadership, giving theoretical guidance, organizing the people, and inspiring society, all while maintaining a close bond with the people. Throughout the Party's history, as the world has undergone profound changes, it has always remained at the forefront of the times. As we have responded to risks and tests at home and abroad, the Party has always remained the backbone of the nation. And as we have upheld and developed socialism with Chinese characteristics; the Party has always remained a strong leadership core.\n\nThe Chinese people are more inspired than ever to forge ahead, more resolved than ever to work hard, and more confident than ever of securing success. They are filled with a stronger sense of history and initiative. With full confidence, the Communist ~arty of China and the Chinese people are driving the great transformation of the Chinese nation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong. We have advanced reform, opening up, and socialist modernization and have written a new chapter on the miracles of fast economic growth and long-term social stability. China now has more solid material foundations and stronger institutional underpinnings for pursuing development. The rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is now on an irreversible historical course.\n\nScientific socialism is brimming with renewed vitality in 21st-century China. Chinese modernization offers humanity a new choice for achieving modernization. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have provided humanity with more Chinese insight, better Chinese input, and greater Chinese strength to help solve its common challenges and have made new and greater contributions to the noble cause of human peace and development.\n\nII. A New Frontier in Adapting Marxism to the Chinese Context and the Needs of the Times\n\nMarxism is the fundamental guiding ideology upon which our Party and our country are founded and thrive. Our experience has taught us that, at the fundamental level, we owe the success of our Party and socialism with Chinese characteristics to the fact that Marxism works, particularly when it is adapted to the Chinese context and the needs of our times. The sound theoretical guidance of Marxism is the source from which our Party draws its firm belief and conviction and which enables our Party to seize the historical initiative.\n\nAdapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of the times is a process of seeking, revealing, and applying truth. With new changes and practical demands emerging both in and outside of China since the 18th National Congress, there was an urgent need for us to provide in-depth theoretical and practical answers to a series of epochal questions on the cause of the Party and the country as well as the Party's governance of China.\n\nWith the courage to make theoretical explorations and innovations, our Party has, from an entirely new perspective, deepened its understanding of the laws that underlie governance by a communist party, the development of socialism, and the evolution of human society. It has achieved major theoretical innovations, which an~ encapsulated in the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The main elements of this theory are summarized in the 10 affirmations, the 14 commitments, and the 13 areas of achievement that were articulated at the 19th National Congress and the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Party Central Committee, all of which we must adhere to over the long term and continue to enrich and develop.\n\nChinese Communists are keenly aware that only by integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China's specific realities and fine traditional culture and only by applying dialectical and historical materialism can we provide correct answers to the major questions presented by the times and discovered through practice and can we ensure that Marxism always retains its vigor and vitality.\n\nTo uphold and develop Marxism, we must integrate it with China's specific realities. Taking Marxism as our guide means applying its worldview and methodology to solving problems in China; it does not mean memorizing and reciting its specific conclusions and lines, and still less does it mean treating it as a rigid dogma. We must continue to free our minds, seek truth 14 from facts, move with the times, and take a realistic and pragmatic approach. We must base everything we do on actual conditions and focus on solving real problems arising in our reform, opening up, and socialist modernization endeavors in the new era. We must keep responding to the questions posed by China, by the world, by the people, and by the times; in doing so, we should find the right answers suited to the realities of China and the needs of our day, reach conclusions that are compatible with objective laws, and develop new theories that are in step with the times, so as to provide better guidance for China's practice.\n\nTo uphold and develop Marxism, we must integrate it with China's fine traditional culture. Only by taking root in the rich historical and cultural soil of the country and the nation can the truth of Marxism flourish here. With a history stretching back to antiquity, China's fine traditional culture is extensive and profound; it is the crystallization of the wisdom of Chinese civilization. Our traditional culture espouses many important principles and concepts, including pursuing common good for all; regarding the people as the foundation of the state; governing by virtue; discarding the outdated in favor of the new; selecting officials on the basis of merit; promoting harmony between humanity and nature; ceaselessly pursuing self-improvement; embracing the world with virtue; acting in good faith and being friendly to others; and fostering neighborliness. These maxims, which have taken shape over centuries of work and life, reflect the Chinese people's way of viewing the universe, the world, society, and morality and are highly consistent with the propositions of scientific socialism.\n\nWe must stay confident in our history and culture, make the past serve the present, and develop the new from the old. We must integrate the essence of Marxism with the best of fine traditional Chinese culture and with the common values that our people intuitively apply in their everyday lives. We should keep endowing Marxist theory with distinctive Chinese features and consolidating the historical basis and public support for adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of our times. With this, we will ensure that Marxism puts down deep roots in China.\n\nJust as there are no bounds to practice, there is no end to theoretical innovation. It is the solemn historical responsibility of today's Chinese Communists to continue opening new chapters in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of the times. To keep advancing theoretical innovation on the basis of practical experience, we must, first of all, gain a good command of the worldview and methodology of the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and adhere to and make good use of its stances, viewpoints, and methods.\n\n- We must put the people first. People-centeredness is an essential attribute of Marxism. Our Party's theories are from the people, for the people, and beneficial to the people. The people's creative practices are the inexhaustible source of our theoretical innovations. Theories that are detached from the people will be feeble and ineffective, and theories that cannot deliver for the people will be stale and lifeless. We must stand firmly with the people, respond to their wishes, respect their creativity, and pool their wisdom to develop theories that they like, accept, and adopt and that become powerful tools guiding them in understanding and changing the world.\n\n- We must maintain self-confidence and stand on our own feet. There has never been an instruction manual or ready-made solution for the Chinese people and the Chinese nation to turn to as they fought to end the great sufferings endured since the advent of modern times and have moved on toward the bright future of rejuvenation. The Party has led the people in independently blazing the path to success over the past century, and the success of Marxism in China has been realized by Chinese Communists through our own endeavors. One point underpinning these successes is that China's issues must be dealt with by Chinese people in light of the Chinese context. We must remain firm in our conviction in Marxism and socialism with Chinese characteristics and strengthen our confidence in the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics. With a stronger sense of historical responsibility and creativity, we should make greater contributions to the development of Marxism. We should never act blindly without assessing how conditions have evolved or allow ourselves to become ossified or closed off, nor should we mechanically imitate others or indiscriminately absorb foreign ideas.\n\n- We must uphold fundamental principles and break new ground. We are advancing a great cause that none have attempted before. Only by upholding fundamental principles can we avoid losing our bearings or making catastrophic mistakes. Only by breaking new ground can we meet the call of the day and shape the trends of our times. We should approach Marxism with a respect for science and in the spirit of seeking truth. We must never waver in upholding the basic tenets of Marxism, the overall leadership of the Party, and socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should keep pace with the times and adapt to the evolution of practice. We should approach each and every new thing with great enthusiasm and never stop broadening and deepening our understanding of the world. We must dare to say what has never been said and do what has never been done, and we must use new theory to guide new practice.\n\n- We must adopt a problem-oriented approach. Problems represent the voice of the times. The fundamental task of theory is to respond to problems and provide guidelines for finding solutions. The problems we face today are considerably more complex, and resolving them has become much more difficult. This presents a completely new challenge for theoretical innovation. We must be more conscious of problems, especially new problems that are discovered through practice, deep-seated problems affecting reform, development, and stability, pressing concerns of the people, major issues in the evolving global landscape, and prominent issues we face in Party building. We should keep developing new thinking, new approaches, and new ways to effectively resolve problems.\n\n- We must apply systems thinking. All things are interconnected and interdependent. We must view them with the understanding that they are universally connected, part of a complete system, and constantly evolving if we are to grasp the laws governing their development.\n\nAs a major developing country, China is still in the primary stage of socialism and is going through an extensive and profound social transformation. A small move made to advance reform and development or to adjust interests may affect the bigger picture. We should be able to see the present from a historical perspective, look beyond the surface to get to the crux of issues, and properly manage the relationships between overall and local interests, between the present and the future, between macro and micro concerns, between primary and secondary issues, and between the special and the ordinary. We should improve our ability to adopt a strategic perspective and apply a historical, dialectical, and systematic approach to thinking; we should get better at thinking creatively, thinking in terms of the rule of law, and considering worst-case scenarios. By doing so, we can develop a well-conceived approach to planning and advancing the endeavors of the Party and the country on all fronts in a forward-looking and holistic manner.\n\n- We must maintain a global vision. The Communist Party of China is dedicated to pursuing happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. It is also dedicated to human progress and world harmony. We should expand our global vision and develop keen insight into the trends of human development and progress, respond to the general concerns of people of all countries, and play our part in resolving the common issues facing humankind. With an open mind, we should draw inspiration from all of human civilization's outstanding achievements and work to build an even better world.\n\nIII. The New Journey of the New Era: Missions and Tasks of the Communist Party of China\n\nFrom this day forward, the central task of the Communist Party of China will be to lead the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in a concerted effort to realize the Second Centenary Goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization.\n\nBased on our decades of exploration and practice since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, especially since the launch of reform and opening up in 1978, as well as the new breakthroughs made in theory and practice since the 18th National Congress, we have succeeded in advancing and expanding Chinese modernization.\n\nChinese modernization is socialist modernization pursued under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. It contains elements that are common to the modernization processes of all countries, but it is more characterized by features that are unique to the Chinese context.\n\n- It is the modernization of a huge population. China is working to achieve modernization for more than 1.4 billion people, a number larger than the combined population of all developed countries in the world today. This is a task of unparalleled difficulty and complexity; it inevitably means that our pathways of development and methods of advancement will be unique. We will, as always, bear China's realities in mind as we address issues, make decisions, and take action. We will neither pursue grandiose goals nor go by the rulebook. We will stay patient in advancing the course of history and take steady and incremental steps to sustain progress.\n\n- It is the modernization of common prosperity for all. Achieving common prosperity is a defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and involves a long historical process. The immutable goal of our modernization drive is to meet the people's aspirations for a better life. We will endeavor to maintain and promote social fairness and justice, bring prosperity to all, and prevent polarization.\n\n- It is the modernization of material and cultural-ethical advancement. Material abundance and cultural-ethical enrichment are fundamental goals of socialist modernization. Material want is not socialism, nor is cultural impoverishment. While continuing to consolidate the material foundation for modernization and improve the material conditions for people's wellbeing, we will strive to develop advanced socialist culture, foster strong ideals and convictions, and carry forward China's cultural heritage. We will thus promote all-around material abundance as well as people's well-rounded development.\n\n- It is the modernization of harmony between humanity and nature. Humanity and nature make up a community of life. If we extract from nature without limit or inflict damage on it, we are bound to face its retaliation. China is committed to sustainable development and to the principles of prioritizing resource conservation and environmental protection and letting nature restore itself. We will protect nature and the environment as we do our own lives. We will continue to pursue a model of sound development featuring improved production, higher living standards, and healthy ecosystems to ensure the sustainable development of the Chinese nation.\n\n- It is the modernization of peaceful development. In pursuing modernization, China will not tread the old path of war, colonization, and plunder taken by some countries. That brutal and blood-stained path of enrichment at the expense of others caused great suffering for the people of developing countries. We will stand firmly on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. Dedicated to peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit, we will strive to safeguard world peace and development as we pursue our own development, and we will make greater contributions to world peace and development through our own development.\n\nThe essential requirements of Chinese modernization are as follows: upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China and socialism with Chinese characteristics, pursuing high-quality development, developing whole-process people's democracy, enriching the people's cultural lives, achieving common prosperity for all, promoting harmony between humanity and nature, building a human community with a shared future, and creating a new form of human advancement.\n\nTo build China into a great modern socialist country in all respects, we have adopted a two-step strategic plan:\n\nBasically realize socialist modernization from 2020 through 2035\n\nBuild China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful from 2035 through the middle of this century\n\nChina's overall development objectives for the year 2035 are as follows:\n\nSignificantly increase economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, and composite national strength; substantially grow the per capita GDP to be on par with that of a mid-level developed country\n\nJoin the ranks of the world's most innovative countries, with great self-reliance and strength in science and technology\n\nBuild a modernized economy; form a new pattern of development; basically achieve new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization\n\nBasically modernize the system and capacity for governance; improve the system for whole-process people's democracy; build a law-based country, government, and society\n\nBecome a leading country in education, science and technology, talent, culture, sports, and health; significantly enhance national soft power\n\nEnsure that the people are leading better and happier lives; bring per capita disposable income to new heights; substantially grow the middle-income group as a share of the total population; guarantee equitable access to basic public services; ensure modern standards of living in rural areas; achieve long-term social stability; make more notable and substantive progress in promoting the people's well-rounded development and prosperity for all\n\nBroadly establish eco-friendly ways of work and life; steadily lower carbon emissions after reaching a peak; fundamentally improve the environment; largely accomplish the goal of building a Beautiful China\n\nComprehensively strengthen the national security system and national security capabilities; achieve basic modernization of national defense and the armed forces\n\nAfter basically realizing modernization, we will continue to work hard and build China into a great modern socialist country that leads the world in terms of composite national strength and international influence by the middle of the century.\n\nThe next five years will be crucial for getting our efforts to build a modern socialist country in all respects off to a good start. Our main objectives and tasks for this period are as follows:\n\nMake breakthroughs in promoting high-quality economic development; achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology; make major progress in creating a new pattern of development and building a modernized economy\n\nMake new strides in reform and opening up; make further progress in modernizing China's system and capacity for governance; further improve the socialist market economy; put in place new systems for a higher-standard open economy\n\nFurther enhance the institutions, standards, and procedures of whole-process people's democracy; improve the system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics\n\nEnrich the intellectual and cultural lives of our people; enhance the cohesion of the Chinese nation and the appeal of Chinese culture\n\nEnsure personal income grows basically in step with economic growth and pay rises in tandem with increases in productivity; ensure much more equitable access to basic public services; develop a better multi-tiered social security system\n\nSubstantially improve urban and rural living environments; make notable progress in building a Beautiful China Further consolidate national security; fulfill the goals for the centenary of the People's Liberation Army in 2027; make solid progress in building a Peaceful China\n\nFurther increase China's international standing and influence; enable China to play a greater role in global governance\n\nBuilding a modern socialist country in all respects is a great and arduous endeavor. Our future is bright, but we still have a long way to go. At present, momentous changes of a like not seen in a century are accelerating across the world. A new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation is well under way, and a significant shift is taking place in the international balance of power, presenting China with new strategic opportunities in pursuing development. At the same time, however, the once-in-a-century pandemic has had far-reaching effects; a backlash against globalization is rising; and unilateralism and protectionism are mounting. The global economic recovery is sluggish, regional conflicts and disturbances are frequent, and global issues are becoming more acute. The world has entered a new period of turbulence and change.\n\nAt home, we face many deep-seated problems regarding reform, development, and stability that cannot be avoided or bypassed. In our efforts to strengthen the Party, and especially to improve conduct, build integrity, and combat corruption, we are confronted with many stubborn and recurrent problems. External attempts to suppress and contain China may escalate at any time.\n\nOur country has entered a period of development in which strategic opportunities, risks, and challenges are concurrent and uncertainties and unforeseen factors are rising. Various \"black swan\" and \"gray rhino\" events may occur at any time. We must therefore be more mindful of potential dangers, be prepared to deal with worst-case scenarios, and be ready to withstand high winds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms. On the journey ahead, we must firmly adhere to the following major principles.\n\n-Upholding and strengthening the Party's overall leadership. We must resolutely uphold the Party Central Committee's authority and its centralized, unified leadership and see that Party leadership is exercised in all aspects and every stage of the endeavors of the Party and the country. This will ensure that our Party always remains the pillar that the Chinese people can lean on in times of difficulty, that our socialist modernization advances along the right path, and that we have the political cohesion and confidence in our development to inspire the people to strive in unity. It will see us forming a mighty force to overcome all difficulties with one heart and one mind.\n\n- Following the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must continue to pursue economic development as our central task, uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, remain committed to reform and opening up, and stay independent and self-reliant. We must keep to our path and not sway in our commitment. We must not return to the isolation and rigidity of the past, or veer off course by changing our nature or abandoning our system. We must develop our country and our nation with our own strength, and we must maintain a firm grasp on the future of China's development and progress.\n\n-Applying a people-centered development philosophy. We must protect the people's fundamental interests, improve their wellbeing, and work tirelessly to ensure that development is for the people and by the people and that its fruits are shared by the people. We must do a better job of seeing that the gains of modernization benefit all our people fairly.\n\n- Remaining committed to deepening reform and opening up. We must intensify efforts to advance reform and explore new ground, and we must remain steadfast in expanding opening up. We must work hard to remove deep-seated institutional barriers so as to fully tap into the strengths of socialism with Chinese characteristics and continuously imbue our socialist modernization endeavors with fresh dynamism and vitality. We must do better in translating our country's institutional strengths into effective governance.\n\n- Carrying forward our fighting spirit. We must foster a firmer sense of purpose, fortitude, and self-belief in the whole Party and the Chinese people so that we cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, or cowed by pressure. We must meet obstacles and difficulties head on, ensure both development and security, and dig deep to surmount the difficulties and challenges on the road ahead. Let us harness our indomitable fighting spirit to open up new horizons for our cause.\n\nComrades,\n\nToday, we are closer, more confident, and more capable than ever of reaching the goal of rejuvenating the Chinese nation. At the same time, we must be prepared to work even harder to get there. All of us in the Party must forge ahead with confidence and determination; proactively identify, respond to, and steer changes and prevent and defuse risks; and keep on striving to secure new successes in building a modern socialist China in all respects.\n\nIV. Accelerating the Creation of a New Development Pattern and Pursuing High-Quality Development\n\nTo build a modern socialist country in all respects, we must, first and foremost, pursue high-quality development. Development is our Party's top priority in governing and rejuvenating China, for without solid material and technological foundations, we cannot hope to build a great modern socialist country in all respects. We must fully and faithfully apply the new development philosophy on all fronts, continue reforms to develop the socialist market economy, promote high-standard opening up, and accelerate efforts to foster a new pattern of development that is focused on the domestic economy and features positive interplay between domestic and international economic flows.\n\nPursuing high-quality development as our overarching task, we will make sure that our implementation of the strategy to expand domestic demand is integrated with our efforts to deepen supply-side structural reform; we will boost the dynamism and reliability of the domestic economy while engaging at a higher level in the global economy; and we will move faster to build a modernized economy. We will raise total factor productivity, make China's industrial and supply chains more resilient and secure, and promote integrated urban-rural development and coordinated regional development, so as to effectively upgrade and appropriately expand China's economic output.\n\n1. Building a high-standard socialist market economy\n\nWe must uphold and improve China's basic socialist economic system. We must unswervingly consolidate and develop the public sector and unswervingly encourage, support, and guide the development of the non-public sector. We will work to see that the market plays the decisive role in resource allocation and that the government better plays its role.\n\nWe will deepen reform of state-owned capital and state-owned enterprises (SOEs); accelerate efforts to improve the layout of the state-owned sector and adjust its structure; work to see state-owned capital and enterprises get stronger, do better, and grow bigger; and enhance the core competitiveness of SOEs.\n\nWe will provide an enabling environment for private enterprises, protect their property rights and the rights and interests of entrepreneurs in accordance with the law, and facilitate the growth of the private sector. We will improve the modern corporate system with distinctive Chinese features, encourage entrepreneurship, and move faster to help Chinese companies become world-class outfits. We will support the development of micro, small, and medium enterprises.\n\nWe will intensify reforms to streamline government administration, delegate power, improve regulation, and upgrade services. We will build a unified national market, advance reforms for the market-based allocation of production factors, and put in place a high-standard market system. We will refine the systems underpinning the market economy, such as those for property rights protection, market access, fair competition, and social credit, in order to improve the business environment.\n\nWe will improve the system of macroeconomic governance, give full play to the strategic guidance of national development plans, and enhance coordination between fiscal and monetary policies. We will work to expand domestic demand and better levera.ge the fundamental role of consumption in stimulating economic growth and the key role of investment in improving the supply structure. We will improve the modern budget system, optimize the tax structure, and improve the system of transfer payments.\n\nWe will deepen structural reform in the financial sector, modernize the central bank system, and strengthen and refine modern financial regulation. We will reinforce the systems that safeguard financial stability, place all types of financial activities under regulation according to the law, and ensure no systemic risks arise.\n\nWe will improve the functions of the capital market and increase the proportion of direct financing. We will take stronger action against monopolies and unfair competition, break local protectionism and administrative monopolies, and conduct law-based regulation and guidance to promote the healthy development of capital.\n\n2. Modernizing the industrial system\n\nIn pursuing economic growth, we must continue to focus on the real economy. We will advance new industrialization and move faster to boost 24 China's strength in manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, cyberspace, and digital development. We will carry out industrial foundation reengineering projects and research projects on major technologies and equipment; support enterprises that use special and sophisticated technologies to produce novel and unique products; and move the manufacturing sector toward higher-end, smarter, and greener production.\n\nWe will consolidate our leading position in industries where we excel, work faster to shore up weaknesses in sectors vital to China's development security, and improve our capacity for securing the supply of strategic resources. We will promote the integrated and clustered development of strategic emerging industries and cultivate new growth engines such as next-generation information technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, new energy, new materials, high-end equipment, and green industry.\n\nWe will build a new system of efficient and high-quality services and promote further integration of modern services with advanced manufacturing and modern agriculture. We will accelerate development of the Internet of Things and build an efficient and smooth logistics system to help cut distribution costs.\n\nWe will accelerate the development of the digital economy, further integrate it with the real economy, and build internationally competitive digital industry clusters. We will build a modern infrastructure system with a better layout and structure, more effective functions, and greater system integration.\n\n3. Advancing rural revitalization across the board\n\nThe most challenging and arduous tasks we face in building a modern socialist China in all respects remain in our rural areas. We will continue to put agricultural and rural development first, pursue integrated development of urban and rural areas, and facilitate the flows of production factors between them. We will move faster to build up China's strength in agriculture and steadily promote the revitalization of businesses, talent, culture, ecosystems, and organizations in the countryside.\n\nWe must reinforce the foundations for food security on all fronts. We will ensure that both Party committees and governments assume responsibility for ensuring food security and that China's total area of farmland does not fall below the redline of 120 million hectares. We will work to gradually develop all permanent basic cropland into high-standard cropland.

We will improve the systems for supporting and protecting agriculture and the rural financial services system.\n\n4. Promoting coordinated regional development\n\nWe will thoroughly implement the coordinated regional development strategy, major regional strategies, the functional zoning strategy, and the new urbanization strategy. We will improve the distribution of the major productive forces and develop a regional economic layout and a territorial space system that complement each other's strengths and promote high-quality development.\n\nWe will make further progress in the large-scale development of the western region, achieve new breakthroughs in the full revitalization of the Northeast, accelerate the rise of the central region, and encourage the eastern region to modernize more quickly.\n\nWe will support old revolutionary base areas and areas with large ethnic minority populations in speeding up development.

Invigorating China through Science and Education and Developing a Strong Workforce for the Modernization Drive\n\nEducation, science and technology, and human resources are the foundational and strategic pillars for building a modern socialist country in all respects. We must regard science and technology as our primary productive force, talent as our primary resource, and innovation as our primary driver of growth. We will fully implement the strategy for invigorating China through science and education, the workforce development strategy, and the innovation-driven development strategy. We will open up new areas and new arenas in development and steadily foster new growth drivers and new strengths.\n\nWe will continue to give high priority to the development of education, build China's self-reliance and strength in science and technology, and rely on talent to pioneer and to propel development. We will speed up work to build a strong educational system, greater scientific and technological strength, and a quality workforce. We will continue efforts to cultivate talent for the Party and the country and comprehensively improve our ability to nurture talent at home. All this will see us producing first-class innovators and attracting the brightest minds from all over.\n\n1. Developing education that meets the people's expectations\n\nEducation is of critical importance to the future of our country and our Party. What kind of people we should cultivate, how, and for whom-these are the fundamental issues that education must address.\n\nThe most basic aim of education is to foster virtue. We will fully implement the Party's educational policy, carry out the basic task of fostering virtue through education, and nurture a new generation of capable young people with sound moral grounding, intellectual ability, physical vigor, aesthetic sensibility, and work skills who will fully develop socialism and carry forward the socialist cause.\n\nWe will continue to follow a people-centered approach to developing education, move faster to build a high-quality educational system, advance students' well-rounded development, and promote fairness in education. We will accelerate high-quality, balanced development and urban-rural 2integration in compulsory education. We will better allocate educational resources across regions, strengthen public-benefit preschool education and special needs education, ensure the diversified development of senior secondary schools, and improve the financial aid system so it covers students at all stages of schooling.\n\nWe will promote collaborative innovation in vocational education, higher education, and continuing education and promote integration between vocational education and general education, between industry and education, and between science and education. We will better establish vocational education as a category in the educational system. We will do more to develop basic disciplines, emerging disciplines, and interdisciplinary subjects and speed up the development of world-class universities and strong disciplines with Chinese features. We will better guide and regulate the development of private schools.\n\nWe will intensify efforts to promote standard spoken and written Chinese. We will advance comprehensive reform in education, strengthen the creation and management of teaching materials, refine the systems for school management and educational assessments, and improve mechanisms for school-family-society collaboration in education.\n\nWe will strengthen the professional integrity, conduct, and ability of our teachers, foster public respect for educators, and encourage public support for education. We will promote the digitalization of education and build a society and country of learning where lifelong learning is pursued by all.\n\n2. Improving systems for scientific and technological innovation\n\nInnovation will remain at the heart of China's modernization drive. We will improve the system in which the Party Central Committee exercises unified leadership over science and technology work. We will improve the new system for mobilizing resources nationwide to make key technological breakthroughs. We will boost China's strength in strategic science and technology, better allocate innovation resources, and better define the roles of national research institutes, advanced-level research universities, and leading high-tech enterprises to improve their layout. We will establish a system of national laboratories, coordinate the development of international and regional centers for scientific and technological innovation, enhance basic scientific and technological capacity, and ensure better strategic input from the science and technology sector, so as to boost the overall performance of China's innovation system.\n\nWe will deepen structural scientific and technological reform and reform of the system for appraisal of scientific and technological advances. We will increase investment in science and technology through diverse channels and strengthen legal protection of intellectual property rights, in order to establish a foundational system for all-around innovation. We will nurture a culture of innovation, encourage dedication to science, cultivate fine academic conduct, and foster an enabling environment for innovation.\n\nWe will expand science and technology exchanges and cooperation with other countries, cultivate an internationalized environment for research, and create an open and globally-competitive innovation ecosystem.\n\n3. Accelerating the implementation of the innovation-driven development strategy\n\nSetting our sights on the global frontiers of science and technology, national economic development, the major needs of the country, and the health and safety of the people, we should speed up efforts to achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology.\n\nTo meet China's strategic needs, we will concentrate resources on original and pioneering scientific and technological research to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields. In order to enhance China's innovation capacity, we will move faster to launch a number of major national projects that are of strategic, big-picture, and long-term importance. We will strengthen basic research, prioritize original innovation, and encourage researchers to engage in free exploration.\n\nTo inspire greater creativity, we will invest more effectively in science and technology and advance reform of ,he mechanisms for the allocation and use of government research funds. We will promote closer enterprise-led collaboration between industries, universities, and research institutes, stay goal-oriented, and promote the industrial application of scientific and technological advances. We will reinforce the principal role of enterprises in innovation, give full play to the guiding and supporting role of key high-tech enterprises, create an enabling environment for the growth of micro, small, and medium technological enterprises, and promote deeper integration of the innovation, industrial, capital, and talent chains.\n\n4. Implementing the workforce development strategy\n\nCultivating a large workforce of high-quality talent who have both integrity and professional competence is of critical importance to the long-term development of China and the Chinese nation. A wealth of talent is vital to the success of a great cause. We should follow the principle of the Party managing talent, and we should respect work, knowledge, talent, and creativity. We will adopt more proactive, open, and effective policies on talent and encourage our talent to love the Party, dedicate themselves to the country and contribute to its cause, and serve the people. We will improve the strategic distribution of human resources and make concerted efforts to cultivate talented people in all fields, so as to create a large, well-structured, and high-quality workforce.\n\nWe will move faster to build world hubs for talent and innovation, promote better distribution and balanced development of talent across regions, and strive to build up our comparative strengths in global competition for talent. We will speed up efforts to build a contingent of personnel with expertise of strategic importance and cultivate greater numbers of master scholars, science strategists, first-class scientists and innovation teams, young scientists, outstanding engineers, master craftsmen, and highly-skilled workers.\n\nWe will increase international personnel exchanges and make the best use of talent of all types to fully harness their potential. We will further reform the systems and mechanisms for talent development and ensure we value talented people, nurture them, attract them, and put them to good use. No effort should be spared and no rigid boundaries drawn in the endeavor to bring together the best and the brightest from all fields for the cause of the Party and the people.\n\nVI. Advancing Whole-Process People's Democracy and Ensuring that the People Run the Country\n\nChina is a socialist country of people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the working class based on an alliance of workers and farmers; all power of the state in China belongs to the people. People's democracy is the lifeblood of socialism, and it is integral to our efforts to build a modern socialist country in all respects. Whole-process people's democracy is the defining feature of socialist democracy; it is democracy in its broadest, most genuine, and most effective form.\n\nWe must firmly stay on the path of socialist political advancement with Chinese characteristics, uphold the unity between Party leadership, the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance, and ensure the principal position of the people, so as to give full expression to their will, protect their rights and interests, and spark their creativity.\n\nWe will improve the system of institutions through which the people run the country. We will encourage the people's orderly participation in political affairs and guarantee their ability to engage in democratic elections, consultations, decision-making, management, and oversight in accordance with the law. We will inspire the people's motivation, initiative, and creativity, so as to consolidate and develop a lively, stable, and united political atmosphere.\n\n1. Strengthening the institutions through which the people run the country\n\nWe must uphold and improve our country's foundational, basic, and important political systems, expand democratic channels, and diversify the forms of democracy, so as to ensure that people participate in various ways in the management of state, economic, cultural, and social affairs in accordance with the law.\n\nWe will support and ensure the people's exercise of state power through people's congresses, and we will ensure that people's congresses at all levels are formed through democratic elections, responsible to the people, and subject to their oversight.\n\nWe will support and ensure that people's congresses and their standing committees lawfully exercise the powers of enacting laws, conducting oversight, making decisions, and appointing and removing officials. We will improve the system under which people's congresses conduct oversight of administrative, supervisory, adjudicatory, and procuratorial organs, and we will uphold the unity, sanctity, and authority of the law.\n\nWe will see that deputies to people's congresses are better able to carry out their work and that they strengthen ties with the general public. We will improve working mechanisms for d11awing on public opinion and pooling the wisdom of the people and ensure that local legislative outreach offices are well-run. We will intensify reform and development of trade unions, Chinese Communist Youth League organizations, women's federations, and other people's organizations and give full play to their role as bridges connecting the Party and the people. We will follow a Chinese path of human rights development, actively participate in global human rights governance, and promote all-around advancement of human rights.\n\n2. Fully developing consultative democracy\n\nConsultative democracy is an important way by which whole-process people's democracy is practiced. We will improve the system of consultative democracy, make coordinated efforts to promote consultations carried out by political parties, people's congresses, government departments, committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), people's organizations, communities, and social organizations, and improve various institutional consultative platforms, so as to promote extensive, multilevel, and institutionalized development of consultative democracy.\n\nWe will uphold and improve the system of CPC-led multiparty cooperation and political consultation and ensure the integration of Party leadership, the united front, and consultative democracy. We will give play to the CPPCC's role as a specialized consultative body and see that it coordinates efforts to promote democracy and unity while making proposals on state affairs and building consensus. Improvements will be made to institutions, standards, and procedures to help the CPPCC ensure that in-depth consultations and interactions are conducted, opinions are fully expressed, and broad consensus is built. Efforts will be also made to improve the systems and mechanisms through which CPPCC committees conduct democratic oversight and their members stay engaged with people from various sectors.\n\n3. Actively developing democracy at the primary level\n\nPrimary-level democracy is an important manifestation of whole-process people's democracy. We will improve the mechanism for community-level self-governance under the leadership of primary-level Party organizations, build up the strength of primary-level organizations, and improve the institutional and working systems for direct democracy at the primary level to see that urban and rural communities can more effectively manage, serve, educate, and oversee themselves.\n\nWe will increase transparency in government affairs, establish more channels for people from various sectors to participate in community-level governance in an orderly way, and ensure that the people manage public affairs and run public-interest programs at the primary level in accordance with the law.\n\nWe will rely wholeheartedly on the working class and improve the system of democratic management in enterprises and public institutions, which takes basic shape in the form of workers' congresses, so as to protect workers' lawful rights and interests.\n\n4. Consolidating and developing the broadest possible patriotic united front\n\nThe people's support is of the utmost political importance, and the united front is an effective instrument for rallying the people's support and pooling their strength. We will build a broad united front to forge great unity and solidarity, and we will encourage all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation to dedicate themselves to realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.\n\nWe will leverage the strengths of our country's new type of socialist political party system. Following the principles of long-term coexistence, mutual oversight, sincerity, and sharing the rough times and the smooth, we will strengthen our Party's unity and cooperation with other political parties and prominent figures without party affiliation. We will also support other political parties in improving themselves and performing their roles more effectively.\n\nWe will, with a focus on forging a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation, continue to take the correct and distinctively Chinese approach to handling ethnic affairs, uphold and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and improve the Party's work on ethnic affairs, so as to comprehensively promote ethnic unity and progress. We will remain committed to the principle that religions in China must be Chinese in orientation and provide active guidance to religions so that they can adapt to socialist society. We will strengthen communication with intellectuals who are not Party members on theoretical and political issues and improve our work concerning people from emerging social groups in an effort to provide better political guidance for pursuing common goals.\n\nWe will cultivate a cordial and clean relationship between government and business across the board and facilitate the healthy development of the non-public sector and those working in it.\n\nWe will improve and strengthen our work related to Chinese nationals overseas to give shape to a powerful joint force for advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n\nVII. Exercising Law-Based Governance on All Fronts and Advancing the Rule of Law in China\n\nThe comprehensive advancement of law-based governance has been a profound revolution in China's governance. Law-based governance is important for the Party's success in governing and rejuvenating the country, for the wellbeing of the people, and for the long-term stability of the Party and the country. We must give better play to the role of the rule of law in consolidating foundations, ensuring stable expectations, and delivering long-term benefits, and we must strive to build a modern socialist country in all respects under the rule of law.\n\nWe must follow a path of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics, develop a Chinese system of socialist rule of law, and establish China as a socialist country under the rule of law. We must, with a focus on protecting and promoting social fairness and justice, pursue coordinated progress in law-based governance, law-based exercise of state power, and law-based 34 government administration and take integrated steps to build a country, government, and society based on the rule of law. We will make all-around efforts to ensure sound legislation, strict law enforcement, impartial administration of justice, and society-wide observance of the law and see that all work of the state is carried out under the rule of law.\n\n1. Improving the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics with the Constitution at its core\n\nLaw-based governance and law-based exercise of state power begin with compliance with the Constitution. We must remain firmly committed to leadership of the Party, to the state system of people's democratic dictatorship, and to the political system of people's congresses, all of which are mandated by the Constitution. We will better implement the Constitution and conduct constitutional oversight, and we will improve the systems for ensuring full compliance with the Constitution, so as to give better play to the Constitution's important role in China's governance and uphold its authority.\n\nWe will step up legislation in key, emerging, and foreign-related fields and advance the rule of law in domestic and foreign-related affairs in a coordinated manner, so that good laws are made to promote development and ensure good governance. We will make further headway in making laws in a well-conceived and democratic way and in accordance with the law; we will take coordinated steps to enact, revise, abolish, interpret, and codify laws; and we will see that legislative work is more systematic, holistic, coordinated, and responsive. Improvements will be made to the record and review system for normative documents. We must ensure sound, democratic, and law-based decision-making and fully implement the procedural system for making major decisions.\n\n2. Steadily advancing law-based government administration\n\nBuilding a law-based government is a key task and major part of comprehensively advancing law-based governance. We will transform government functions, improve the government responsibility system and organizational structure, and establish legal footing for government institutions, functions, powers, procedures, and responsibilities, so as to enhance the efficiency and credibility of government administration. We will deepen reform of public institutions.\n\nWith regard to administrative law enforcement, we will advance structural reform to ensure that it is strict, procedure-based, impartial, and civil across the board, and we will intensify it in key areas involving the people's immediate interests. We will refine law enforcement procedures and the standards for administrative discretion, enhance oversight mechanisms and oversight capacity, and strictly implement responsibility and accountability systems. We will also improve the systems and mechanisms for coordinated law enforcement at the community level.\n\n3. Ensuring strict and impartial administration of justice\n\nAn impartial judiciary is the last line of defense for social fairness and justice. We will deepen comprehensive and integrated reform of the judicial system, fully and faithfully enforce judicial accountability, and accelerate the development of a fair, efficient, and authoritative socialist judicial system. We will see that the people feel justice has been served in each and every judicial case.\n\nWe will ensure the well-regulated exercise of judicial power and improve the systems and mechanisms that enable public security organs, procuratorates, courts, and administrative agencies for justice to perform their respective functions and to coordinate with and check one another. Checks and oversight on judicial activities will be enhanced to ensure judicial justice. Procuratorial organs will step up legal oversight, and the system of public-interest litigation will be improved.\n\n4. Stepping up efforts to establish the rule of law throughout society\n\nA society based on the rule of law is the foundation on which we can build a country under the rule of law. We will promote socialist rule of law and carry forward fine traditional Chinese legal culture, and we will encourage all our people to truly revere, readily observe, and firmly defend socialist rule of law. We will develop a modern public legal service system that covers both urban and rural populations and carry out intensive activities to raise public awareness of the rule of law. We will advance law-based governance at multiple levels and in multiple areas and enhance the rule of law in social governance. We will see that leading officials play an exemplary role and work hard to make respecting, learning about, observing, and applying the law common practice throughout society.\n\nVIII. Building Cultural Confidence and Strength and Securing New Successes in Developing Socialist Culture\n\nTo build a modern socialist country in all respects, we must develop a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics and be more confident in our culture. In our efforts to turn China into a country with a strong socialist culture, we will focus on upholding socialism with Chinese characteristics, rallying public support, fostering a new generation of young people, developing Chinese culture, and better presenting China to the world. We will develop a sound, people-oriented socialist culture for our nation that embraces modernization, the world, and the future. We will ignite the cultural creativity of the entire nation and build a powerful source of inspiration for realizing national rejuvenation.\n\nWe should uphold the foundational system for ensuring the guiding role of Marxism in the ideological domain. We will ensure that culture serves the people and serves socialism. We will follow the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and we will encourage creative transformation and innovative development of traditional Chinese culture. Guided by the core socialist values, we will develop advanced socialist culture, promote revolutionary culture, and carry forward fine traditional Chinese culture. In doing so, we will be well-placed to meet people's ever-growing intellectual and cultural needs, consolidate a common intellectual foundation for the whole Party and all Chinese people to strive in unity, and continuously grow China's cultural soft power and the appeal of Chinese culture.\n\n1. Developing a socialist ideology that has the power to unite and inspire the people\n\nIdeological work is about forging the character of a country and the soul of a nation. We must ensure that the Party firmly exercises leadership over this work and that the responsibility system for it is fully implemented. We will cement and expand the mainstream thoughts and ideas that inspire hard work in the new era.\n\nWe will refine the working systems for arming Party members, educating the people, and guiding our practice with the Party's new theories. We will make further progress in the project to study and develop Marxist theory. In philosophy and the social sciences, we will work faster to develop Chinese systems for fields of study, academia, and discourse, and we will cultivate a pool of talented philosophers and social scientists. We will improve the systems for communications across all forms of media and create a new environment of mainstream public opinion.\n\nWe will improve the system for conducting comprehensive cyberspace management and foster a healthy online environment.\n\n2. Extensively applying the core socialist values\n\nThe core socialist values have immense power to rally the people's support and pool their strength. We will carry forward the long line of inspiring principles for the Chinese Communists that originated with the great founding spirit of the Party; put resources related to the Party's heritage to great use; conduct extensive public awareness activities to promote the core socialist values; enhance commitment to patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; and foster a new generation of young people to shoulder the mission of realizing national rejuvenation.\n\nWe will develop and institutionalize regular activities to foster ideals and convictions, and we will carry out public awareness initiatives on the history of the Party, the People's Republic of China, reform and opening up, and the development of socialism, in order to foster love for the Party and the country. These efforts will help strengthen the people's commitment to our common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nWe will draw on the core socialist values to forge inner strength and inspire our people, improve the system of theoretical and political work, and integrate the political education curriculum across all levels, from elementary schools to universities.\n\nWe will uphold both the rule of law and the rule of virtue and see that the core socialist values are incorporated into efforts to advance the rule of law, into social development, and into the people's daily lives.\n\n3. Enhancing civility throughout society\n\nWe will continue the civic morality campaign, carry forward traditional Chinese virtues, foster stronger family ties, values, and traditions, and raise the intellectual and moral standards of minors. We will build public commitment to the greater good, public morality, and personal integrity. These efforts will help raise public moral standards and enhance public civility.\n\nTo promote cultural-ethical progress, we will take coordinated steps to raise awareness, apply principles, and develop initiatives and advance efforts in both urban and rural areas. We will foster an ethos of work, enterprise, dedication, creativity, and frugality throughout society and cultivate new trends and n",

                "cc_text": "When Donald Trump assumed office, there were concerns that he might reverse some of the existing sanctions. Congress, which at the time was controlled by the Republicans, premptively restrained Trump, passing legislation that imposed further sanctions on Iran, North Korea, and Russia, and blocked unilateral lifting of certain penalties. Inside the Treasury Department, career staff members were confused about Trumps intentions toward Russia. One former Administration official told me that Trump did not seem interested in sanctioning Russia: \"He was focussed on Ukraine and Hunter Biden. He was focussed on Iran. He was focussed on, could he make a deal with China.\"\n\nMost of the former Treasury officials I spoke to agreed that the sanctions levied in that era were insufficient. Vladimir Ashurkov, a director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which is connected with the imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, echoed that conclusion. He said, \"If the sanctions we have now had been gradually introduced over the eight years that passed since the first hostilities started in Ukraine, in 2014,\" the current tragedy might have been avoided. \"I think they sort of encouraged Putins assertiveness over this eight-year period. By February, 2022, I think he didnt expect much retaliation.\"\n\nThe sanctions rolled out in those years also provided Putin with an opportunity he could later turn to his advantage. He and his fellow-lites in Russia learned how to accommodate and compensate for the worst penalties of the Western sanctions regime. The government built an enormous cushion of foreign reserves that could be drawn upon to prop up the value of the ruble. It also established front companies across the world that could, if needed, help with the procurement of crucial technology and components. As a result, the work of Wally Adeyemo and his colleagues this year wasnt just informed by a long line of previous sanctions programs. It was complicated by them.\n\nStanding behind public-facing officials such as Adeyemo are career civil servants, many with deep expertise, who have chosen to forgo more lucrative jobs in the private sector. One of them is Elizabeth Rosenberg, the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes. Earlier in her career, having completed graduate work in Near Eastern studies, shed covered the energy sector, national security, and sanctions as a trade journalist. But eleven years ago she decided that it was worth taking a pay cut to help create the sanctions shed been writing about.\n\nIn the autumn of 2021, when intelligence reports about Russias activities on the Ukrainian border made it plain that Putin was preparing for a large-scale invasion, she and other officials began to model steps that they might want to take, such as restricting Russian oil and gas imports, and the possible impacts those moves might have on the global economy. \"Sanctions involve costs. Theres no way around it,\" Rosenberg said. \"We are cutting ourselves off from the Russian market. We have a responsibility to make sure we are not doing more than we have to.\"\n\nA crucial aspect of the bureaucrats work is sifting through intelligence data and predicting collateral damagenot just humanitarian costs but those detrimental to U.S. economic interests. Assessments of that damage had to be considered well before any decisions were finalized.\n\n\"Word around school is youve been attributing Shakespeares works to Edward de Vere.\" Cartoon by Lars Kenseth Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nRosenberg worked closely with Andrea Gacki, the director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, who earlier in her career was at the Justice Department defending sanctions against targets who had sued the government. Through the fall and winter, the two officials consulted with their foreign counterparts about some of the knottier aspects of what they hoped to do.\n\nRosenberg and her colleagues travelled repeatedly to the U.K. and Europe. Sometimes her delegation would arrive and learn that the Europeans had budgeted only an hour or two for the meeting. \"I would say, No, were going to need a lot of time, \" Rosenberg recalled. \" We need coffee, we need snacks, we need room availability. \" Other times, they would be met with surprise when they asked that representatives of a given countrys justice department and intelligence services attend the discussion, as national-security issues were bound to come up. Hours were spent reviewing whether a particular country had the legal authority to freeze Russian assets, and, if it didnt, what it needed to do to establish such authority. After most meetings ended, Rosenberg and her team would rush to the American Embassy to send the results of the sessions to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department is the only such institution in the world that has its own intelligence agency, situated in the departments headquarters, on Pennsylvania Avenue. On the night of February 23rd, Rosenberg went through heavy metal doors, placed her phone in a lockbox, and began work on a classified memo to Yellen about proposed sanctions. In an adjoining room, intelligence analysts who are on duty twenty-four hours a day stood behind banks of blinking monitors. Around 10 p.m., one of the analysts announced that Russia had launched missiles at Ukrainian targets. The war had begun. An official in the room that night recalled how the teams sense of purpose intensified: \"I will not forget how that felt.\" Sweeping sanctions against Russia went into effect within hours.\n\nYellen told me, \"Im involved in some discussions with people at the finance-minister level. But when I hang up the phone I say, My senior staff will be in touch with yours, and I cast all of this on Andrea and Wally and Liz, and they do the heavy lifting. If this all works out, its because of them.\"\n\nSome of the plans activated in February were less comprehensive than they first appeared. Dozens of Russian officials hadnt been touched, and the initial SWIFT ban applied to only seven banks. But the sanctions designers wanted to leave room to ramp up the pressure should Putin not respond as they hoped.\n\nAs Rosenberg explained to me, designing and implementing sanctions, which are largely about economic forecasts and banking relationships, often feels like mechanical work. Typical days involve composing and editing memos and passing them up the chain. Humanitarian concerns may feel very far away. \"And then you have Bucha\"the site of a massacre of civilians by Russian forces this spring\"and you think, Oh, my God, this is why were doing it.\"\n\nNot all of what unfolded shortly after the invasion was anticipated, including a mass private-sector exodus from Russia. Within days, the anger of the Western public had moved dozens of companiesamong them Apple, Netflix, ExxonMobil, and Shellto announce that they were withdrawing from the country. Before long roughly a thousand more businesses joined them and, in Yellens account, \"multiplied the impact\" of sanctions.\n\nSingh thought that the pullout would have a lasting effect. \"Once a McDonalds leaves, it doesnt come back, especially those that had physical infrastructure that they just abandoned in Russia,\" he said. \"That was big.\"\n\nFrom the Treasury officials perspective, more penalties are not always better; heedlessly adding names to sanctions lists may have destabilizing consequences. In 2018, for instance, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the aluminum magnate and oligarch Oleg Deripaska and his companies in response to Russias invasion of Crimea and other activities. The announcement jolted the global aluminum market, prompting a price spike.\n\nThe sanctions or seizures of foreign assetsfor instance, the impounding this March by European officials of gaudy yachts linked to Rosneft, the state-controlled oil conglomerate, and to Alexey Mordashov, reportedly the richest man in Russiaare preceded by careful study and legal review. Before an individual or a company appears on a sanctions list, a multidisciplinary team at OFAC, often working with other government agencies, analyzes the potential consequences and tries to minimize unintended results.\n\nPutin countered the sanctions with strategies to create demand for rubles and drive up their value. He required that most Russian oil and gas purchases be paid in rubles, and the Russian Central Bank restricted the ability of the countrys citizens to exchange their money for foreign notes. By the end of June, the price of the ruble had rebounded. A month later, the Russian military had made slow but solid gains. Among its achievements was bombing the strategically important port of Odesa, which disrupted plans to release grain stores there that were badly needed in other parts of the world.",

The 20th CPC National Congress opened on Sunday. [Photo/Xinhua]\n\nBEIJING - The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on Oct 22 approved the report presented by Xi Jinping on behalf of the 19th CPC Central Committee.\n\nHere is the full text of the report.\n\nHold High the Great Banner of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics and Strive in Unity to Build a Modern Socialist Country in All Respects\n\nComrades,\n\nOn behalf of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), I will now deliver a report to the 20th National Congress.\n\nThe 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China is a meeting of great importance. It takes place at a critical time as the entire Party and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups embark on a new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects and advance toward the Second Centenary Goal.\n\nThe theme of this Congress is holding high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, fully implementing the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, carrying forward the great founding spirit of the Party, staying confident and building strength, upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground, forging ahead with enterprise and fortitude, and striving in unity to build a modern socialist country in all respects and advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts.\n\nSince its founding a century ago, the Communist Party of China has taken a remarkable journey. Our Party has dedicated itself to achieving lasting greatness for the Chinese nation and committed itself to the noble cause of peace and development for humanity. Our responsibility is unmatched in importance, and our mission is glorious beyond compare. It is imperative that all of us in the Party never forget our original aspiration and founding mission, that we always stay modest, prudent, and hard-working, and that we have the courage and ability to carry on our fight. We must remain confident in our history, exhibit greater historical initiative, and write an even more magnificent chapter for socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.\n\nI. The Work of the Past Five Years and the Great Changes in the First Decade of the New Era\n\nThe five years since the 19th National Congress have been truly momentous and extraordinary. The Party Central Committee has pursued a strategy of national rejuvenation amid global changes of a magnitude not seen in a century. It has convened seven plenary sessions, at which it adopted decisions and resolutions on major issues such as revising China's Constitution, deepening reform of Party and state institutions, upholding and improving the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernizing China's system and capacity for governance, formulating the 14th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives through the Year 2035, and conducting a thorough review of the Party's major achievements and historical experience over the past century. At these sessions, major strategic plans were also made for advancing the cause of the Party and the country. The Central Committee has brought together the entire Party, the military, and the Chinese people and led them in effectively responding to grave, intricate international developments and a series of immense risks and challenges. With great effort and determination, we have steadily advanced socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.\n\nOver the past five years, we have continued to strengthen the overall leadership of the Party and the centralized, unified leadership of the Central Committee. We have devoted great energy to finishing building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. We have fully and faithfully applied the new development philosophy on all fronts, focused on promoting high-quality development, and worked to create a new pattern of development. We have pursued reform at a swift and steady pace, made solid progress in developing whole-process people's democracy, and advanced law-based governance across all fields of endeavor. We have actively developed advanced socialist culture. We have ensured and improved public wellbeing as a matter of priority and pooled resources to wage a critical battle against poverty. We have made a big push to enhance ecological conservation. We have worked with firm resolve to safeguard national security, fended off and defused major risks, and ensured social stability. We have devoted great energy to modernizing our national defense and the armed forces. We have conducted major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics on all fronts. And we have made sweeping efforts to advance the great new project of Party building.\n\nWe celebrated the centenary of the Communist Party of China and the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We adopted the third resolution concerning the Party's history, organized Party-wide activities to study Party history, and inaugurated the Museum of the Communist Party of China. We called upon all Party members to study and apply the great founding spirit of the Party, and we encouraged them to create a brighter future by staying true to the Party's founding mission with greater resolve and purpose on the new journey ahead.\n\nIn responding to the sudden outbreak of Covid-19, we put the people and their lives above all else, worked to prevent both imported cases and domestic resurgences, and tenaciously pursued a dynamic zero-Covid policy. In launching an all-out people's war to stop the spread of the virus, we have protected the people's health and safety to the greatest extent possible and made tremendously encouraging achievements in both epidemic response and economic and social development.\n\nIn the face of turbulent developments in Hong Kong, the central government exercised its overall jurisdiction over the special administrative region as prescribed by China's Constitution and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was formulated and put into effect, ensuring that Hong Kong is administered by patriots. Thanks to these moves, order has been restored in Hong Kong, marking a major turn for the better in the region. Further headway has been made in developing the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and supporting Hong Kong and Macao in growing their economies, improving living standards, and maintaining stability.\n\nIn response to separatist activities aimed at \"Taiwan independence\" and gross provocations of external interference in Taiwan affairs, we have resolutely fought against separatism and countered interference, demonstrating our resolve and ability to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to oppose \"Taiwan independence.\" We have strengthened our strategic initiative for China's complete reunification and consolidated commitment to the one-China principle within the international community.\n\nConfronted with drastic changes in the international landscape, especially external attempts to blackmail, contain, blockade, and exert maximum pressure on China, we have put our national interests first, focused on internal political concerns, and maintained firm strategic resolve. We have shown a fighting spirit and a firm determination to never yield to coercive power. Throughout these endeavors, we have safeguarded China's dignity and core interests and kept ourselves well-positioned for pursuing development and ensuring security.\n\nOver the past five years, our Party has rallied the people and led them in solving a great number of problems that had long gone unsolved, securing many accomplishments that hold major future significance, and achieving impressive advances in the cause of the Party and the country.\n\nComrades,\n\nTen years have passed since the Party's 18th National Congress. The past decade marked three major events of great immediate importance and profound historical significance for the cause of the Party and the people: We embraced the centenary of the Communist Party of China; we ushered in a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics; and we eradicated absolute poverty and finished building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, thus completing the First Centenary Goal. These were historic featsfeats accomplished by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people striving in unity, feats that will be forever recorded in the Chinese nation's history, and feats that will profoundly influence the world.\n\nA decade ago this was the situation we faced:\n\nGreat achievements had been secured in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, and notable advances had been made in the great new project of Party building. All this had created solid foundations, favorable conditions, and key underpinnings for our continued progress.\n\nAt the same time, however, a number of prominent issues and problemssome of which had been building for years and others which were just emergingdemanded urgent action.\n\nInside the Party, there were many issues with respect to upholding the Party's leadership, including a lack of clear understanding and effective action as well as a slide toward weak, hollow, and watered-down Party leadership in practice. Some Party members and officials were wavering in their political conviction. Despite repeated warnings, pointless formalities, bureaucratism, hedonism, and extravagance persisted in some localities and departments. Privilege-seeking mindsets and practices posed a serious problem, and some deeply shocking cases of corruption had been uncovered.\n\nChina's economy was beset by acute structural and institutional problems. Development was imbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable, and the traditional development model could no longer keep us moving forward. Some deep-seated problems in institutions and barriers built by vested interests were becoming more and more apparent.\n\nSome people lacked confidence in the socialist political system with Chinese characteristics, and, all too often, we saw laws being ignored or not being strictly enforced.\n\nMisguided patterns of thinking such as money worship, hedonism, egocentricity, and historical nihilism were common, and online discourse was rife with disorder. All this had a grave impact on people's thinking and the public opinion environment.\n\nOur work to ensure the people's wellbeing was fraught with weak links. Tightening resource and environmental constraints and environmental pollution were pronounced.\n\nThe systems for safeguarding national security were inadequate, and our capacity for responding to various major risks was insufficient. Many shortcomings were affecting the modernization of national defense and the military.\n\nThe institutions and mechanisms for implementing the policy of One Country, Two Systems in Hong Kong and Macao were not well-developed, and China faced grave challenges to its national security.\n\nThese were just some of the problems we faced. Back then, many people, both in and outside of our Party, were worried about the future of the Party and the country.\n\nIn the face of these acute problems and challenges, which undermined the Party's long-term governance, the security and stability of the country, and the wellbeing of the people, the Party Central Committee fully assessed the situation, made resolute decisions, and took firm steps. Under its leadership, the entire Party, the military, and the Chinese people were brought together. We rolled up our sleeves and got down to work, forging ahead with resolve to carry out a great struggle with many new features of our times.\n\nOver the past decade, we have stayed committed to Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, and we have fully implemented the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as well as the Party's basic line and basic policy. We have adopted a number of strategic measures, developed a range of transformative practices, and made a series of breakthroughs and landmark advances. We have withstood risks, challenges, and trials in the political, economic, ideological, and natural domains, secured historic achievements and seen historic changes in the cause of the Party and the country, and taken China on a new journey toward building a modern socialist country in all respects.\n\nWe have established the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. In doing so, we have laid out the basic policy for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, put forward a series of new ideas, new thinking, and new strategies on national governance, and achieved a new breakthrough in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of our times. We have endeavored to use this new theory to arm ourselves intellectually, guide our practice, and advance our work. This theory provides us with fundamental guidance for advancing the cause of our Party and our country in the new era.\n\nWe have strengthened Party leadership in all respects. We have made clear that the leadership of the Communist Party of China is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the greatest strength of the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, that the Party is the highest force of political leadership, and that upholding the centralized, unified leadership of the Party Central Committee is the highest political principle. We have made systematic improvements to the Party's leadership systems. All Party members have become more conscious of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment with the central Party leadership. They have become more purposeful in closely following the Party Central Committee in thinking, political stance, and action, and they have continued to improve their capacity for political judgment, thinking, and implementation. All this has ensured the Party Central Committee's authority and its centralized, unified leadership and guaranteed that the Party fulfills its core role of exercising overall leadership and coordinating the efforts of all sides. Now, our Marxist party of over 96 million members enjoys greater unity and solidarity than ever.\n\nWe have developed well-conceived and complete strategic plans for advancing the cause of the Party and the country in the new era. We have put forward the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and proposed promoting national rejuvenation through a Chinese path to modernization. We have made well-coordinated efforts to advance our great struggle, our great project, our great cause, and our great dream. We have adopted the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy[ The Five-Sphere Integrated Plan is to promote coordinated economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological advancement. The Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy is to make comprehensive moves to build a modern socialist country, deepen reform, advance law-based governance, and strengthen Party self-governance.] as well as the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, and we have worked to both pursue development and safeguard security. We have identified the principal contradiction facing Chinese society as that between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's ever-growing needs for a better life, and we have made it clear that closing this gap should be the focus of all our initiatives. With these efforts, we have made constant progress in enriching and developing a new form of human advancement.\n\nWe have achieved moderate prosperity, the millennia-old dream of the Chinese nation, through persistent hard work. With this, we have elevated China to a higher historical starting point in development. By galvanizing the entire nation to carry out targeted poverty alleviation, we have won the largest battle against poverty in human history. A total of 832 impoverished counties and close to 100 million poor rural residents have been lifted out of poverty, and, among them, more than 9.6 million poverty-stricken people have been relocated from inhospitable areas. We have, once and for all, resolved the problem of absolute poverty in China, making significant contributions to the cause of global poverty reduction.\n\nWe have put forward and applied a new development philosophy, worked hard to promote high-quality development, and pushed to foster a new pattern of development. We have carried out supply-side structural reform, formulated a series of major regional strategies important to China's overall development, and brought about a historic rise in China's economic strength.\n\nIn the past decade, China's GDP has grown from 54 trillion yuan to 114 trillion yuan to account for 18.5 percent of the world economy, up 7.2 percentage points. China has remained the world's second largest economy, and its per capita GDP has risen from 39,800 yuan to 81,000 yuan. It ranks first in the world in terms of grain output, and it has ensured food and energy security for its more than 1.4 billion people. The number of permanent urban residents has grown by 11.6 percentage points to account for 64.7 percent of the population. China's manufacturing sector is the largest in the world, as are its foreign exchange reserves. China has built the world's largest networks of high-speed railways and expressways and made major achievements in building airports, ports, and water conservancy, energy, information, and other infrastructure.\n\nWe have accelerated efforts to build our self-reliance and strength in science and technology, with nationwide R&D spending rising from 1 trillion yuan to 2.8 trillion yuan, the second highest in the world. Our country is now home to the largest cohort of R&D personnel in the world.\n\nWe have grown stronger in basic research and original innovation, made breakthroughs in some core technologies in key fields, and boosted emerging strategic industries. We have witnessed major successes on multiple fronts, including manned spaceflight, lunar and Martian exploration, deep sea and deep earth probes, supercomputers, satellite navigation, quantum information, nuclear power technology, new energy technology, airliner manufacturing, and biomedicine. China has joined the ranks of the world's innovators.\n\nWe have comprehensively deepened reform with tremendous political courage. We have carried out critical tasks and enhanced top-level design for reform. We have dared to brave uncharted waters, take on tough problems, navigate potential dangers, and face new issues and challenges. We have broken the shackles of stale thinking, torn down barriers erected by vested interests, and removed institutional obstacles in all areas. This has enabled us to put in place foundational institutional frameworks in all sectors, to achieve historic, systemic, and holistic transformations in many fields, and to complete a new round of reform in Party and state institutions. The system of socialism with Chinese characteristics has become more mature and well-defined, and China's system and capacity for governance have been further modernized.\n\nWe have pursued a more proactive strategy of opening up. We have worked to build a globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas and accelerated the development of pilot free trade zones and the Hainan Free Trade Port. As a collaborative endeavor, the Belt and Road Initiative has been welcomed by the international community both as a public good and a cooperation platform. China has become a major trading partner for more than 140 countries and regions, it leads the world in total volume of trade in goods, and it is a major destination for global investment and a leading country in outbound investment. Through these efforts, we have advanced a broader agenda of opening up across more areas and in greater depth.\n\nWe have kept to the path of socialist political advancement with Chinese characteristics. We have comprehensively developed whole-process people's democracy, made all-around progress in improving the institutions, standards, and procedures of our socialist democracy, and advanced socialist consultative democracy by way of extensive participation. We have reinforced the foundations that undergird the people's running of the country, injected fresh vitality into democracy at the community level, and consolidated and expanded the patriotic united front. We have made new accomplishments in promoting ethnic unity and progress, fully implemented the Party's basic policy on religious affairs, and provided better protections for human rights. We have intensified efforts to advance socialist rule of law in our country, and a comprehensive framework for law-based governance has taken shape. We have sped up work on developing the system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics. We have made major progress in reforming the judicial system, thus providing more effective protection for social fairness and justice. These efforts have opened new ground for advancing the rule of law in China.\n\nWe have established and upheld a foundational system for ensuring the guiding role of Marxism in the ideological domain. The Party's new theory for the new era has been embraced by the people, the core socialist values are resonating with the public, fine traditional Chinese culture is undergoing creative transformation and development, cultural programs are flourishing, and the online environment has seen continuous improvement. All this has brought overarching and fundamental changes in China's ideological landscape.\n\nWe celebrated the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the 40th anniversary of the launch of reform and opening up, the 70th anniversary of victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the global war against fascism, and the 70th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure for Korea to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics were a great success. Our young people are filled with greater optimism and enterprise, and there is a notably stronger sense of cultural confidence and a higher level of morale throughout the Party and the nation.\n\nWe have implemented a people-centered philosophy of development. We have worked continuously to ensure people's access to childcare, education, employment, medical services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, thus bringing about an all-around improvement in people's lives. China's life expectancy has reached 78.2 years, its per capita disposable annual income has risen from 16,500 yuan to 35,100 yuan, and more than 13 million urban jobs have been created each year on average over the past 10 years. We have built the largest education, social security, and healthcare systems in the world. These achievements have allowed us to make historic strides in making education universally available, bring 1.04 billion people under the coverage of basic old-age insurance, and ensure basic medical insurance for 95 percent of the population. Timely adjustments have been made to the childbirth policy. More than 42 million housing units in run-down urban areas and more than 24 million dilapidated rural houses have been rebuilt, marking a significant improvement in housing conditions in both urban and rural areas. The number of internet users has reached 1.03 billion. We have ensured a more complete and lasting sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security for our people, and we have made further progress in achieving common prosperity for all.\n\nWe have acted on the idea that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets. We have persisted with a holistic and systematic approach to conserving and improving mountain, water, forest, farmland, grassland, and desert ecosystems, and we have ensured stronger ecological conservation and environmental protection across the board, in all regions, and at all times. China's ecological conservation systems have been improved, the critical battle against pollution has been advanced, and solid progress has been made in promoting green, circular, and low-carbon development. This has led to historic, transformative, and comprehensive changes in ecological and environmental protection and has brought us bluer skies, greener mountains, and cleaner waters.\n\nWe have applied a holistic approach to national security. We have steadily improved the leadership, legal, strategy, and policy systems for national security. We have not yielded any ground on matters of principle, and we have resolutely safeguarded China's sovereignty, security, and development interests. National security has thus been strengthened on all fronts. We have further improved the social governance system based on collaboration, participation, and shared benefits. We have effectively contained ethnic separatists, religious extremists, and violent terrorists and secured important progress in the campaigns to combat and root out organized crime. We have responded effectively to major natural disasters. The Peaceful China Initiative has entered a new stage.\n\nWe have set the Party's goal of building a strong military in the new era. We have implemented the Party's thinking on strengthening the military for the new era, followed the military strategy for the new era, and upheld absolute Party leadership over the people's armed forces. We held a meeting on military political work in Gutian in 2014 and improved political conduct through rectification initiatives. Having established combat effectiveness as the sole criterion, we have acted with resolve to focus the entire military's attention on combat readiness. We have coordinated efforts to strengthen military work in all directions and domains and devoted great energy to training under combat conditions. We have carried out bold reforms of national defense and the armed forces, restructuring the military leadership and command systems, the modern armed forces system, and the military policy system. We have moved faster to modernize our national defense and the armed forces and reduced the number of active service personnel by 300,000. With new systems, a new structure, a new configuration, and a new look, the people's armed forces have become a much more modern and capable fighting force, and the Chinese path to building a strong military is growing ever broader.\n\nWe have fully and faithfully implemented the policy of One Country, Two Systems. We have upheld the policy of One Country, Two Systems, under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong and the people of Macao administer Macao, both with a high degree of autonomy. We have helped Hong Kong enter a new stage in which it has restored order and is set to thrive, and we have seen both Hong Kong and Macao maintain good momentum for long-term stability and development. We have put forward an overall policy framework for resolving the Taiwan question in the new era and facilitated cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation. We have resolutely opposed separatist activities aimed at \"Taiwan independence\" and foreign interference. We have thus maintained the initiative and the ability to steer in cross-Strait relations.\n\nWe have pursued major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics on all fronts. We have promoted the development of a human community with a shared future and stood firm in protecting international fairness and justice. We have advocated and practiced true multilateralism. We have taken a clear-cut stance against hegemonism and power politics in all their forms, and we have never wavered in our opposition to unilateralism, protectionism, and bullying of any kind. We have improved China's overall diplomatic agenda and worked actively to build a global network of partnerships and foster a new type of international relations. We have demonstrated China's sense of duty as a responsible major country, actively participating in the reform and development of the global governance system and engaging in all-around international cooperation in the fight against Covid-19. All this has seen us win widespread international recognition. China's international influence, appeal, and power to shape have risen markedly.\n\nWe have made significant advances in exercising full and rigorous Party self-governance. Guided by the belief that it takes a good blacksmith to forge good steel, we kicked off our efforts by formulating and implementing the central Party leadership's eight-point decision on improving conduct. We have put forward and implemented the general requirements for strengthening the Party in the new era. We have set strengthening ourselves politically as the overarching guide for all other initiatives of Party building, and we have made sure that our ideological work is aligned with our institution building efforts. Intraparty political activities have been conducted in earnest, and we have continued to carry out intensive education initiatives. We have formulated and implemented the Party's organizational line for the new era and placed an emphasis on political commitment in selecting and appointing officials. Political inspections have been strengthened, and a sound system of Party regulations has taken shape. These moves have enabled the entire Party to maintain firm ideals and convictions and have strengthened the Party's organizational system and tightened discipline and rules.\n\nWe have worked ceaselessly to improve Party conduct and enforce Party discipline. We have hammered away at the task of rectifying pointless formalities, bureaucratism, hedonism, and extravagance; opposed privilege-seeking mindsets and practices; and taken strong action to address misconduct and corruption that occur at people's doorsteps. Thanks to these efforts, unhealthy tendencies that had long gone unchecked have been reversed, and deep-seated problems that had plagued us for years have been remedied.\n\nWe have waged a battle against corruption on a scale unprecedented in our history. Driven by a strong sense of mission, we have resolved to \"offend a few thousand rather than fail 1.4 billion\" and to clear our Party of all its ills. We have taken coordinated steps to see that officials do not have the audacity, opportunity, or desire to be corrupt, and we have used a combination of measures to \"take out tigers,\" \"swat flies,\" and \"hunt down foxes,\" punishing corrupt officials of all types. We have achieved an overwhelming victory and fully consolidated the gains in our fight against corruption. All this has helped remove serious hidden dangers in the Party, the country, and the military and ensured that the power granted to us by the Party and the people is always exercised in the interests of the people.\n\nThrough painstaking efforts, the Party has found a second answer to the question of how to escape the historical cycle of rise and fall. The answer is self-reform. We have significantly boosted the Party's ability to purify, improve, renew, and excel itself, addressed the problem of lax and weak self-governance in Party organizations at the root, and steadily fostered and developed a political atmosphere of integrity within the Party. By doing so, we have ensured that the Party will never change its nature, its conviction, or its character.\n\nAs we fully affirm the remarkable achievements we have made in the cause of the Party and the country, we must not lose sight of the shortcomings in our work and the many difficulties and problems confronting us. They are mainly as follows:\n\nImbalances and inadequacies in development remain a prominent problem. There are many bottlenecks hindering high-quality development, and China's capacity for scientific and technological innovation is not yet strong enough. Many major issues need to be resolved in order to guard against financial risks and ensure that food, energy, and industrial and supply chains are secure and reliable.\n\nThere are still many tough issues to be addressed in the reform of key areas. Quite a few challenges exist in the ideological domain. There are still wide gaps in development and income distribution between urban and rural areas and between regions. Our people face many difficulties in areas such as employment, education, medical services, childcare, elderly care, and housing. Ecological conservation and environmental protection remain a formidable task.\n\nSome Party members and officials lack a strong sense of responsibility, the capacity to grapple with tough challenges, and the readiness to get down to work. Pointless formalities and bureaucratism remain rather pronounced. Eradicating breeding grounds for corruption is still an arduous task.\n\nWe have already put in place a series of measures to deal with these problems, and we must redouble our efforts to see them fully resolved.\n\nComrades,\n\nThe great achievements of the new era have come from the collective dedication and hard work of our Party and our people. Here, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I express our heartfelt gratitude to all of our Party members, to the people of all ethnic groups, to all other political parties, people's organizations, and patriotic figures from all sectors of society, to our fellow compatriots in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, in Taiwan, and overseas, and to all our friends around the world who have shown understanding and support for China's modernization drive.\n\nThe great transformation over the past 10 years of the new era marks a milestone in the history of the Party, of the People's Republic of China, of reform and opening up, of the development of socialism, and of the development of the Chinese nation. Over the course of a century of endeavor, the Communist Party of China has tempered itself through revolution and grown stronger. It has grown better at providing political leadership, giving theoretical guidance, organizing the people, and inspiring society, all while maintaining a close bond with the people. Throughout the Party's history, as the world has undergone profound changes, it has always remained at the forefront of the times. As we have responded to risks and tests at home and abroad, the Party has always remained the backbone of the nation. And as we have upheld and developed socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Party has always remained a strong leadership core.\n\nThe Chinese people are more inspired than ever to forge ahead, more resolved than ever to work hard, and more confident than ever of securing success. They are filled with a stronger sense of history and initiative. With full confidence, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are driving the great transformation of the Chinese nation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong. We have advanced reform, opening up, and socialist modernization and have written a new chapter on the miracles of fast economic growth and long-term social stability. China now has more solid material foundations and stronger institutional underpinnings for pursuing development. The rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is now on an irreversible historical course.\n\nScientific socialism is brimming with renewed vitality in 21st-century China. Chinese modernization offers humanity a new choice for achieving modernization. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have provided humanity with more Chinese insight, better Chinese input, and greater Chinese strength to help solve its common challenges and have made new and greater contributions to the noble cause of human peace and development.\n\nII. A New Frontier in Adapting Marxism to the Chinese Context and the Needs of the Times\n\nMarxism is the fundamental guiding ideology upon which our Party and our country are founded and thrive. Our experience has taught us that, at the fundamental level, we owe the success of our Party and socialism with Chinese characteristics to the fact that Marxism works, particularly when it is adapted to the Chinese context and the needs of our times. The sound theoretical guidance of Marxism is the source from which our Party draws its firm belief and conviction and which enables our Party to seize the historical initiative.\n\nAdapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of the times is a process of seeking, revealing, and applying truth. With new changes and practical demands emerging both in and outside of China since the 18th National Congress, there was an urgent need for us to provide in-depth theoretical and practical answers to a series of epochal questions on the cause of the Party and the country as well as the Party's governance of China.\n\nWith the courage to make theoretical explorations and innovations, our Party has, from an entirely new perspective, deepened its understanding of the laws that underlie governance by a communist party, the development of socialism, and the evolution of human society. It has achieved major theoretical innovations, which are encapsulated in the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The main elements of this theory are summarized in the 10 affirmations, the 14 commitments, and the 13 areas of achievement that were articulated at the 19th National Congress and the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Party Central Committee, all of which we must adhere to over the long term and continue to enrich and develop.\n\nChinese Communists are keenly aware that only by integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China's specific realities and fine traditional culture and only by applying dialectical and historical materialism can we provide correct answers to the major questions presented by the times and discovered through practice and can we ensure that Marxism always retains its vigor and vitality.\n\nTo uphold and develop Marxism, we must integrate it with China's specific realities. Taking Marxism as our guide means applying its worldview and methodology to solving problems in China; it does not mean memorizing and reciting its specific conclusions and lines, and still less does it mean treating it as a rigid dogma. We must continue to free our minds, seek truth from facts, move with the times, and take a realistic and pragmatic approach. We must base everything we do on actual conditions and focus on solving real problems arising in our reform, opening up, and socialist modernization endeavors in the new era. We must keep responding to the questions posed by China, by the world, by the people, and by the times; in doing so, we should find the right answers suited to the realities of China and the needs of our day, reach conclusions that are compatible with objective laws, and develop new theories that are in step with the times, so as to provide better guidance for China's practice.\n\nTo uphold and develop Marxism, we must integrate it with China's fine traditional culture. Only by taking root in the rich historical and cultural soil of the country and the nation can the truth of Marxism flourish here. With a history stretching back to antiquity, China's fine traditional culture is extensive and profound; it is the crystallization of the wisdom of Chinese civilization. Our traditional culture espouses many important principles and concepts, including pursuing common good for all; regarding the people as the foundation of the state; governing by virtue; discarding the outdated in favor of the new; selecting officials on the basis of merit; promoting harmony between humanity and nature; ceaselessly pursuing self-improvement; embracing the world with virtue; acting in good faith and being friendly to others; and fostering neighborliness. These maxims, which have taken shape over centuries of work and life, reflect the Chinese people's way of viewing the universe, the world, society, and morality and are highly consistent with the values and propositions of scientific socialism.\n\nWe must stay confident in our history and culture, make the past serve the present, and develop the new from the old. We must integrate the essence of Marxism with the best of fine traditional Chinese culture and with the common values that our people intuitively apply in their everyday lives. We should keep endowing Marxist theory with distinctive Chinese features and consolidating the historical basis and public support for adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of our times. With this, we will ensure that Marxism puts down deep roots in China.\n\nJust as there are no bounds to practice, there is no end to theoretical innovation. It is the solemn historical responsibility of today's Chinese Communists to continue opening new chapters in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of the times. To keep advancing theoretical innovation on the basis of practical experience, we must, first of all, gain a good command of the worldview and methodology of the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and adhere to and make good use of its stances, viewpoints, and methods.\n\nWe must put the people first. People-centeredness is an essential attribute of Marxism. Our Party's theories are from the people, for the people, and beneficial to the people. The people's creative practices are the inexhaustible source of our theoretical innovations. Theories that are detached from the people will be feeble and ineffective, and theories that cannot deliver for the people will be stale and lifeless. We must stand firmly with the people, respond to their wishes, respect their creativity, and pool their wisdom to develop theories that they like, accept, and adopt and that become powerful tools guiding them in understanding and changing the world.\n\nWe must maintain self-confidence and stand on our own feet. There has never been an instruction manual or ready-made solution for the Chinese people and the Chinese nation to turn to as they fought to end the great sufferings endured since the advent of modern times and have moved on toward the bright future of rejuvenation. The Party has led the people in independently blazing the path to success over the past century, and the success of Marxism in China has been realized by Chinese Communists through our own endeavors. One point underpinning these successes is that China's issues must be dealt with by Chinese people in light of the Chinese context. We must remain firm in our conviction in Marxism and socialism with Chinese characteristics and strengthen our confidence in the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics. With a stronger sense of historical responsibility and creativity, we should make greater contributions to the development of Marxism. We should never act blindly without assessing how conditions have evolved or allow ourselves to become ossified or closed off, nor should we mechanically imitate others or indiscriminately absorb foreign ideas.\n\nWe must uphold fundamental principles and break new ground. We are advancing a great cause that none have attempted before. Only by upholding fundamental principles can we avoid losing our bearings or making catastrophic mistakes. Only by breaking new ground can we meet the call of the day and shape the trends of our times. We should approach Marxism with a respect for science and in the spirit of seeking truth. We must never waver in upholding the basic tenets of Marxism, the overall leadership of the Party, and socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should keep pace with the times and adapt to the evolution of practice. We should approach each and every new thing with great enthusiasm and never stop broadening and deepening our understanding of the world. We must dare to say what has never been said and do what has never been done, and we must use new theory to guide new practice.\n\nWe must adopt a problem-oriented approach. Problems represent the voice of the times. The fundamental task of theory is to respond to problems and provide guidelines for finding solutions. The problems we face today are considerably more complex, and resolving them has become much more difficult. This presents a completely new challenge for theoretical innovation. We must be more conscious of problems, especially new problems that are discovered through practice, deep-seated problems affecting reform, development, and stability, pressing concerns of the people, major issues in the evolving global landscape, and prominent issues we face in Party building. We should keep developing new thinking, new approaches, and new ways to effectively resolve problems.\n\nWe must apply systems thinking. All things are interconnected and interdependent. We must view them with the understanding that they are universally connected, part of a complete system, and constantly evolving if we are to grasp the laws governing their development.\n\nAs a major developing country, China is still in the primary stage of socialism and is going through an extensive and profound social transformation. A small move made to advance reform and development or to adjust interests may affect the bigger picture. We should be able to see the present from a historical perspective, look beyond the surface to get to the crux of issues, and properly manage the relationships between overall and local interests, between the present and the future, between macro and micro concerns, between primary and secondary issues, and between the special and the ordinary. We should improve our ability to adopt a strategic perspective and apply a historical, dialectical, and systematic approach to thinking; we should get better at thinking creatively, thinking in terms of the rule of law, and considering worst-case scenarios. By doing so, we can develop a well-conceived approach to planning and advancing the endeavors of the Party and the country on all fronts in a forward-looking and holistic manner.\n\nWe must maintain a global vision. The Communist Party of China is dedicated to pursuing happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. It is also dedicated to human progress and world harmony. We should expand our global vision and develop keen insight into the trends of human development and progress, respond to the general concerns of people of all countries, and play our part in resolving the common issues facing humankind. With an open mind, we should draw inspiration from all of human civilization's outstanding achievements and work to build an even better world.\n\nIII. The New Journey of the New Era: Missions and Tasks of the Communist Party of China\n\nFrom this day forward, the central task of the Communist Party of China will be to lead the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in a concerted effort to realize the Second Centenary Goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization.\n\nBased on our decades of exploration and practice since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, especially since the launch of reform and opening up in 1978, as well as the new breakthroughs made in theory and practice since the 18th National Congress, we have succeeded in advancing and expanding Chinese modernization.\n\nChinese modernization is socialist modernization pursued under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. It contains elements that are common to the modernization processes of all countries, but it is more characterized by features that are unique to the Chinese context.\n\nIt is the modernization of a huge population. China is working to achieve modernization for more than 1.4 billion people, a number larger than the combined population of all developed countries in the world today. This is a task of unparalleled difficulty and complexity; it inevitably means that our pathways of development and methods of advancement will be unique. We will, as always, bear China's realities in mind as we address issues, make decisions, and take action. We will neither pursue grandiose goals nor go by the rulebook. We will stay patient in advancing the course of history and take steady and incremental steps to sustain progress.\n\nIt is the modernization of common prosperity for all. Achieving common prosperity is a defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and involves a long historical process. The immutable goal of our modernization drive is to meet the people's aspirations for a better life. We will endeavor to maintain and promote social fairness and justice, bring prosperity to all, and prevent polarization.\n\nIt is the modernization of material and cultural-ethical advancement. Material abundance and cultural-ethical enrichment are fundamental goals of socialist modernization. Material want is not socialism, nor is cultural impoverishment. While continuing to consolidate the material foundation for modernization and improve the material conditions for people's wellbeing, we will strive to develop advanced socialist culture, foster strong ideals and convictions, and carry forward China's cultural heritage. We will thus promote all-around material abundance as well as people's well-rounded development.\n\nIt is the modernization of harmony between humanity and nature. Humanity and nature make up a community of life. If we extract from nature without limit or inflict damage on it, we are bound to face its retaliation. China is committed to sustainable development and to the principles of prioritizing resource conservation and environmental protection and letting nature restore itself. We will protect nature and the environment as we do our own lives. We will continue to pursue a model of sound development featuring improved production, higher living standards, and healthy ecosystems to ensure the sustainable development of the Chinese nation.\n\nIt is the modernization of peaceful development. In pursuing modernization, China will not tread the old path of war, colonization, and plunder taken by some countries. That brutal and blood-stained path of enrichment at the expense of others caused great suffering for the people of developing countries. We will stand firmly on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. Dedicated to peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit, we will strive to safeguard world peace and development as we pursue our own development, and we will make greater contributions to world peace and development through our own development.\n\nThe essential requirements of Chinese modernization are as follows: upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China and socialism with Chinese characteristics, pursuing high-quality development, developing whole-process people's democracy, enriching the people's cultural lives, achieving common prosperity for all, promoting harmony between humanity and nature, building a human community with a shared future, and creating a new form of human advancement.\n\nTo build China into a great modern socialist country in all respects, we have adopted a two-step strategic plan:\n\nBasically realize socialist modernization from 2020 through 2035\n\nBuild China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful from 2035 through the middle of this century\n\nChina's overall development objectives for the year 2035 are as follows:\n\nSignificantly increase economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, and composite national strength; substantially grow the per capita GDP to be on par with that of a mid-level developed country\n\nJoin the ranks of the world's most innovative countries, with great self-reliance and strength in science and technology\n\nBuild a modernized economy; form a new pattern of development; basically achieve new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization\n\nBasically modernize the system and capacity for governance; improve the system for whole-process people's democracy; build a law-based country, government, and society\n\nBecome a leading country in education, science and technology, talent, culture, sports, and health; significantly enhance national soft power\n\nEnsure that the people are leading better and happier lives; bring per capita disposable income to new heights; substantially grow the middle-income group as a share of the total population; guarantee equitable access to basic public services; ensure modern standards of living in rural areas; achieve long-term social stability; make more notable and substantive progress in promoting the people's well-rounded development and prosperity for all\n\nBroadly establish eco-friendly ways of work and life; steadily lower carbon emissions after reaching a peak; fundamentally improve the environment; largely accomplish the goal of building a Beautiful China\n\nComprehensively strengthen the national security system and national security capabilities; achieve basic modernization of national defense and the armed forces\n\nAfter basically realizing modernization, we will continue to work hard and build China into a great modern socialist country that leads the world in terms of composite national strength and international influence by the middle of the century.\n\nThe next five years will be crucial for getting our efforts to build a modern socialist country in all respects off to a good start. Our main objectives and tasks for this period are as follows:\n\nMake breakthroughs in promoting high-quality economic development; achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology; make major progress in creating a new pattern of development and building a modernized economy\n\nMake new strides in reform and opening up; make further progress in modernizing China's system and capacity for governance; further improve the socialist market economy; put in place new systems for a higher-standard open economy\n\nFurther enhance the institutions, standards, and procedures of whole-process people's democracy; improve the system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics\n\nEnrich the intellectual and cultural lives of our people; enhance the cohesion of the Chinese nation and the appeal of Chinese culture\n\nEnsure personal income grows basically in step with economic growth and pay rises in tandem with increases in productivity; ensure much more equitable access to basic public services; develop a better multi-tiered social security system\n\nSubstantially improve urban and rural living environments; make notable progress in building a Beautiful China\n\nFurther consolidate national security; fulfill the goals for the centenary of the People's Liberation Army in 2027; make solid progress in building a Peaceful China\n\nFurther increase China's international standing and influence; enable China to play a greater role in global governance\n\nBuilding a modern socialist country in all respects is a great and arduous endeavor. Our future is bright, but we still have a long way to go. At present, momentous changes of a like not seen in a century are accelerating across the world. A new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation is well under way, and a significant shift is taking place in the international balance of power, presenting China with new strategic opportunities in pursuing development. At the same time, however, the once-in-a-century pandemic has had far-reaching effects; a backlash against globalization is rising; and unilateralism and protectionism are mounting. The global economic recovery is sluggish, regional conflicts and disturbances are frequent, and global issues are becoming more acute. The world has entered a new period of turbulence and change.\n\nAt home, we face many deep-seated problems regarding reform, development, and stability that cannot be avoided or bypassed. In our efforts to strengthen the Party, and especially to improve conduct, build integrity, and combat corruption, we are confronted with many stubborn and recurrent problems. External attempts to suppress and contain China may escalate at any time.\n\nOur country has entered a period of development in which strategic opportunities, risks, and challenges are concurrent and uncertainties and unforeseen factors are rising. Various \"black swan\" and \"gray rhino\" events may occur at any time. We must therefore be more mindful of potential dangers, be prepared to deal with worst-case scenarios, and be ready to withstand high winds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms. On the journey ahead, we must firmly adhere to the following major principles.\n\nUpholding and strengthening the Party's overall leadership. We must resolutely uphold the Party Central Committee's authority and its centralized, unified leadership and see that Party leadership is exercised in all aspects and every stage of the endeavors of the Party and the country. This will ensure that our Party always remains the pillar that the Chinese people can lean on in times of difficulty, that our socialist modernization advances along the right path, and that we have the political cohesion and confidence in our development to inspire the people to strive in unity. It will see us forming a mighty force to overcome all difficulties with one heart and one mind.\n\nFollowing the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must continue to pursue economic development as our central task, uphold the Four Cardinal Principles,[ The Four Cardinal Principles are keeping to the path of socialism, upholding the people's democratic dictatorship, upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.] remain committed to reform and opening up, and stay independent and self-reliant. We must keep to our path and not sway in our commitment. We must not return to the isolation and rigidity of the past, or veer off course by changing our nature or abandoning our system. We must develop our country and our nation with our own strength, and we must maintain a firm grasp on the future of China's development and progress.\n\nApplying a people-centered development philosophy. We must protect the people's fundamental interests, improve their wellbeing, and work tirelessly to ensure that development is for the people and by the people and that its fruits are shared by the people. We must do a better job of seeing that the gains of modernization benefit all our people fairly.\n\nRemaining committed to deepening reform and opening up. We must intensify efforts to advance reform and explore new ground, and we must remain steadfast in expanding opening up. We must work hard to remove deep-seated institutional barriers so as to fully tap into the strengths of socialism with Chinese characteristics and continuously imbue our socialist modernization endeavors with fresh dynamism and vitality. We must do better in translating our country's institutional strengths into effective governance.\n\nCarrying forward our fighting spirit. We must foster a firmer sense of purpose, fortitude, and self-belief in the whole Party and the Chinese people so that we cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, or cowed by pressure. We must meet obstacles and difficulties head on, ensure both development and security, and dig deep to surmount the difficulties and challenges on the road ahead. Let us harness our indomitable fighting spirit to open up new horizons for our cause.\n\nComrades,\n\nToday, we are closer, more confident, and more capable than ever of reaching the goal of rejuvenating the Chinese nation. At the same time, we must be prepared to work even harder to get there. All of us in the Party must forge ahead with confidence and determination; proactively identify, respond to, and steer changes and prevent and defuse risks; and keep on striving to secure new successes in building a modern socialist China in all respects.\n\nIV. Accelerating the Creation of a New Development Pattern and Pursuing High-Quality Development\n\nTo build a modern socialist country in all respects, we must, first and foremost, pursue high-quality development. Development is our Party's top priority in governing and rejuvenating China, for without solid material and technological foundations, we cannot hope to build a great modern socialist country in all respects. We must fully and faithfully apply the new development philosophy on all fronts, continue reforms to develop the socialist market economy, promote high-standard opening up, and accelerate efforts to foster a new pattern of development that is focused on the domestic economy and features positive interplay between domestic and international economic flows.\n\nPursuing high-quality development as our overarching task, we will make sure that our implementation of the strategy to expand domestic demand is integrated with our efforts to deepen supply-side structural reform; we will boost the dynamism and reliability of the domestic economy while engaging at a higher level in the global economy; and we will move faster to build a modernized economy. We will raise total factor productivity, make China's industrial and supply chains more resilient and secure, and promote integrated urban-rural development and coordinated regional development, so as to effectively upgrade and appropriately expand China's economic output.\n\n1. Building a high-standard socialist market economy\n\nWe must uphold and improve China's basic socialist economic systems. We must unswervingly consolidate and develop the public sector and unswervingly encourage, support, and guide the development of the non-public sector. We will work to see that the market plays the decisive role in resource allocation and that the government better plays its role.\n\nWe will deepen reform of state-owned capital and state-owned enterprises (SOEs); accelerate efforts to improve the layout of the state-owned sector and adjust its structure; work to see state-owned capital and enterprises get stronger, do better, and grow bigger; and enhance the core competitiveness of SOEs.\n\nWe will provide an enabling environment for private enterprises, protect their property rights and the rights and interests of entrepreneurs in accordance with the law, and facilitate the growth of the private sector. We will improve the modern corporate system with distinctive Chinese features, encourage entrepreneurship, and move faster to help Chinese companies become world-class outfits. We will support the development of micro, small, and medium enterprises.\n\nWe will intensify reforms to streamline government administration, delegate power, improve regulation, and upgrade services. We will build a unified national market, advance reforms for the market-based allocation of production factors, and put in place a high-standard market system. We will refine the systems underpinning the market economy, such as those for property rights protection, market access, fair competition, and social credit, in order to improve the business environment.\n\nWe will improve the system of macroeconomic governance, give full play to the strategic guidance of national development plans, and enhance coordination between fiscal and monetary policies. We will work to expand domestic demand and better leverage the fundamental role of consumption in stimulating economic growth and the key role of investment in improving the supply structure. We will improve the modern budget system, optimize the tax structure, and improve the system of transfer payments.\n\nWe will deepen structural reform in the financial sector, modernize the central bank system, and strengthen and refine modern financial regulation. We will reinforce the systems that safeguard financial stability, place all types of financial activities under regulation according to the law, and ensure no systemic risks arise.\n\nWe will improve the functions of the capital market and increase the proportion of direct financing. We will take stronger action against monopolies and unfair competition, break local protectionism and administrative monopolies, and conduct law-based regulation and guidance to promote the healthy development of capital.\n\n2. Modernizing the industrial system\n\nIn pursuing economic growth, we must continue to focus on the real economy. We will advance new industrialization and move faster to boost China's strength in manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, cyberspace, and digital development. We will carry out industrial foundation reengineering projects and research projects on major technologies and equipment; support enterprises that use special and sophisticated technologies to produce novel and unique products; and move the manufacturing sector toward higher-end, smarter, and greener production.\n\nWe will consolidate our leading position in industries where we excel, work faster to shore up weaknesses in sectors vital to China's development security, and improve our capacity for securing the supply of strategic resources. We will promote the integrated and clustered development of strategic emerging industries and cultivate new growth engines such as next-generation information technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, new energy, new materials, high-end equipment, and green industry.\n\nWe will build a new system of efficient and high-quality services and promote further integration of modern services with advanced manufacturing and modern agriculture. We will accelerate development of the Internet of Things and build an efficient and smooth logistics system to help cut distribution costs.\n\nWe will accelerate the development of the digital economy, further integrate it with the real economy, and build internationally competitive digital industry clusters. We will build a modern infrastructure system with a better layout and structure, more effective functions, and greater system integration.\n\n3. Advancing rural revitalization across the board\n\nThe most challenging and arduous tasks we face in building a modern socialist China in all respects remain in our rural areas. We will continue to put agricultural and rural development first, pursue integrated development of urban and rural areas, and facilitate the flows of production factors between them. We will move faster to build up China's strength in agriculture and steadily promote the revitalization of businesses, talent, culture, ecosystems, and organizations in the countryside.\n\nWe must reinforce the foundations for food security on all fronts. We will ensure that both Party committees and governments assume responsibility for ensuring food security and that China's total area of farmland does not fall below the redline of 120 million hectares. We will work to gradually develop all permanent basic cropland into high-standard cropland. We will invigorate the seed industry, support the development of agricultural science, technology, and equipment, and refine the mechanisms for ensuring the incomes of grain growers and for compensating major grain-producing areas. With these efforts, we will ensure that China's food supply remains firmly in its own hands.\n\nWe will adopt an all-encompassing approach to food, develop protected agriculture, and build a diversified food supply system. We will foster rural industries with local features to create more channels for increasing rural incomes. We will consolidate and expand our achievements in poverty alleviation and help areas and people that have just shaken off poverty build their own momentum for growth. We will develop infrastructure and public services in rural areas in a well-planned and coordinated way and build a beautiful and harmonious countryside that is desirable to live and work in.\n\nWe will consolidate and improve the basic rural operation system, develop new rural collective economies, cultivate new types of agribusiness and commercial agricultural services, and support appropriately scaled agricultural operations. We will advance reform of the rural land system and grant farmers more adequate property rights and interests. We will safeguard the lawful land rights and interests of rural residents who have moved to urban areas and obtained permanent residency, and we will encourage law-based, voluntary, and paid transfers of such rights and interests. We will improve the systems for supporting and protecting agriculture and the rural financial services system.\n\n4.Promoting coordinated regional development\n\nWe will thoroughly implement the coordinated regional development strategy, major regional strategies, the functional zoning strategy, and the new urbanization strategy. We will improve the distribution of the major productive forces and develop a regional economic layout and a territorial space system that complement each other's strengths and promote high-quality development.\n\nWe will make further progress in the large-scale development of the western region, achieve new breakthroughs in the full revitalization of the Northeast, accelerate the rise of the central region, and encourage the eastern region to modernize more quickly.\n\nWe will support old revolutionary base areas and areas with large ethnic minority populations in speeding up development. We will promote development in border areas to boost local economies, raise local living standards, and ensure local stability.\n\nWe will promote coordinated development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the development of the Yangtze Economic Belt, the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta, and ecological conservation and high-quality development in the Yellow River basin. We will build the Xiongan New Area to a high standard and drive forward the development of the Chengdu-Chongqing economic zone.\n\nWe will improve the functional zoning system and the development of territorial space.

Invigorating China through Science and Education and Developing a Strong Workforce for the Modernization Drive\n\nEducation, science and technology, and human resources are the foundational and strategic pillars for building a modern socialist country in all respects. We must regard science and technology as our primary productive force, talent as our primary resource, and innovation as our primary driver of growth. We will fully implement the strategy for invigorating China through science and education, the workforce development strategy, and the innovation-driven development strategy. We will open up new areas and new arenas in development and steadily foster new growth drivers and new strengths.\n\nWe will continue to give high priority to the development of education, build China's self-reliance and strength in science and technology, and rely on talent to pioneer and to propel development. We will speed up work to build a strong educational system, greater scientific and technological strength, and a quality workforce. We will continue efforts to cultivate talent for the Party and the country and comprehensively improve our ability to nurture talent at home. All this will see us producing first-class innovators and attracting the brightest minds from all over.\n\n1. Developing education that meets the people's expectations\n\nEducation is of critical importance to the future of our country and our Party. What kind of people we should cultivate, how, and for whomthese are the fundamental issues that education must address.\n\nThe most basic aim of education is to foster virtue. We will fully implement the Party's educational policy, carry out the basic task of fostering virtue through education, and nurture a new generation of capable young people with sound moral grounding, intellectual ability, physical vigor, aesthetic sensibility, and work skills who will fully develop socialism and carry forward the socialist cause.\n\nWe will continue to follow a people-centered approach to developing education, move faster to build a high-quality educational system, advance students' well-rounded development, and promote fairness in education. We will accelerate high-quality, balanced development and urban-rural integration in compulsory education. We will better allocate educational resources across regions, strengthen public-benet preschool education and special needs education, ensure the diversified development of senior secondary schools, and improve the financial aid system so it covers students at all stages of schooling.\n\nWe will promote collaborative innovation in vocational education, higher education, and continuing education and promote integration between vocational education and general education, between industry and education, and between science and education. We will better establish vocational education as a category in the educational system. We will do more to develop basic disciplines, emerging disciplines, and interdisciplinary subjects and speed up the development of world-class universities and strong disciplines with Chinese features. We will better guide and regulate the development of private schools.\n\nWe will intensify efforts to promote standard spoken and written Chinese. We will advance comprehensive reform in education, strengthen the creation and management of teaching materials, refine the systems for school management and educational assessments, and improve mechanisms for school-family-society collaboration in education.\n\nWe will strengthen the professional integrity, conduct, and ability of our teachers, foster public respect for educators, and encourage public support for education. We will promote the digitalization of education and build a society and country of learning where lifelong learning is pursued by all.\n\n2. Improving systems for scientic and technological innovation\n\nInnovation will remain at the heart of China's modernization drive. We will improve the system in which the Party Central Committee exercises unified leadership over science and technology work. We will improve the new system for mobilizing resources nationwide to make key technological breakthroughs. We will boost China's strength in strategic science and technology, better allocate innovation resources, and better define the roles of national research institutes, advanced-level research universities, and leading high-tech enterprises to improve their layout. We will establish a system of national laboratories, coordinate the development of international and regional centers for scientific and technological innovation, enhance basic scientific and technological capacity, and ensure better strategic input from the science and technology sector, so as to boost the overall performance of China's innovation system.\n\nWe will deepen structural scientific and technological reform and reform of the system for appraisal of scientific and technological advances. We will increase investment in science and technology through diverse channels and strengthen legal protection of intellectual property rights, in order to establish a foundational system for all-around innovation. We will nurture a culture of innovation, encourage dedication to science, cultivate fine academic conduct, and foster an enabling environment for innovation.\n\nWe will expand science and technology exchanges and cooperation with other countries, cultivate an internationalized environment for research, and create an open and globally-competitive innovation ecosystem.\n\n3. Accelerating the implementation of the innovation-driven development strategy\n\nSetting our sights on the global frontiers of science and technology, national economic development, the major needs of the country, and the health and safety of the people, we should speed up efforts to achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology.\n\nTo meet China's strategic needs, we will concentrate resources on original and pioneering scientific and technological research to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields. In order to enhance China's innovation capacity, we will move faster to launch a number of major national projects that are of strategic, big-picture, and long-term importance. We will strengthen basic research, prioritize original innovation, and encourage researchers to engage in free exploration.\n\nTo inspire greater creativity, we will invest more effectively in science and technology and advance reform of the mechanisms for the allocation and use of government research funds. We will promote closer enterprise-led collaboration between industries, universities, and research institutes, stay goal-oriented, and promote the industrial application of scientific and technological advances. We will reinforce the principal role of enterprises in innovation, give full play to the guiding and supporting role of key high-tech enterprises, create an enabling environment for the growth of micro, small, and medium technological enterprises, and promote deeper integration of the innovation, industrial, capital, and talent chains.\n\n4. Implementing the workforce development strategy\n\nCultivating a large workforce of high-quality talent who have both integrity and professional competence is of critical importance to the long-term development of China and the Chinese nation. A wealth of talent is vital to the success of a great cause. We should follow the principle of the Party managing talent, and we should respect work, knowledge, talent, and creativity. We will adopt more proactive, open, and effective policies on talent and encourage our talent to love the Party, dedicate themselves to the country and contribute to its cause, and serve the people. We will improve the strategic distribution of human resources and make concerted efforts to cultivate talented people in all fields, so as to create a large, well-structured, and high-quality workforce.\n\nWe will move faster to build world hubs for talent and innovation, promote better distribution and balanced development of talent across regions, and strive to build up our comparative strengths in global competition for talent. We will speed up efforts to build a contingent of personnel with expertise of strategic importance and cultivate greater numbers of master scholars, science strategists, first-class scientists and innovation teams, young scientists, outstanding engineers, master craftsmen, and highly-skilled workers.\n\nWe will increase international personnel exchanges and make the best use of talent of all types to fully harness their potential. We will further reform the systems and mechanisms for talent development and ensure we value talented people, nurture them, attract them, and put them to good use. No effort should be spared and no rigid boundaries drawn in the endeavor to bring together the best and the brightest from all fields for the cause of the Party and the people.\n\nVI. Advancing Whole-Process People's Democracy and Ensuring that the People Run the Country\n\nChina is a socialist country of people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the working class based on an alliance of workers and farmers; all power of the state in China belongs to the people. People's democracy is the lifeblood of socialism, and it is integral to our efforts to build a modern socialist country in all respects. Whole-process people's democracy is the defining feature of socialist democracy; it is democracy in its broadest, most genuine, and most effective form.\n\nWe must firmly stay on the path of socialist political advancement with Chinese characteristics, uphold the unity between Party leadership, the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance, and ensure the principal position of the people, so as to give full expression to their will, protect their rights and interests, and spark their creativity.\n\nWe will improve the system of institutions through which the people run the country. We will encourage the people's orderly participation in political affairs and guarantee their ability to engage in democratic elections, consultations, decision-making, management, and oversight in accordance with the law. We will inspire the people's motivation, initiative, and creativity, so as to consolidate and develop a lively, stable, and united political atmosphere.\n\n1. Strengthening the institutions through which the people run the country\n\nWe must uphold and improve our country's foundational, basic, and important political systems, expand democratic channels, and diversify the forms of democracy, so as to ensure that people participate in various ways in the management of state, economic, cultural, and social affairs in accordance with the law.\n\nWe will support and ensure the people's exercise of state power through people's congresses, and we will ensure that people's congresses at all levels are formed through democratic elections, responsible to the people, and subject to their oversight.\n\nWe will support and ensure that people's congresses and their standing committees lawfully exercise the powers of enacting laws, conducting oversight, making decisions, and appointing and removing officials. We will improve the system under which people's congresses conduct oversight of administrative, supervisory, adjudicatory, and procuratorial organs, and we will uphold the unity, sanctity, and authority of the law.\n\nWe will see that deputies to people's congresses are better able to carry out their work and that they strengthen ties with the general public. We will improve working mechanisms for drawing on public opinion and pooling the wisdom of the people and ensure that local legislative outreach offices are well-run. We will intensify reform and development of trade unions, Chinese Communist Youth League organizations, women's federations, and other people's organizations and give full play to their role as bridges connecting the Party and the people. We will follow a Chinese path of human rights development, actively participate in global human rights governance, and promote all-around advancement of human rights.\n\n2. Fully developing consultative democracy\n\nConsultative democracy is an important way by which whole-process people's democracy is practiced. We will improve the system of consultative democracy, make coordinated efforts to promote consultations carried out by political parties, people's congresses, government departments, committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), people's organizations, communities, and social organizations, and improve various institutional consultative platforms, so as to promote extensive, multilevel, and institutionalized development of consultative democracy.\n\nWe will uphold and improve the system of CPC-led multiparty cooperation and political consultation and ensure the integration of Party leadership, the united front, and consultative democracy. We will give play to the CPPCC's role as a specialized consultative body and see that it coordinates efforts to promote democracy and unity while making proposals on state affairs and building consensus. Improvements will be made to institutions, standards, and procedures to help the CPPCC ensure that in-depth consultations and interactions are conducted, opinions are fully expressed, and broad consensus is built. Efforts will be also made to improve the systems and mechanisms through which CPPCC committees conduct democratic oversight and their members stay engaged with people from various sectors.\n\n3. Actively developing democracy at the primary level\n\nPrimary-level democracy is an important manifestation of whole-process people's democracy. We will improve the mechanism for community-level self-governance under the leadership of primary-level Party organizations, build up the strength of primary-level organizations, and improve the institutional and working systems for direct democracy at the primary level to see that urban and rural communities can more effectively manage, serve, educate, and oversee themselves.\n\nWe will increase transparency in government affairs, establish more channels for people from various sectors to participate in community-level governance in an orderly way, and ensure that the people manage public affairs and run public-interest programs at the primary level in accordance with the law.\n\nWe will rely wholeheartedly on the working class and improve the system of democratic management in enterprises and public institutions, which takes basic shape in the form of workers' congresses, so as to protect workers' lawful rights and interests.\n\n4. Consolidating and developing the broadest possible patriotic united front\n\nThe people's support is of the utmost political importance, and the united front is an effective instrument for rallying the people's support and pooling their strength. We will build a broad united front to forge great unity and solidarity, and we will encourage all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation to dedicate themselves to realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.\n\nWe will leverage the strengths of our country's new type of socialist political party system. Following the principles of long-term coexistence, mutual oversight, sincerity, and sharing the rough times and the smooth, we will strengthen our Party's unity and cooperation with other political parties and prominent figures without party affiliation. We will also support other political parties in improving themselves and performing their roles more effectively.\n\nWe will, with a focus on forging a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation, continue to take the correct and distinctively Chinese approach to handling ethnic affairs, uphold and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and improve the Party's work on ethnic affairs, so as to comprehensively promote ethnic unity and progress.\n\nWe will remain committed to the principle that religions in China must be Chinese in orientation and provide active guidance to religions so that they can adapt to socialist society. We will strengthen communication with intellectuals who are not Party members on theoretical and political issues and improve our work concerning people from emerging social groups in an effort to provide better political guidance for pursuing common goals.\n\nWe will cultivate a cordial and clean relationship between government and business across the board and facilitate the healthy development of the non-public sector and those working in it.\n\nWe will improve and strengthen our work related to Chinese nationals overseas to give shape to a powerful joint force for advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n\nVII. Exercising Law-Based Governance on All Fronts and Advancing the Rule of Law in China\n\nThe comprehensive advancement of law-based governance has been a profound revolution in China's governance. Law-based governance is important for the Party's success in governing and rejuvenating the country, for the wellbeing of the people, and for the long-term stability of the Party and the country. We must give better play to the role of the rule of law in consolidating foundations, ensuring stable expectations, and delivering long-term benefits, and we must strive to build a modern socialist country in all respects under the rule of law.\n\nWe must follow a path of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics, develop a Chinese system of socialist rule of law, and establish China as a socialist country under the rule of law. We must, with a focus on protecting and promoting social fairness and justice, pursue coordinated progress in law-based governance, law-based exercise of state power, and law-based government administration and take integrated steps to build a country, government, and society based on the rule of law. We will make all-around efforts to ensure sound legislation, strict law enforcement, impartial administration of justice, and society-wide observance of the law and see that all work of the state is carried out under the rule of law.\n\n1. Improving the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics with the Constitution at its core\n\nLaw-based governance and law-based exercise of state power begin with compliance with the Constitution. We must remain firmly committed to leadership of the Party, to the state system of people's democratic dictatorship, and to the political system of people's congresses, all of which are mandated by the Constitution. We will better implement the Constitution and conduct constitutional oversight, and we will improve the systems for ensuring full compliance with the Constitution, so as to give better play to the Constitution's important role in China's governance and uphold its authority.\n\nWe will step up legislation in key, emerging, and foreign-related fields and advance the rule of law in domestic and foreign-related affairs in a coordinated manner, so that good laws are made to promote development and ensure good governance. We will make further headway in making laws in a well-conceived and democratic way and in accordance with the law; we will take coordinated steps to enact, revise, abolish, interpret, and codify laws; and we will see that legislative work is more systematic, holistic, coordinated, and responsive. Improvements will be made to the record and review system for normative documents. We must ensure sound, democratic, and law-based decision-making and fully implement the procedural system for making major decisions.\n\n2. Steadily advancing law-based government administration\n\nBuilding a law-based government is a key task and major part of comprehensively advancing law-based governance. We will transform government functions, improve the government responsibility system and organizational structure, and establish legal footing for government institutions, functions, powers, procedures, and responsibilities, so as to enhance the efficiency and credibility of government administration. We will deepen reform of public institutions.\n\nWith regard to administrative law enforcement, we will advance structural reform to ensure that it is strict, procedure-based, impartial, and civil across the board, and we will intensify it in key areas involving the people's immediate interests. We will refine law enforcement procedures and the standards for administrative discretion, enhance oversight mechanisms and oversight capacity, and strictly implement responsibility and accountability systems. We will also improve the systems and mechanisms for coordinated law enforcement at the community level.\n\n3. Ensuring strict and impartial administration of justice\n\nAn impartial judiciary is the last line of defense for social fairness and justice. We will deepen comprehensive and integrated reform of the judicial system, fully and faithfully enforce judicial accountability, and accelerate the development of a fair, efficient, and authoritative socialist judicial system. We will see that the people feel justice has been served in each and every judicial case.\n\nWe will ensure the well-regulated exercise of judicial power and improve the systems and mechanisms that enable public security organs, procuratorates, courts, and administrative agencies for justice to perform their respective functions and to coordinate with and check one another. Checks and oversight on judicial activities will be enhanced to ensure judicial justice. Procuratorial organs will step up legal oversight, and the system of public-interest litigation will be improved.\n\n4. Stepping up efforts to establish the rule of law throughout society\n\nA society based on the rule of law is the foundation on which we can build a country under the rule of law. We will promote socialist rule of law and carry forward fine traditional Chinese legal culture, and we will encourage all our people to truly revere, readily observe, and firmly defend socialist rule of law. We will develop a modern public legal service system that covers both urban and rural populations and carry out intensive activities to raise public awareness of the rule of law. We will advance law-based governance at multiple levels and in multiple areas and enhance the rule of law in social governance. We will see that leading officials play an exemplary role and work hard to make respecting, learning about, observing, and applying the law common practice throughout society.\n\nVIII. Building Cultural Confidence and Strength and Securing New Successes in Developing Socialist Culture\n\nTo build a modern socialist country in all respects, we must develop a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics and be more confident in our culture. In our efforts to turn China into a country with a strong socialist culture, we will focus on upholding socialism with Chinese characteristics, rallying public support, fostering a new generation of young people, developing Chinese culture, and better presenting China to the world. We will develop a sound, people-oriented socialist culture for our nation that embraces modernization, the world, and the future. We will ignite the cultural creativity of the entire nation and build a powerful source of inspiration for realizing national rejuvenation.\n\nWe should uphold the foundational system for ensuring the guiding role of Marxism in the ideological domain. We will ensure that culture serves the people and serves socialism. We will follow the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and we will encourage creative transformation and innovative development of traditional Chinese culture. Guided by the core socialist values, we will develop advanced socialist culture, promote revolutionary culture, and carry forward fine traditional Chinese culture. In doing so, we will be well-placed to meet people's ever-growing intellectual and cultural needs, consolidate a common intellectual foundation for the whole Party and all Chinese people to strive in unity, and continuously grow China's cultural soft power and the appeal of Chinese culture.\n\n1. Developing a socialist ideology that has the power to unite and inspire the people\n\nIdeological work is about forging the character of a country and the soul of a nation. We must ensure that the Party firmly exercises leadership over this work and that the responsibility system for it is fully implemented. We will cement and expand the mainstream thoughts and ideas that inspire hard work in the new era.\n\nWe will refine the working systems for arming Party members, educating the people, and guiding our practice with the Party's new theories. We will make further progress in the project to study and develop Marxist theory. In philosophy and the social sciences, we will work faster to develop Chinese systems for fields of study, academia, and discourse, and we will cultivate a pool of talented philosophers and social scientists.\n\nWe will improve the systems for communications across all forms of media and create a new environment of mainstream public opinion. We will improve the system for conducting comprehensive cyberspace management and foster a healthy online environment.\n\n2. Extensively applying the core socialist values\n\nThe core socialist values have immense power to rally the people's support and pool their strength. We will carry forward the long line of inspiring principles for the Chinese Communists that originated with the great founding spirit of the Party; put resources related to the Party's heritage to great use; conduct extensive public awareness activities to promote the core socialist values; enhance commitment to patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; and foster a new generation of young people to shoulder the mission of realizing national rejuvenation.\n\nWe will develop and institutionalize regular activities to foster ideals and convictions, and we will carry out public awareness initiatives on the history of the Party, the People's Republic of China, reform and opening up, and the development of socialism, in order to foster love for the Party and the country. These efforts will help strengthen the people's commitment to our common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nWe will draw on the core socialist values to forge inner strength and inspire our people, improve the system of theoretical and political work, and integrate the political education curriculum across all levels, from elementary schools to universities.\n\nWe will uphold both the rule of law and the rule of virtue and see that the core socialist values are incorporated into efforts to advance the rule of law, into social development, and into th",

                "cc_text": "After months during which food prices rose at rates not seen in a generation or more, the founders of several food waste apps active in Central and Southeast Europe say they have seen a sudden upturn in the number of users.\n\nFood waste apps have been around for a few years now, with users motivated by a combination of seeking to reduce their environmental impact food production is a massive contributor to emissions and a worryingly large amount of food is wasted and the need for those on tight budgets to find cheap (or free) food to feed themselves and their families.\n\nThe world is now into a second year of strongly rising food and energy prices, a trend that started as the global economy started recovering from the coronacrisis, followed by a sharp acceleration after the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine, two of the worlds top wheat exporters. Making the situation even worse, much of Europe was affected by drought this summer.\n\nToday, the rising cost of living is pushing households into poverty as prices of food and energy increase, and in response more people are turning turn to apps redistributing unwanted food to those that can use it. As part of this international trend, there are a number of apps in the Central and Southeast Europe region that have been growing in popularity recently.\n\nAlbert Wettstein, co-founder of Hungarian app Munch, says there has been an increase in take-up of the app amid high inflation and shortages. To date, 300,000 people have downloaded the app in Hungary, and more than 240,000 meals have been saved from the bin, a number that is growing day by day.\n\nIn Hungary, where Munch is based, inflation jumped to a 24-year high in August, reaching 15.6%. Commenting on the causes of the crisis, Gergely Gulyas, the prime minister's chief of staff, said the following month that the war in Ukraine and the related sanctions had led to \"a brutal rise in energy prices\", leading in turn to soaring food products. That prompted the government to extend the price caps on basic foodstuffs and fuel until the end of 2022.\n\nIts a similar situation in Serbia, where startup EatMeApp has developed a smart assistant that helps users make educated decisions about how and when to use their food. The companys co-founder, Aleksandra Lazovic-Lnningen, told bne IntelliNews in an interview earlier this year: \"[The] unfortunate times that we are witnessing are rising awareness about personal financial sustainability.\" Serbias government too has imposed price caps on a range of basic foodstuffs and restricted exports.\n\nIn Bulgaria, where Foody.to helps redistribute unwanted food as well as sharing inspiring content for local foodies, consumer prices increased by 17.7% year on year in August, pushed up by a 24.1% y/y hike in food prices. Meanwhile, incomes are failing to keep pace with the sharp increase in consumer spending.\n\nOver the last few years a number of other food waste and food sharing apps have launched and subsequently folded. Now, the financial squeeze has caused a fundamental shift in attitudes. \"Most startup founders spend plenty of time building their products, making some plans and elaborating on complex and long-term strategies. However, fewer founders really ask themselves the most important question: Is their product really coming at the perfect time?\" says Gregoire Vigroux, co-founder of Romanias Bonapp.eco.\n\nHe and his partners launched Bonapp.eco in November 2021 \"in the midst of the coronavirus storm, when food prices had started to increase significantly\". Since then the increase has accelerated. In August 2022, food prices saw their fastest increase since the 1989 revolution this August, shooting up by 18.2% y/y. As a result, Vigroux says, \"I believe the timing of Bonapp.eco is just perfect.\" To date, the app has 40,000 downloads and is eyeing further expansion.\n\nHow the apps work\n\nThe apps launched in the region have a variety of different methods, but most source unwanted food from shops and eateries and make it available to consumers via their apps cheaply (or in some cases for free).\n\n\"Our mobile app addresses the problems of food waste and inflation, by connecting users with local food retailers, including grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, bakeries, coffee shops and hotels,\" Vigroux explains.\n\n\"Through the app, users can purchase food that is approaching its expiration date, at a discount from 50% to 80%. Our mission is to turn the environmental, economic and social challenges caused by food waste into a sustainable business opportunity to the benefit of everyone.\"\n\nSimilarly, Munch, founded by Wettstein and three fellow university students, makes it possible for bakeries, restaurants, shops and other venues to sell or donate their unsold food at a discounted price via the app.\n\nBulgarias Foody.to was launched by two sisters Svetoslava (Sissi) and Denitsa Simeonovi at the beginning of 2021 with the aim of reducing hospitality food waste. The pair had previously started the successful Sofia2Go Instagram food blog, and according to Sissi Simeonovi, Foody.to the first platform of its kind in Bulgaria \"is not only a platform for reducing food waste, but it is also a foody guide for the best places to eat, drink and enjoy in Sofia, Varna and several other Bulgarian cities (to be announced soon). People like to save food, but they like even more to explore, so we provide them with both opportunities.\"\n\nSerbia-based EatMeApp is rather different, as it is a smart assistant aimed at consumers. \"Most of the food waste apps are targeting businesses such as restaurants and grocery shops, offering users to decrease waste on the business side. We solve household food waste so, we are on the side of the citizens,\" adds Lazovic-Lnningen. \"Why? Because we believe that most important and numerous agent[s] of change are us People, citizens.\"\n\nFood for all\n\nIn Emerging Europe in particular the motivation for using food waste apps is more likely to be financial than in the richer Western countries, where environmental sustainability is more of a factor, though for many users both issues pushed them to install apps to help reduce food waste. And these days, even in the affluent West the cost of living crisis is driving more people to food banks and other sources of free and cheap food.\n\nSky-high food prices arent likely to ease any time soon. According to a World Bank update on September 15, food price inflation remains high around the world, affecting almost all low-income and middle-income countries, and most high-income countries too. \"The war in Ukraine has altered global patterns of trade, production and consumption of commodities in ways that will keep prices at high levels through the end of 2024, exacerbating food insecurity and inflation,\" commented the World Bank.\n\n\"Not only are consumers looking at cheaper food alternatives, but also, they are increasingly driven by eco-friendly consumer behaviours,\" said Vigroux. He points to data showing around 5mn tonnes of food are thrown away every year in Romania. Yet at the same time, Romanian consumers devote almost 40% of their budget to food and beverages, compared to only 10% in France and Germany. \"And food prices in Romania are booming!\" he stressed.\n\nA survey of 100 Bonapp.eco users revealed that 70% were primarily driven by making savings, whereas 30% use the app to have a positive impact on the environment. \"I believe the number of consumers using bonapp.eco to have a positive impact on the environment is going to increase, as I see environmental awareness rising like never before in Romania,\" he comments.\n\nWhile Romania is one of the poorest EU countries, the Western Balkan countries including Serbia lag further behind economically.\n\n\"Western Balkan users recognise the food waste problem through the financial angle and hunger, while European user [does so] as the climate problem,\" commented Lazovic-Lnningen.\n\n\"If there can be any good in these serious and challenging times that we are living pressure to live more sustainably is one of those moments.\"\n\nThe profile of Foody.tos users is somewhat different. \"We have seen a rise in users due to many reasons the fact that our platform becomes more popular because more and more businesses recognise the need to join us and indeed more and more clients seek to save money and well, save the planet,\" said Simeonovi.\n\n\"Our clients are not so motivated by the lower prices, though this is an important factor, too, as they want to discover new tasty places and support a meaningful cause,\" she added. \"We are happy that we created a community of foodies who care for the food not to be wasted and are ready to support emerging businesses like ours in times when it is not easy to develop such a platform.\"\n\nReducing food waste\n\nAt the same time, there is growing awareness of the huge amount of food that is produced and then wasted, and the environmental impact of this.\n\nAccording to Simeonovi, Foody.to was inspired by a combination of the sisters appreciation of good food and the realisation of the massive food waste problem. \"During the months before the launch, it was hard to get any proper data on food waste,\" commented Simeonovi. By talking to numerous chefs and shop owners, the two realised what a big issue food waste is in Bulgaria and how important it is to fight it.\n\nA recent study by the NGO Feedback EU showed that the EU imported almost 138mn tonnes of agricultural products in 2021, at a cost of 150bn, but in the same year it wasted an estimated 153.5mn tonnes of food. The figure is considerably higher than official EU statistics that exclude most on-farm food waste. According to the report, an estimated 20% of EU food production is currently wasted, and wasted food is responsible for at least 6% of the EUs total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\n\"At a time of high food prices and a cost-of-living crisis, its a scandal that the EU is potentially throwing away more food than its importing,\" commented Frank Mechielsen, executive director at Feedback EU, at the launch of the report in September.\n\nAccording to Munchs Wettstein, one third of food is wasted in Hungary or about 1.8mn tonnes per year (tpy), or 67kg per person. \"This is less than in the US but higher than some of the other European countries. Prices are increasing insanely but we are still throwing away too much food. If the food we threw away went to people in need, we could end hunger,\" Wettstein said.\n\nBoth he and Lazovic-Lnningen reflected on the generational change in attitudes to food in the region.\n\n\"After high school one of our founders used to go and sit in a bakery and at the end of the day they would collect the unsold produce, put it in a bag and throw it away. It hurts to see something like this. My grandparents were in a Soviet labour camp and food was sacred,\" said Wettstein.\n\n\"My generation is able to buy as much as we need. However, priorities have changed because of the huge inflation and shortages, which helped people understand the need to be careful. Now, 300,000 people have downloaded the app in Hungary.\"\n\n\"Our grandmothers and their attitude about food are our inspiration. They built into our DNA that throwing food is not under any circumstances a reasonable thing to do,\" Lazovic-Lnningen said. \"So one day in front of the open refrigerator it struck me while I was getting ready to throw away a chicken filet (again!) what if we have an app that sends reminders about food expiration dates? Eat Me App conceptually grew since then, but its core mission is to assist people in making conscious and educated food consumption decisions.\"\n\nCommenting on the scale of the problem, she added: \"Food waste is the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter It is a systemic problem.\" She cited data showing that household food waste accounts for 60% of total food waste, with the average family of four throwing away 30-50 of food every week.\n\nBeyond business\n\nOne thing that stood out from all of the interviewees was that the founders of the apps are passionate about what they are doing, and this goes beyond creating a business. They also talked about creating a community and changing peoples habits for the better.\n\n\"Eat Me App has for a mission a permanent shift in peoples behaviour toward food. The business as usual model is unacceptable. Our vision is conscious and aware citizens when we talk about food related habits,\" Lazovic-Lnningen explained.\n\nAs well as the service it offers via the app, Munch aims to help its users become more sustainable. \"We see sustainability as not just environmental sustainability. We want to encourage democratic sustainability for everyone, with low barrier-solutions,\" said Wettstein. \"For example, Munch is popular in Hungary on TikTok and Instagram, where we share tips on how to be more sustainable in everyday life. We post recipes to use seasonal fruit and vegetables, or educational tips such as on the difference between expiry and best before dates one big reason for food waste.\"\n\nFounders of food waste apps interviewed by bne IntelliNews also outlined ambitious expansion plans.\n\nMunch already has a team of 20 and is working on expansion to other regions, cities and countries in the region. \"Our goal is to build the biggest food waste company fighting hunger, high prices and food waste in the Central and Eastern Europe region,\" said Wettstein. The company is currently exploring potential collaboration with companies in the Czech Republic.\n\nLazovic-Lnningen names \"going global\" as one of the Eat Me Apps founders ambitions. After organic growth among early adopters, it launched a user acquisition strategy over the summer.\n\nVigroux said Bonapp.eco's ambition is to \"create the best food waste mobile app in Europe\". When the team reaches this goal, and also has 1,000 affiliates in Romania, \"we will do a new fundraising to deploy across Eastern Europe, and become the leading player in the region,\" he added.\n\nThe company is currently building up its network of affiliates, and has already sealed deals with ten of the top 12 food retailers in Romania. These will add to the 500 partners local food retailers, including grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, bakeries, coffee shops and hotels it has on-boarded so far.\n\nThe energy crisis has already encouraged governments to look at new investments into renewables as a way of boosting domestic generation and long-term energy security. Meanwhile, as the food crisis continues the World Bank does not expect an easing of food prices until the end of next year a similar change may be on the verge of happening in the food industry. Rising prices and fears of shortages are causing consumers to look not just to the thrifty ways of the past but also to the apps of the future.",

It offers direct employment to over 1.2 million persons in the country. Through its forward and backward linkages, another 10 million people derive their livelihood from the Indian tea industry. For these and other reasons, promoting long-term health, well-being and the environmental sustainability of our much-beloved tea sector should be a priority. However, the tea sector is experiencing a sustainability crisis, stemming from continuous low prices of tea squeezing the large and small tea producers.\n\nTime and again, we come across theories that the smallholder tea growers (STGs) are the primary beneficiary of this growth in the production and consumption of tea. Such opinions use the logic that smallholders have young bushes, more productivity, and no social and statutory obligations. Therefore, they could produce more tea and after processing by the Bought Leaf Factories, they could sell it at cheaper rates. Unfortunately, this theory overlooks many other dimensions. The STG segment often works with their family labour and takes enormous financial risks. Even when we keep the opportunity costs aside, as per some analysts, the average cost of production for an STG would not be less than Rs 15 per kilo of green leaf in Assam. The STGs have an average landholding of less than one hectare and roughly produce an annual average of 11,000 kilos to 13,500 of green leaf per hectare.\n\nThe economic challenges are inextricably linked to the tea industrys environmental and social challenges. According to preliminary evaluations by the Tea Research Association (TRA), climate change is having a substantial influence on tea producers since tea is mostly cultivated in rain-fed mono-cropping systems, and weather conditions affect optimal growth. According to the study, unless we adopt appropriate adaptation steps, tea may not exist on the Assam plains by 2050. Excessive rains cause topsoil erosion, which has a detrimental influence on productivity. Producers must purchase more fertilisers to maintain soil fertility and use more insecticides to combat rising pests. It not only raises the cost of tea production, but it also has an impact on food safety, which is one of the top buying concerns for most packers.\n\nYou may also like to read: FICCI-GFI India to establish smart protein as a key pillar of Indias green economy\n\nOn the social front, the north-Indian tea estates are barely meeting their statutory and wage requirements but the quantity of informal work in the tea industry is growing. The social progress of the tea workers community who have a higher aspiration due to access to global information today, has been relatively plodding. It is obvious that non-remunerative pricing in the tea-producing segment would make reaching the Sustainable Development objectives difficult in tea areas.\n\nStakeholders in the Indian tea industry must acknowledge the significant sustainability concerns, particularly considering the present pricing crisis and impending climate crisis, by:\n\nIncreasing tea producers profitability- RTGs (regulated tea gardens) and STGs (smallholder tea growers) The structural developments in the Indian tea industry have generated new obstacles for many farmers, but they have also offered up new opportunities. The combination of STGs and RTGs, as well as the mainstreaming of e-commerce technology and mobile applications for farmers, give exceptional opportunities to depart from the traditional tea business model, which has grown more unsustainable for many tea producers. I believe that RTGs and STGs operating on the same platform should evaluate three distinct possibilities.\n\nTo begin, RTGs-STGs should work with the Indian government to establish minimum benchmark pricing for various grades of manufactured tea to stimulate sector growth and exports. Following a comprehensive analysis, the minimal benchmark price should be based on a cost-plus model. Similarly, there should be an engagement for setting up a benchmark pricing for acceptable standard of quality of green leaves. The RTGs and STGs collective action would transform tea in India from a buyers product to a sellers product, establishing new quality and pricing norms for domestic markets.\n\nYou may also like to read: Enabling climate-resilient agriculture with agritech\n\nSecondly, RTGs and STGs should consider expanding beyond tea production and manufacturing. However, several entities handle tea between the producer and the consumer, adding and capturing value along the way. It raises the question of whether some of the intermediaries can be \"cut out.\" Nonetheless, the main entities throughout the value chain all provide essential functions or offer specific value that transforms green leaves into tea bags in our cups. A relevant concern is whether producers can take on more of these steps and associated efforts (such as marketing) to create and capture more value?\n\nThirdly, e-commerce and the internet have the potential to reduce market concentration and give a platform for producers to add and gain more value through more direct-to-consumer sales models. Direct-to-consumer models, while now niche, have the potential to expand with continued institutional support. It might entail aggregating producers to achieve economies of scale, as well as making administrative and logistical factors viable for many producers. Producer associations might perhaps provide some of the necessary institutional support. Of course, conventional offline markets will continue to be important in the coming years. However, digital traceability, as provided by the Trinitea programme, would promote product distinction, and alliances with global NGOs would allow for a different type of brand building for producers in both domestic and export markets.\n\nAs a result, as the next decade unfolds, tea producer associations will progressively become tea marketing associations.\n\nEven efficient tea producers will struggle to stay competitive under existing and future market conditions, which include persistently low pricing, growing input costs, and destructive climate change consequences, and the SDG gap in tea-producing regions of Northern India will widen. Sustainability certificates are ill-equipped to address these problems. The way forward is sustained collective action by STGs and RTGs to establish a pre-competitive platform with a common fund to address climate-adaptive tea production, a greater role for premier producers organisations in marketing value-added quality tea in India and abroad. The tea industrys growth is dependent on healthy and viable farmers, particularly smallholders; one thing is certain: this business-as-usual scenario is not sustainable for workers, brands, or the tea industry.\n\n(Dr. Shatadru Chattopadhayay is the Managing Director of Solidaridad for Asia, an international civil society organisation.

The use of these drones, which dive-bomb targets and are destroyed in the process, has instilled terror in Ukrainian cities far from the frontlines, including Kyiv, Vinnytsia, and Odesa (2). Additionally, the Ukrainian foreign minister has proposed cutting diplomatic ties with Tehran in response to the use of Iranian-made drones in these attacks (7).

                "summary": "Iran's alleged supply of Shahed-136 kamikaze drones to Russia marks a significant development in the ongoing conflict, as it suggests a form of military partnership between Tehran and Moscow, with Iran providing not only the weaponry but also technical support for their operation (1,2). The drones have been used by Russia in attacks against Ukraine, targeting infrastructure and civilians, with claims from Kyiv of around 400 drones already deployed from an order of approximately 2,000 (1). Despite Iran's denial of involvement, evidence and statements from U.S. officials and Ukrainian President Zelensky indicate that Iran has indeed supplied these drones to Russia, which could potentially alter the dynamics of the conflict if used in larger numbers or in strategic ways (3,4). Moreover, the Kremlin's denial of using Iranian drones contrasts with reports from Iranian officials and diplomats, who have acknowledged promises to deliver more drones and missiles to Russia, further implicating Iran in the escalation of the conflict (4,5).",
                "more_detailed": "Iran's alleged involvement in supplying kamikaze drones to Russia is significant because it introduces a new dynamic to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with potential implications for the balance of power on the battlefield (1). These drones, identified as Iranian Shahed-136 drones, are effectively used in suicide attacks on infrastructure and civilian targets (1,2). Western countries and Ukraine accuse Iran of providing these drones and technical support to Russia, with Ukrainian officials claiming that about 400 drones have already been used from an order of roughly 2,000 (1,2). The United States has also reported Iranian military experts on the ground in Russian-occupied Crimea to assist in these operations (6). Moscow's acquisition of these drones has sparked international concern as they could pose a significant threat if used in greater numbers or integrated more effectively with Russian military operations (2).\n\nDespite Tehran's denials of supplying weapons to Russia, evidence presented by Ukraine and reported by US officials suggests otherwise (4,7,8). The White House has even stated that Iranian troops are present in Crimea to help launch the drones against Ukraine (9). This involvement is seen as a significant escalation, with the drones causing civilian casualties and damaging infrastructure (2,6,7). The Kremlin's alleged use of Iranian drones, if confirmed, could potentially alter the nature of the conflict, enhancing Russian capabilities to conduct asymmetrical warfare and raising questions about the broader geopolitical consequences of Iran's engagement in the conflict (1,6). The international community, particularly Western nations, views this development with apprehension, discerning Iran's role as an emerging supplier of military technology to Russia as a complicating factor in the already multifaceted war in Ukraine (1,3,5)."

                "more_detailed": "The strategic importance of the cities targeted by 'kamikaze' drone strikes, such as Kyiv, Dnipro, and Mykolaiv, is multifaceted. Kyiv, as Ukraine's capital, is central to the country's governance and morale, making it a symbolic target (7). Dnipro and Mykolaiv are significant due to their locations and roles in the country's economy and infrastructure (10). Kherson, another key city, controls the only land route to the annexed Crimea peninsula and the mouth of the Dnipro River, making it vital for supply routes and strategic movements (2,3). The attacks on critical infrastructure, particularly power stations, aim to cause blackouts and cripple the civilian infrastructure, exerting pressure on Ukraine's government and population (9,10).\n\nThese attacks align with Russia's broader military objectives by attempting to weaken Ukraine's resolve and create a humanitarian crisis, thus indirectly impacting Ukraine's military capabilities (6,8). The use of 'kamikaze' drones, which are designed to be destroyed upon impact, illustrates a strategy to inflict damage while minimizing the risk to Russian personnel (1). The focus on civilian targets and infrastructure, rather than military objectives, suggests a shift in tactics to terrorize the population, as military targets require precision that these drones lack (4,8). This is consistent with the approach of Russia's new commander, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, known for his civilian-focused military strategies (6). Despite these efforts, experts contend that while the drone strikes increase casualties and damage, they are unlikely to change the overall course of the war (7)."

However, Israel, while supporting Ukraine through humanitarian aid, has been cautious in providing military aid due to its sensitive relationship with Moscow (3,6,7). The UK has also sanctioned Iranian entities and individuals in response to Iran's role in supplying drones to Russia for use in Ukraine, reflecting a form of indirect support by attempting to curb the drone supply chain (10). Other Western countries, like those in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, are involved in discussions about protecting Ukraine's airspace, but the actual delivery of air defense capabilities seems to be lagging (4). Iran's involvement in supplying drones used by Russia has been condemned by Western nations, with calls for a UN investigation, signifying diplomatic support for Ukraine's cause against the use of such drones (9)."

Additionally, Ukraine has been actively requesting more air defense systems and ammunition from its allies to strengthen its defense against the increased use of kamikaze drones by Russia (3). Moreover, Ukraine is developing its own technology to counteract the strikes from these drones, although specific details on these technologies have not been disclosed (5).",

Ukraine's air defense forces are also reported to be successfully taking down the majority of the Shahed drones, indicating that existing systems are being adapted to counter this new threat (6).\n\nFurthermore, Ukraine has requested more air defense systems and ammunition from its allies in response to the increased use of kamikaze drones by Russia, and some Western countries have begun to provide more modern equipment to bolster Ukraine's capabilities (3,9). The country has also been using radar decoys to mislead any potential anti-radiation seekers that the drones may have, and due to the drones' slow speed and low altitude, they are vulnerable to being shot down by shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles like the Stinger or anti-aircraft guns such as the Gepard (2). These combined efforts reflect Ukraine's multi-layered approach to countering the kamikaze drone threat."

                "cc_text": "Ukraine has repeatedly asked its allies to supply it with more air defense systems and ammunition after Russia stepped up its use of \"kamikaze drones\" in its brutal assault against the country. Kyiv says Moscow has used Iranian-supplied kamikaze drones in strikes against Kyiv, Vinnytsia,Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and other cities across Ukraine in recent weeks, and pleaded with Western countries to step up their assistance in the face of the new challenge. Drones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since Moscow acquired the new drones from Iran over the summer. What are kamikaze drones? Kamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system. They are known as a loitering munition because they are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only striking once an enemy asset is identified. They are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance. Why are they called \"Kamikaze\"? The name \"kamikaze\" refers to the fact that the drones are disposable. Unlike more traditional, larger and faster military drones that return to base after dropping missiles, Kamikaze drones are designed to crash into a target and explode, detonating their warhead and destroying the drones in process. Which drones is Russia using in Ukraine? The Ukrainian military andUS intelligence say Russia is using Iranian-made attack drones. US officials told CNN in July that Iran had begun showcasing Shahed series drones to Russia at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran the previous month. The drones are capable of carrying precision-guided missiles and have a payload of approximately 50 kilograms (110 pounds). In August, US officials saidRussia had bought these dronesand was training its forces how to use them. According to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran. Iran has denied supplying weapons to Russia: But evidence points to the contrary. Ukraine claimed its forces had shot down one of these drones for the first time last month near the city of Kupyansk in Kharkiv. There have been more reported attacks since then. Kyiv's military said Wednesday it had downed 17 Shahed-136 drones that day alone. According to photos released by Ukrainian authorities, Russia has rebranded the Shaheds and is using them under the name of \"Geran.\" US officials say there has been \"some evidence already\" that the Iranian drones \"have already experienced numerous failures\" on the battlefield.

In an earlier post, the military said 12 drones in total had been taken out. CNN cannot independently confirm the Ukrainian military's claims. Ukraine has been facing a wide assault on critical infrastructure and power sources this week involving drones and cruise missiles. What are \"kamikaze\" drones? Unlike more traditional, larger and faster military drones that return to base after dropping missiles, \"kamikaze\" drones are designed to crash into a target and explode, detonating their warhead and destroying the drones in the process. The Ukrainian military and US intelligence say Russia is using Iranian-made attack drones. US officials told CNN in July that Iran had begun showcasing Shahed series drones to Russia at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran the previous month. In August, US officials said Russia had bought these drones and was training its forces how to use them. According to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran.",

                "cc_text": "Israels balancing act over Ukraine grows trickier after drone strikes\n\nBy Tom Bateman BBC Middle East Correspondent\n\nReuters\n\nUkraine says Russia is using Iranian-made drones to attack cities and civilian infrastructure\n\nIsrael has repeated its long-standing refusal to sell air defence weapons to Ukraine despite a fresh appeal from Kyiv after this week's \"kamikaze\" drone strikes.\n\nThe weapons unleashed by Russia were reportedly Shahed-136 drones supplied by Iran - causing Kyiv to make a fresh demand for help saying Tehran's \"complicity\" should be a \"red line\" for Israel.\n\nIsrael and Iran are avowed enemies, but the Israelis have so far refrained from providing Ukraine with weapons in a bid to maintain relations with Moscow.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel's Defence Minister Benny Gantz said their position had not changed.\n\n\"Our policy toward Ukraine is clear - we are on the side of the West, we provided humanitarian aid, took care of refugees and the wounded,\" he told Israel's Kan radio.\n\n\"For obvious reasons, we did not want to involve ourselves in combat systems. This was the policy until now. I am careful about this matter.\"\n\nSpeaking later to EU diplomats, Mr Gantz said: \"We will not provide weapon systems.\"\n\nEPA\n\nBenny Gantz says Israel will support Ukraine with humanitarian aid and life-saving defensive equipment\n\nAt least eight people were killed in Monday's explosive drone attacks in Ukraine.\n\nThe US believes the drones - or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - were transferred from Iran to Russia in violation of a United Nations resolution linked to the Iran nuclear deal, which bars transfers of certain military technologies. Iran denies supplying the drones to Moscow.\n\nAfter the attacks Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the country would request air defence systems from Israel \"without delay\".\n\n\"Now that Iran has effectively become an accomplice in the crime of aggression against Ukraine, I think that if there is anyone in Israel who is still unsure about whether or not to help Ukraine, this hesitation should now dissipate,\" he said.\n\n\"The same drones that are destroying Ukraine today are also aimed at Israel,\" he added.\n\n'Freedom of action' in Syria\n\nMonday's UAV strikes followed a growing number of Russian missile attacks against Ukrainian cities.\n\nThe issue of air defences rose to the top of the agenda at meetings in Brussels last week of Nato defence ministers, who said countering Russian strikes would require a patchwork of systems.\n\nReuters\n\nIran has officially denied supplying Russia with drones such as the Shahed-136 for use in Ukraine\n\nNato countries have been supplying Ukraine with defensive weapons since the start of the war, while the US and Europe recently pledged to send more advanced systems.\n\nDuring a speech to the Israeli parliament in March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pressured lawmakers to help, saying: \"Everybody knows that your missile defence systems are the best.\"\n\nIsrael's best known air defences are its Iron Dome batteries, jointly developed with the US, which are primarily used to shoot down short-range rockets fired by Palestinian militants. During recent conflicts with militants in Gaza the system has intercepted around 90% of projectiles that crossed into Israeli territory and were headed for populated areas, according to the military.\n\nReuters\n\nUkraine is highly interested in obtaining the Iron Dome missile defence system from Israel\n\nBut analysts say it would have limited effectiveness in Ukraine, whose land mass is around 30 times that of Israel, and which Russia targets with much longer-range weapons, including cruise missiles.\n\nIsrael's reluctance to be drawn into weapons sales to Ukraine - even amid Iran's reported arming of Russia - stems from the impact it believes the decision could have in the Middle East.\n\nIsrael effectively treats Russia like a neighbouring power with whom it \"walks on eggshells\", according to the Israeli military analyst Alex Fishman.\n\nRussia has controlled much of the airspace over Israel's northern neighbour Syria since it entered the civil war in 2015 to prop up President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Israel frequently launches air strikes into Syria targeting Iranian proxy fighters and Iranian weapons transfers to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\n\n\"The Russians are sitting on our borders, in the Golan mountains, in Syria and along the Mediterranean shores, the navies are close all the time. Israel [can't] be in an open conflict with the Russians,\" Mr Fishman told the BBC.\n\nIsrael's military informs Russia ahead of impending air strikes in Syria, involving a hotline officially known as \"the Russian-Israeli joint work group on prevention of dangerous incidents in Syria\".\n\nAFP\n\nRussian troops are stationed in Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad's government\n\nPreserving this - what is known in Israel as military \"freedom of action\" in Syria - has been a priority for Israel's security establishment. Its concern, among others, is that aggravating Moscow would lead to further Iranian entrenchment in Syria, and advanced weapons getting to Hezbollah.\n\nWhen an Israeli government minister at the weekend called for Israel to help arm Ukraine, the leadership got a flavour of how Moscow might respond.\n\n\"It will destroy the relations between [Russia and Israel],\" said Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIsraeli officials did not comment on a media report on Wednesday that claimed Israel had not carried out strikes in Syria for over a month. The report led some to question whether its co-ordination with Moscow had deteriorated.\n\nConcern for Jewish community\n\nIsrael was also pressured again by President Zelensky, who last month spoke of his \"shock\" that \"Israel did not provide us with anything. Nothing. Zero.\"\n\nMr Fishman, the military analyst, said Israel's historical ties with both Russia and Ukraine were as much of a consideration as the diplomatic and military constraints.\n\n\"The first priority for Israeli foreign policy is the Jewish community,\" he said.\n\nIsrael has seen an influx of more than a million Jews from the former Soviet Union since its collapse in 1989.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine triggered a mass migration of at least one in eight of Russia's remaining Jewish population - by August 20,500 of Russia's estimated total of 165,000 Jews had emigrated to Israel.\n\nAFP\n\nRussia's justice ministry has gone to court in a bid to shut down the Russian branch of the Jewish Agency\n\nUkraine also has one of the biggest Jewish communities in Europe. An estimated 15,000 Ukrainian refugees are living in Israel, about a third of whom have qualified for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return through having at least one Jewish grandparent.\n\nBut the Jewish Agency, which facilitates migration of Jews around the world to Israel, has been under pressure in Moscow.\n\nIn July, Russia's justice ministry accused it of violating privacy laws and said it should be shut down, triggering a diplomatic row between Israel and Russia.",

                "cc_text": "2:04 p.m. EDT\n\nMR PRICE: Good afternoon, everyone. Happy Monday. Hope everyone had a nice weekend.\n\nToday the White House announced a series of coordinated actions to respond to Nicaraguas descent under President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Rosario Murillo into a single-party authoritarian state that silences dissent, imprisons political opponents, shutters independent media and nongovernmental organizations, attacks religious leaders, and uses proceeds from the production and sale of gold to enrich regime insiders and pay off those to keep them in power. Among those actions, the Department of State is taking steps to impose visa restrictions on over 500 Nicaraguans and their family members pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 10309.\n\nThis measure suspends entry into the United States for members of the Government of Nicaragua and other persons who formulate, implement, or benefit from policies or actions that undermine democratic institutions or impede the return to democracy in Nicaragua. No member of the Nicaraguan Government nor anyone who facilitates the Ortega-Murillo regimes abuses should believe they can travel freely to the United States.\n\nToday the White House also announced an amendment to Executive Order 13851 which expands sanctions authorities, including certain trade-related measures, for Nicaragua. These new authorities support our efforts to promote accountability for the regimes accelerating actions to close all space for civil society, to increase its security cooperation with Russia, and to silence independent voices despite broad international calls for dialogue and moderation.\n\nGovernments that deny their peoples basic rights or threaten the security interests of their neighbors should not expect that their political, economic, and trade relationships with the United States will remain unaffected. Pursuant to Executive Order 13851, the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on Nicaraguan mining authority, General Directorate of Mines or DGM an office within the Ministry of Energy and Mines and on Reinaldo Gregorio Lenin Cerna Juarez, a close confidante of the Nicaraguan president.\n\nThe United States, together with our allies and partners, believes that a return to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Nicaragua is essential, and we will use the diplomatic and economic tools available to promote accountability for the Ortega-Murillo regime, to reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners, and to urge the restoration of civic space for the people of Nicaragua.\n\nOne more item before we take your questions. Last week, Russian authorities initiated a new criminal case against opposition leader and anticorruption campaigner Aleksey Navalny for allegedly, quote, \"propagating extremism, calling for terrorism, financing extremist activity, and rehabilitating Nazism.\" Those, of course, were their charges. These charges could result in a cumulative 30 years imprisonment. Only two days before the outrageous new charges were issued, an appeals court in Moscow rejected Mr. Navalnys latest appeal, and today marks 644 days since Mr. Navalny was unjustly imprisoned.\n\nThe United States is deeply concerned by the Kremlins escalation of its harassment of Mr. Navalny and continued disregard for human rights. The Russian Governments ludicrous, cynical references to Nazism fool no one outside of the echo chamber of lies it has imposed on the population of Russia through its censorship and disinformation. The United States condemns Russias continued contempt for democratic principles as demonstrated by the unjust harassment, prosecution, and imprisonment of Russian citizens who seek to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms. We once again join Mr. Navalnys family, his colleagues, and his supporters around the world in calling for his immediate and unconditional release.\n\nWith that, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. Echo chamber is an interesting expression to use as it relates to Russia.\n\nIll be really brief because I was late and I apologize. Just in terms of the comments that weve been hearing from Russian officials and the response to those comments from you guys, from the French, from the Brits and I notice that there was a call today, another one, between the Gerasimov and the British chief of staff, I guess is what you would call it, basically outlining the same things, that they think that the Ukrainians are going to or they accuse the Ukrainians of plotting to use a dirty bomb and that they will respond in kind. So without getting into what happened over the weekend and what has already been said, is there anything new that you guys have to say on this topic today?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, you asked that we not get into the weekend, but I think the weekend is important context for what were speaking to, because over the weekend you did hear and you saw a number of calls take place not only from senior officials here in Washington but from capitals in Europe. And you saw a remarkably consistent message in those readouts of those calls as well as in the joint statement that we put out last night with the forbearance of our French and British partners, who were working late early into this morning, I should say to finalize it, that made clear that were concerned when we hear this type of patently false disinformation emanating from the Kremlin. We know the Kremlins track record when it comes to these types of claims. Thats what of course what is the predicate, what ultimately undergirds our concern. We reject the transparently false allegation that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. That was a message you saw in the readouts, in the joint statement that we issued yesterday.\n\nAnd then just today, you saw from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba he put out a statement about his call with Director General Grossi of the IAEA, and Foreign Minister Kuleba said in that statement that he invited the IAEA to, quote, \"urgently send experts to peaceful facilities in Ukraine which Russia deceitfully claims to be developing a dirty bomb.\" And the IAEA has agreed. Secretary Blinken will be meeting later today with Director General Grossi of the IAEA. I imagine this will be a topic of discussion.\n\nThe broader point and again, you heard this not only from us but from our European allies as well is that the world would see through any Russian attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation. We wanted to be very clear in our calls, in our joint statements, in the readouts of those calls today, and some of which have started yesterday and that have continued today we wanted to send a very clear message that any such effort would be transparent, any such effort would not fool the world.\n\nQUESTION: Well, it wouldnt be transparent. You would see through it.\n\nMR PRICE: Correct.\n\nQUESTION: Thats the transparency.\n\nMR PRICE: Correct, correct.\n\nQUESTION: But youre not accusing the Russians of being transparent, or are you?\n\nMR PRICE: We are\n\nQUESTION: Are you saying that they are that they are telling you exactly\n\nMR PRICE: Any such deceitful attempt would be transparent transparent in its deceitfulness, I suppose. Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. And so how exactly would you respond?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, Im not going to weigh in on a hypothetical. We wanted to make very clear that any Russian attempt to establish a pretext for escalation would be nothing more than a deceitful pretext. We wanted to lay that predicate very clearly at the earliest concerning statements that we heard from senior Russian officials.\n\nHumeyra.\n\nQUESTION: Just to follow up on all of that, what evidence do you have at this moment that they might indeed be preparing for this pretext? Are you picking up any signs, any intel that they are preparing to use this as a pretext and escalate themselves?\n\nMR PRICE: Well\n\nQUESTION: With a dirty bomb or with a nuclear\n\nMR PRICE: We unfortunately are all too familiar the world is all too familiar with the Kremlins track record. This is a point that we made prior to February 24th. Its a point weve made consistently since then. And there is a track record to back that up. Obviously, in this case, we are concerned that this false allegation could be used as a pretext for further Russian escalation. And weve made that concern very clear. Weve made very clear that we reject any potential and we would reject any potential Russian effort to use a pretext to escalate this conflict. At this time, though, we havent seen any we have seen not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture, nor do we have indications that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons. But weve heard these very concerning statements, and we wanted to send a very clear signal.\n\nQUESTION: And I just wanted to ask Matts question again, because I think I dont think that its a hypothetical because youre just saying that there is elevated concern. So Jake Sullivan a few weeks ago have talked about without going into detail the kind of response that Russia would get if they if it were to deploy nuclear weapons. Would you be treating a dirty bomb attack in the same way? Would it be different? Have you communicated to allies what response you would be giving if that were the case?\n\nMR PRICE: Weve been very clear with the Russians. Weve been very clear with the world publicly with the world, privately with the Russians about the severe consequences that would result from nuclear use. Again, to Matts question, Im not going to weigh in on every conceivable hypothetical. It would certainly be another example of President Putins brutality if he were to use a so-called dirty bomb. There would be consequences for Russia whether it uses a dirty bomb or a nuclear bomb. Weve been very clear about that.\n\nQUESTION: Can I just ask you one other thing? Do you read anything into it that it has been Russian defense officials reaching out to defense counterparts, rather than the\n\nMR PRICE: We\n\nQUESTION: foreign minister, rather than diplomats? Does that mean anything to you at all?\n\nMR PRICE: Look, its not helpful, I think, for us to try to read the tea leaves.\n\nQUESTION: Im not asking you read the tea leaves.\n\nMR PRICE: Certainly not certainly not publicly. Whenever we see a leaf that is suggestive of a potential Russian pretext for further escalation, thats something of concern with concern to us, and we sought to be very clear and on the record about that concern.\n\nSaid.\n\nQUESTION: Do you have a what is a dirty bomb? Do you have a definition to a dirty bomb? Something that uses uranium, for instance? Is that it? Like depleted uranium or\n\nMR PRICE: Whether I couldnt say whether theres a technical definition.\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nMR PRICE: I think the definition that most people use is a crude radiological device.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, just so I understand correctly, youre saying that the only evidence is the fact that the Russian chief of staff, I believe, spoke with his counterpart and warned against the possible use of such a bomb by Ukraine, right? There is no other evidence?\n\nMR PRICE: Our concern is predicated on the very worrisome statements that weve heard from the Russians. And Said, it is based on those statements. But unfortunately, we have seen a pattern in this conflict, in this war, in the lead-up to this war, where the Russians have engaged in mirror-imaging. The Russians have accused the Ukrainians, the Russians have accused other countries, of what it itself was planning. That is our concern.\n\nNow, we also want to be clear about what we havent seen. We havent seen any reason for us to change our nuclear posture. We havent seen any indications that the Russians are preparing to deploy a nuclear weapon. Of course, weve heard worrisome rhetoric, troubling rhetoric from President Putin, from other senior Russian officials that pre-date these most recent statements. Its why were watching very closely and why we will adjust our posture if and when we need to.\n\nAlex.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, Ned, thanks so much. Back to Matts question on the defense line, the communication line. Its important I dont want to let this slide because today marks eight months of into this war. When the Secretary decided to call his colleague a couple of months ago, he came down here to make sure first we are aware in advance, and secondly, there is nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. What happened in the administrations policy? Why is it okay now to pick up a phone call from Shoigu, who is personally responsible for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians lives? And secondly, what happened to the administrations \"nothing without Ukraine about Ukraine\" policy?\n\nMR PRICE: That is still very much our mantra. That is still very much our policy. I think its important, Alex, to note that the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense have different responsibilities; they have different mandates. When the Secretary picked up the phone to speak with Foreign Minister Lavrov several months ago now, he did so because there were several important bilateral concerns that he thought it important to relay through his channel, which is foreign policy, which is a policy channel. In the first instance, it was our efforts to see the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner. He also was very clear about the consequences that would befall Moscow that weve now seen implemented against Moscow were it to move forward with, at the time, was the threat of annexation by force.\n\nOf course, Secretary Austin has a different set of responsibilities. I will let the Pentagon speak to his calls. They have issued a public readout. But when Secretary Austin picks up the phone to speak to secretary to Minister of Defense Shoigu, as he has done on a couple of occasions now, there are a different set of topics than Secretary Blinken would discuss with Foreign Minister Lavrov.\n\nI can assure you again, without speaking purporting to speak for Secretary Austin or the Pentagon that Secretary Austin would not engage in anything about Ukraine without Ukraine. That is a mantra that is at the heart of our approach both in this building, at the Pentagon, from the White House, and throughout this administration.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. Two questions on sanctions in Georgia. Is the U.S. State Department aware of the new list of sanctions that was assigned by Zelenskyy last week targeting the inner circle, business circle, and family members of the Georgian oligarch who, I remind you, has been controlling, orchestrating Georgian politics for the last 10 years? Have you had any consultation with Ukrainians like broadly on sanctions and lists or on concrete names on those lists?\n\nMR PRICE: We have a close working relationship with our Ukrainian partners. I would need to defer to them to speak to any sanctions that they may have issued. When it comes to Georgia youve heard us say this on a number of occasions; I think I have made this point to you previously that we remain committed to working with Georgias Government as it undertakes the reforms that have been called for by the European Union, by the European Commission in this case. We want to work with Georgia on its path and on its broader European aspirations.\n\nQUESTION: And a second question. So generally speaking, considering millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars pouring into helping Georgia become this robust, strong democracy over the last 30-plus years of the diplomatic relations, how concerned are you about the apparent drift of Georgia to towards the Russian orbit? When you look at the attacks of the U.S. ambassador in Georgia by the MPs this is something you had a statement on, I believe, in August and you had to defend your ambassador from the podium, which is unprecedented for the 30 years of diplomatic relations between two countries; and when you look at the MPs of the ruling parties who are talking about the plot by the U.S. targeting Georgia, and U.S. is trying Georgia to drag into a new war with Russia so how concerned are you when you see those events and statements by different members of the ruling party over the time?\n\nMR PRICE: Weve voiced our concern about some of the troubling statements that we have heard emanate from some corners of Georgias political system and Georgian society. Weve voiced our concern about some of the governments actions. The governments actions, including stalling or moving backward on important democratic reforms, have created setbacks. They have created setbacks to the clear, overwhelming aspirations of the people of Georgia for EU membership and for broader EU Euro-Atlantic aspiration. These actions were concerned because they have also deepened polarization within Georgian society rather than unify the country around the core issues of Euro-Atlantic integration. There has been a degree of polarization which is not helpful for the country. It is not helpful for Georgias broader political aspiration.\n\nHaving said all that, we remain committed to working with Georgia to make the reforms needed to meet its Euro-Atlantic goals. We urge Georgia to demonstrate its commitment to EU integration by adopting reforms necessary to move forward on that path.\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nQUESTION: Do you think that the situation in Georgia undermines Georgias American interest in Georgia, especially in light of this event and the war that broke out in February?\n\nMR PRICE: I missed the first part of your question.\n\nQUESTION: Do you think that the situation in Georgia and this concerns that, for instance, the former ambassadors of the U.S. to Georgia have I speak with them on a regular basis do you think the current situation in Georgia politically undermines the U.S. interest in the region? And Im talking Im asking this question in light of the war in the region.\n\nMR PRICE: Well, we think some of the actions, some of the rhetoric, has worked against the interests of the Georgian people. Thats what we care most about when it comes to Georgia and its chosen path, its chosen path of greater Euro-Atlantic integration and its EU aspirations. We want to see Georgia advance along that path. We stand ready to continue to be a partner to the Georgian people, to Georgian society, to the Georgian Government as they seek to do so.\n\nShaun.\n\nQUESTION: Can I ask you something else on Ukraine?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: President Zelenskyy today spoke at a conference virtually of Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper. And he spoke about the what he terms a Russian-Iranian alliance, and saying that Israel should do more, including supply of defensive weapons of the Iron Dome. Does the United States have anything to say about that? Does it want to weigh in on whether Israel could be doing more to help Ukraine right now?\n\nMR PRICE: Shaun, as a general matter, we dont weigh in specifically on what countries could be doing or are doing. We offer our gratitude and our appreciation for the dozens of countries around the world that are providing support to the Ukrainian people. Some of those countries are providing security assistance. Some of those countries are providing economic assistance. Some of those countries are providing humanitarian assistance. Some of those countries are providing all three, like the United States.\n\nWhen we were last in Israel in March, the Israeli our Israeli counterparts took the Secretary to the command center and they showed us a very impressive presentation of a functioning Israeli field hospital that, as I recall, had just been constructed. Israel has provided important humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine. Israel has consistently signaled that it stands on the side of the Ukrainian people and the side of the broader rules-based international order that Russia is seeking to undermine and to contravene.\n\nSo we would refer to our Israeli partners to speak specifically to the type of support they are providing, to the type of support they may consider providing.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. State Department official Gabriel Escobar had discussions in Belgrade and Pristina last week, but no results yet. Then Miroslav Lajk over the weekend continued on behalf of the EU to work on the car license plates and energy issues. My question: What are Secretary Blinkens expectations for this week? And is and what is his message to Pristina and Belgrade, given that October 31st deadline is fast approaching for the license plates?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, our message on this has been consistent. We fully support the EU-facilitated dialogue. Thats why DAS Escobar, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Gabe Escobar, was in Pristina and Belgrade to support this process. As you know, the Secretary himself has also been deeply engaged on this. He spoke with both Serbian President Vui and Kosovan Prime Minister Kurti earlier this month, on October 11th, I believe it was. He underscored our support for the EU-facilitated Kosovo-Serbia dialogue. He urged continued constructive engagement to secure peace and stability across the region.\n\nWe will continue to support that EU dialogue. We will continue to be a partner both to Kosovo and Serbia in the hope that they can resolve this dispute peacefully in the course of the coming days.\n\nSaid.\n\nQUESTION: Can I switch topics?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. On the Palestinian-Israeli issue. Ned, four days ago the Israelis began implementing a law that restricts entry into the West Bank, and I know youve been talking to the Israelis on this issue. And I want to ask you: How far along have you gotten with them? What kind of promises have the Israelis been able to give you on this issue?\n\nMR PRICE: We continue to have discussions with our Israeli counterparts on this. When weve had concerns, we voice those concerns very clearly to our Israeli counterparts. Youve heard us voice some of those concerns publicly as well. So its something we continue to discuss.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah. But in the meantime, if, lets say, someone like me wants to go, they would have to request a visa 45 days in advance and so on. Is that is that okay with you?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, Said, when weve had concerns, weve been transparent about those concerns.\n\nQUESTION: But\n\nMR PRICE: This dialogue, this is a conversation that is continuing. Obviously, Israel has important security concerns. There are also important humanitarian considerations at play here. We want to make sure that the balance of all of those interests and all of those factors is appropriate.\n\nQUESTION: But Israel does not do this to other Americans. It uses imposes this law on Palestinian Americans. So there is quite a distinction. They do have security concerns, but are you just expressing your that you are annoyed with this law, or are you are you\n\nMR PRICE: This has been a this has been\n\nQUESTION: willing to take any measures to ensure that people who carry American passport and American citizenship are treated equally?\n\nMR PRICE: This has been a longstanding conversation, and this has been going on for some time prior to the implementation of this as these rules have evolved in recent months, and even in recent days. So well continue to have this conversation when it comes to the ability of American citizens to travel, but also as it pertains to the security, the humanitarian considerations that are also at play.\n\nQUESTION: So is it likely that the Israelis might reverse this policy?\n\nMR PRICE: I wouldnt want to speak for the Israelis.\n\nYes, Alex.\n\nQUESTION: These are both Iran-related questions, two questions. Iranian drones actually, drone instructors have been spotted in Belarus over the weekend. Do you have any comment on that?\n\nAnd secondly, Iran also announced on Sunday that it can supply Russia with 40 turbines to help it with gas industry. As you know, the Russian gas industry is facing Western sanctions, so Iran is trying to help Russia out on that as well. Any comment on it?\n\nMR PRICE: When it comes to your first question, were aware of reports but we are not in a position to comment on them, that there are these Iranian trainers in Belarus. Weve noted more broadly our great concern about Iranian presence in Russian-occupied Ukraine in Crimea in particular and its actions with Russia in this regard, and were following these reports very closely.\n\nAs weve said, were continually working to ensure that the Russian Federation and the Lukashenka regime in Belarus pay a severe price, an economic toll, for Russias aggression against Ukraine. With our allies and partners, we have taken actions that target the financial networks and the assets of the Kremlins, as well as those belonging to the Lukashenka regime for enabling this Russian posture.\n\nThe Lukashenka regime, well before Russias war against Ukraine started, made a decision to cede the sovereignty of Belarus which should be, which is, a sovereign country to cede its sovereign rights to Russia to allow Russian forces to stage in Belarus, to mount a multifront attack against Ukraine. In doing so, the Lukashenka regime again put its own interests ahead of those of the people of Belarus. This has been a consistent pattern of behavior on the part of the Lukashenka regime, and we have taken action, together with allies and partners, to see to it that the regime pays a price.\n\nQUESTION: On turbine question, please?\n\nMR PRICE: Sorry. What was the turbine question?\n\nQUESTION: Turbines. Well, Iran is on Sunday announced its going to help Russian gas sector with 40 turbines. As you know, it is subject to Western sanctions.\n\nMR PRICE: Our sanctions remain fully in effect, fully in force. We will take action as appropriate if we see sanctionable activity, whether thats on the part of Iran, whether thats on the part of Russia.\n\nQUESTION: One more Iranian, if I may. Iranian Revolutionary Guard held military exercises on border with Azerbaijan last week, which triggered some concerns in Azerbaijan. Any comment on that, please?\n\nMR PRICE: I dont have a particular comment on that. Of course we want to see and weve we have made clear our interest in seeing a stable Caucasus region, a region that where we work both with Armenia and Azerbaijan to de-escalate tensions between those two countries and to work to de-escalate any broader tensions that may arise.\n\nGuita.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. Special Envoy Rob Malleys tweet over the weekend has angered Iranian activists about the it was about the demonstrations, where he said that the demonstrators want their government to respect their dignity and human rights.\n\nWhen the State Department looks at these videos out of Iran as well as those demonstrations held across the world, what do you see these people asking for? Because, okay, it all started yes, we want more freedom but then it has evolved. It has changed into chants of \"Death to dictator, death to the Islamic Republic.\" Theyre asking for regime change. What does the State Department see in these videos?\n\nMR PRICE: Its not for us to interpret what the people of Iran are asking for. It is up to them to be very clear with their voice, with their own government and with the world, to state what they are asking for.\n\nIt is up to us and what we have done is to provide the Iranian people with some of the tools that can help their voice be heard. The Iranian people by peacefully taking to the streets, by making these demands, we have sought to lend them and to certainly not stand in the way of services, the provision of hardware, of software that will allow their voices to be heard both within Iran, between Iranian citizens inside Iran, and to allow their voices to be heard outside of Iran. It is important that the world listen to the people of Iran.\n\nWe would never intend to characterize what it is that they seek. That is for the Iranian people to define and to express themselves.\n\nQUESTION: Well, they are saying that they want regime change, they dont want the Islamic Republic anymore. But just the fact that the tweet says, \"their government.\" They dont consider the Islamic Republic their government.\n\nMR PRICE: And Rob has spoken to this. He would never intend to speak for or on behalf of the people of Iran. It is up to the Iranian people to be clear about their aspirations, and we are hearing those aspirations every day. We want to continue, we will continue to do everything we can to see to it that their voices are heard both inside Iran and well beyond as well. After all, they are expressing and exercising rights that are as universal to them as they are to anyone else.\n\nRob Malley is a tremendous public servant. He is someone who has led our approach to this set of challenges. He is someone who has been at the forefront as we have developed new tools like General License D-2 that we announced last month. He has been at the forefront as we have developed accountability measures to impose on senior Iranian officials and entities, including the so-called \"morality police;\" including on those who are responsible for the bloodshed, for the repression; including on those who have sought to silence the voices of the Iranian people. We are going to continue to look for what to examine what more we can do to support the Iranian people as they seek to have their voices heard and respected.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, I think the point is, though, that you dont have to interpret what theyre saying. What is it that you see that theyre calling for? Do you think that theyre calling for something thats less than regime change?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, I am not going to speak on behalf of the Iranian people. They are doing that they are doing that\n\nQUESTION: Well, you have a senior official who did just that over the weekend.\n\nMR PRICE: They are doing that very ably, and its our charge to provide them with the tools, to see to it that the tools that can help lift those voices; to see to it that the world can hear their voices, that those tools can reach them.\n\nQUESTION: Well, what do you think that theyre protesting what do you think theyre protesting about?\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, there often are proximate causes when it comes to protests. I think it is clear that the proximate cause over the course of the past year has been any number of things: water shortages, mismanagement, the death of Mahsa Amini. And since then, of course, weve seen these protests take on a much larger scale and in some ways a much broader meaning and significance. But its not for me to either interpret or to speak on behalf of the people of Iran. It is our charge to see to it that they can speak on behalf of themselves, to see to it that the rest of the world can hear the important messages that they have to say.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, what is it the message what is the message that you hear from these protests, then?\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, I am the spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State. I am not the spokesperson for protesters in Iran. So we will leave it to them to voice their aspirations.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, lets say that if I walk down the street carrying a sign saying oranges are bad, okay orange, the fruit oranges are bad; they should be banned what would you say that my message is?\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, I would say Im the\n\nQUESTION: Is that up for you to interpret?\n\nMR PRICE: Im the spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State. I am not the spokesperson for oranges.\n\nYes, go ahead. (Laughter.) Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Jahanzaib Ali from ARY News TV, Pakistan. Senior Pakistani journalist, and my colleague, my friend, Arshad Sharif was killed in Nairobi. I think can I just .\n\nQUESTION: Sorry.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. No, its all right. So a senior journalist, my colleague, my friend, Arshad Sharif was killed in Nairobi, and he was forced to live in exile due to his investigative reporting about the specific political system of Pakistan. Sir, we often talk about this. What is your message to the Pakistani leadership to fulfill their commitments regarding press freedom?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, first, I express my condolences to you. I express my condolences to Arshads colleagues, to his loved ones, to family members, to all those who knew him, who knew his work. Were deeply saddened by the death of Arshad Sharif. We encourage a full investigation by the Government of Kenya into his death. Its not entirely clear that we know all the circumstances at this point regarding what led to his death, but we do urge a full investigation.\n\nQUESTION: Sir, Arshad Sharif called me the day before yesterday. I was talking to him on the phone, and he told me that he applied to renew his U.S. visa from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, but it was rejected. So, sir, is there any kind of special kind of thing that you like have those kind of journalists or people who just, like, facing death threats and apply for the visa? I mean, just came into my mind, this question. I was talking to him the day before yesterday, and I was trying to help him.\n\nMR PRICE: Its difficult for me to speak with any specificity regarding what we could do with a particular individual, but we have programs around the world in the first instance to bolster protections for those who are exercising what is another universal right, the right to freedom of expression, the right to information. And its clear through his work that Arshad Sharif was dedicated to that fundamental right of freedom of expression took him around the world. His work was known around the world.\n\nUSAID has a number of programs to work with governments around the world to bolster those rights, to bolster independent media. We have taken action. The department and others have taken action when we are aware of efforts on the part of governments around the world to intimidate, to harass, to otherwise seek to silence the voices of those who are so committed to that freedom of expression.\n\nQUESTION: Sir, there are many Pakistani journalists who are living in exile due to this kind of threats. To be honest, I feel 100 percent safe here in Washington, D.C., but just wanted to hear from you the journalists who are a little critical about Pakistani political system, should we should they all feel safe here in United States of America?\n\nMR PRICE: This is a country that cherishes the rights that are enshrined in our Constitution, in our Bill of Rights. I, of course, am not here to offer advice to everyone, but these are rights that are embedded in our countrys experience, that are embedded in Americas DNA. We also believe that these rights are universal. These are rights that should not be only protected here. These are rights that should be at the heart of societies around the world. And when countries fail to respect these rights, when they actively try to contravene these rights in this case, when they attempt to suppress, repress, or otherwise harass journalists they tend to hear about it from the United States. And thats a good thing.\n\nYeah.\n\nQUESTION: Just may I ask one more on Pakistan, since were on the topic?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Does the United States have anything to say about the decision to bar Imran Khan from standing for election for five years?\n\nMR PRICE: We are not going to inject ourselves into internal Pakistani politics or into a dispute between the court and the Pakistani political system.\n\nYes. Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Can I ask something completely different?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: If you dont Haiti. Just wanted I know youve addressed this in recent days and the Secretary addressed it on Friday, but or the French foreign minister. With the can you say where things stand now on having an international force for Haiti? Is there a partner country? Does the United States still find this to be an urgent priority?\n\nMR PRICE: We do still find it to be an urgent priority. We, along with Haitian leaders, along with OAS leadership, along with many of our partners and allies around the world, do see the status quo as unsustainable given the security situation, the public health situation, the economic situation that Haitians are confronting. We believe the Haitian people must find a way to achieve an inclusive, broad-based, consistent broad-based consensus on the way forward for their countrys government and development, and, of course, there have been discrete actors who have sought to stand in the way. We strongly condemn acts of violence that occurred in Haiti over the past weeks and those malign actors who continue to block the distribution of food and fuel to Haitian businesses and other essential Haitian institutions.\n\nWe are encouraging actions that will lead to the conditions for elections to take place as soon as possible. As you know, just last week, on October 21st, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted the sanctions resolution that we put forth together with our Mexican partners to hold some of these malign actors accountable, and by taking this step, weve taken we have helped to stymie the activities of criminal actors in Haiti. And after robust and inclusive negotiations, this resolution is truly reflective of the council consensus.\n\nAs you know, were continuing to work with our partners to determine the next steps. We have in the meantime provided Haitian officials with vital security-related equipment. We did so earlier this month on October 15th, when the United States and Canada together provided security-related equipment to Port-au-Prince flown in by military aircraft. This equipment was purchased by the Haitian Government for their fight against criminal gangs.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned.\n\nQUESTION: Ned.\n\nMR PRICE: Ill come back to you.\n\nHumeyra.\n\nQUESTION: Just on Brittney Griner, because she has her appeal hearing tomorrow. So I think its been about three months since U.S. has put forward the substantial proposal. There hasnt been any developments. Can you give us an update where those talks are? Is there any reason to be hopeful?\n\nMR PRICE: The only element I can offer in terms of an update is that these discussions have been ongoing. You are correct that we put forward a substantial proposal a number of months ago now. We have consistently urged our Russian counterparts to act on this proposal. The fact that Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan remain in detention, the fact that Brittney Griner last week celebrated her 32nd birthday in detention, the fact that Paul Whelan has spent years in detention is a sign that these discussions have not gotten the point gotten to the point where we would like them to be, because we would like to see Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner home. We would like to see them reunited with their families.\n\nQUESTION: And when you see that the when you say the discussions are still ongoing, do you mean there are active discussions when you guys are basically negotiating on what kind of a deal can be formulated, or just that the communication channel is open but its just basically not moving?\n\nMR PRICE: I can say there have been active discussions, including in recent days, but our imperative is to see Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner returned home. We are not going to do anything, to say anything publicly that could impair that ability. These conversations we know from past experience, including in the case of Trevor Reed, are best conducted privately in the appropriate channels.\n\nYes. A follow-up? Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: Brittney Griners lawyer said today that shes hoping that they reduce her nineyear prison sentence tomorrow as part of the appeal conclusion. Is that also what the U.S. Government is hoping for, or what are you hoping to see tomorrow?\n\nMR PRICE: What were hoping to see and what we are working to see is the return of Brittney Griner to her loving wife, the return of Paul Whelan to his loving family. That is what we are working to achieve.\n\nWe have not weighed in on the various judicial proceedings and judicial steps because, as weve made clear, we believe that these proceedings have been largely shambolic. This has been an effort to detain wrongfully an American citizen two American citizens in the case of Paul Whelan, of Brittney Griner. Wrongful detainees are by definition wrongfully held. They are used for as political pawns, as leverage. It is our goal to see them home as soon as we can.\n\nQUESTION: And can I just one question on Russia really quickly? Theres a group of I think 30 liberal Democrats who wrote a letter to Biden today, and they are citing the need for a proactive diplomatic push and redoubling efforts to create a framework for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Is the Biden administration doing that, or will you do that?\n\nMR PRICE: Nobody wants to see this war ended more than our Ukrainian partners. Our Ukrainian partners have similarly said that this war will only end through diplomacy and dialogue. We know what that end game will entail; we dont know when it will transpire. And we dont know when it will transpire principally and solely because we have not seen any indication from the Russians that they are prepared to engage in that diplomacy and dialogue. If and when that happens and just as our Ukrainian partners are convinced it will happen, we are convinced it will happen we will be standing by the side of Ukraine; we will be supporting their diplomatic efforts.\n\nBut in the first instance, this is going to be diplomacy that our Ukrainian partners are going to have to lead. They are going to have to determine the contours of this diplomacy, what any negotiation will look like. In the interim, of course, we havent been sitting on our hands. We have been providing our Ukrainian partners with what they need on the battlefield so that when the negotiating table emerges, they will be in the strongest possible position. That is the most important thing we can do now: to provide them with support to strengthen their hand on the battlefield, ultimately to make their hand stronger at the negotiating table, as we continue to impose costs and consequences on the Russians.\n\nQUESTION: So you would\n\nQUESTION: May I follow on Ukraine?\n\nQUESTION: So you would say that the Biden administration is proactively pushing for diplomacy, or that you guys are holding off on that proactive push because you dont think itll be effective?\n\nMR PRICE: In order for diplomacy to take place, there have to be parties ready and willing to engage in diplomacy. Right now, we have heard from our Ukrainian partners repeatedly that this war will only end through diplomacy and dialogue. We have not heard any reciprocal statement or refrain from Moscow that they are ready in good faith to engage in that diplomacy and dialogue.\n\nYes, sir. Ive yes.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Thank you, Ned, for giving me the chance. My name is Mesfin from TG Ethiopia, and my question is about Ethiopia. Heres my first question, then. Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians gathered Saturday in Addis Ababa and other cities in Ethiopia to demand that the United States and other European countries stop their interference and pressure in Ethiopias internal affairs. Some demonstrators even displayed banners accusing the United States of disrespecting Ethiopias sovereignty. What is the State Departments response to the demonstrators demands?\n\nMR PRICE: Im sorry, I missed the first part of your question in terms of the demonstrators demands.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, they are accusing the United States disrespecting Ethiopias sovereignty. They are saying that the United States is interfering in Ethiopias internal affairs. So what is your response to that?\n\nMR PRICE: Our response, of course, is that those claims are wholly inaccurate, they are wholly wrong. The interest of the United States is the interest of the Ethiopian people: to see the restoration of peace, to see an end to the violence, to see a sovereign, whole Ethiopia. And thats why weve supported the African Union-led talks.\n\nAnd tomorrow in fact, these African Union-led talks will kick off in South Africa to address the ongoing conflict in northern Ethiopia that has cost so many lives, has led to atrocities, has led to bloodshed, has led to starvation, has aggravated so many underlying factors. We commend South Africa for hosting the talks. We stand ready to support the African Union High Representative Obasanjo and the AU panel members, former South African Deputy Prime Minister[1] Mlambo-Ngcuka, and former Kenyan President Kenyatta in facilitating an agreement.\n\nAnd to that end, our Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Mike Hammer is in South Africa to observe and to participate in the AU-led talks along with United Nations and IGAD, and to support efforts to have an immediate cessation of hostilities, to deliver humanitarian assistance to all Ethiopians in need, to prevent further human rights abuses and atrocity atrocities, and to secure Eritreas withdrawal from northern Ethiopia. Those are our interests, but importantly, those are also the interests of the Ethiopian people.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, yesterday also Ethiopians and Eritreans demonstrated in front of the White House asking the same question. Did you get their messages?\n\nMR PRICE: We have heard loud and clear messages from Ethiopians around the world, first in the first instance, in Ethiopia. Our special envoy has spent significant time in Addis in recent weeks meeting with a range of stakeholders. Of course there are vibrant Ethiopian diaspora communities around the world, including here in the United States. Were engaging with appropriate stakeholders to determine how best we can help the people of Ethiopia achieve their aspirations to end the violence, to provide humanitarian assistance, to restore Ethiopias sovereignty, and to put an end to the atrocities and human rights abuses.\n\nQUESTION: And final question, Ned.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, can we move to China?\n\nQUESTION: Final question.\n\nMR PRICE: Final question.\n\nQUESTION: The Ethiopian military is advancing in Tigray regions and today also announced that the Ethiopian military occupied some of the Tigrayans capital. What is your thought on this?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, weve been clear since the resumption of fighting: the fighting must stop. Peace must be given a chance through these talks, these talks that are set to begin tomorrow in South Africa. We call on the Government of Ethiopia and Tigrayan authorities to engage seriously in these talks to achieve an immediate cessation of hostilities, the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all Ethiopians in need, to prevent further human rights abuses and atrocities, and to effect Eritreas withdrawal from northern Ethiopia.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, Ned. On China, do you have does the U.S. have a has an assessment on the outcome of Chinas 20th Party Congress, and does the outcome in any way, shape, or form change the U.S. calculation in dealing with the Peoples Republic of China (inaudible) and if you could share with us any U.S. intelligence on the former President Hu Jintao being escorted out, apparently non-voluntarily? Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Of course the conclusion of the party conference doesnt change our approach. Youve heard our approach articulated most clearly and most at length by Secretary Blinken in May when he outlined our approach to the PRC. We do note the conclusion of the 20th Party Congress and we would welcome cooperation of the PRC where our interests align, and that includes cooperation on climate change, on global health, counternarcotics, nonproliferation as well.\n\nAt the same time, the administration has been clear that were focused on responsibly managing the competition with the PRC. This is perhaps the most consequential bilateral relationship we have. Well continue our efforts to keep lines of communication open, including at the leader level. We think it is incumbent on the United States to do that. Its why Secretary Blinken has not hesitated to meet with Wang Yi, others have not hesitated to meet with, to speak with, their PRC counterparts, and well continue to keep those lines of communication open.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Any take on the Hu Jintao being escorted out? Will you be able to\n\nMR PRICE: I dont have any comment or assessment to offer.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: And you mentioned that the Secretary in May the speech in May. Do you have anything on the status of China House? Is it up and running or is there a timeline?\n\nMR PRICE: This is something that were continuing to discuss with members of Congress. We know that our approach to the PRC will be most effective when we have buy-in from congressional overseers, congressional appropriators, congressional authorizers. These are conversations that are ongoing, but we look forward to launching China House at the first possible opportunity, knowing that if we are to compete effectively against or with the PRC we need to be able to pull on all of the resources that are within and under this roof. And that is the point of China House, to integrate the resources that we have here at the State Department and to ensure that in turn we can integrate them with what the White House is doing, what our partners in the interagency are doing as well.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: You and colleagues have described this as a period of provocation with North Koreas activity and tensions between the North and the South. Now that the PRCs national congress is over and were a few days ahead of the U.S. midterms, is there any reason to be more concerned now about North Korea trying anything with a nuclear test than before this current period?\n\nMR PRICE: Our concern regarding the potential for another North Korean nuclear test, which would be its seventh, has been consistent for some time now. We assess that the DPRK is preparing its Punggye-ri test site for what would be its seventh test. This is consistent with the DPRKs own public statements. This is something weve said for a number of months now.\n\nWe are preparing for all contingencies in close coordination with our partners and allies around the world. As you know, Deputy Secretary Sherman is in Japan. Much of her visit in Japan will be dedicated to discussing the challenge that the DPRK poses to the region. Shell do that bilaterally with her Japanese and South Korean counterparts. Shell also do it trilaterally, recognizing the importance of trilateral cooperation on this challenge.\n\nWere prepared to make both short and longer-term adjustments to our military posture as appropriate in responding to DPRK provocation and, as necessary, to strengthen both defense and deterrence to protect our allies in the region.\n\nWe have made consistently clear that we harbor no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We remain open to dialogue. We remain open to diplomacy. We recognize that diplomacy and dialogue remains the most effective path by which to achieve our overarching goal, and thats the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. At the same time, our commitment to the security of our personnel in the region, of our treaty allies, is ironclad, it is sacrosanct, and well discuss that in forthcoming engagements.\n\nYes. Janne.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. You know that the North Korea invaded Northern Limit Line, NLL, early this morning. Also, regarding former National Security Advisor Bolton recently said that United States cannot give up North Korea to nuclear weapons through diplomacy and sanctions; therefore, as another option, he said that the North Koreans regime should be changed. What is the Biden administration doing to change the North Korean Kim Jong-uns regime? Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Those are the words of private citizen; they should be treated as such. We have made very clear that the policy of this administration that, by the way, has been similar to the policies of previous administrations is that diplomacy and dialogue represents the most effective means by which to address the challenge that North Korea poses. That is why we remain, as I just said a moment ago, open to dialogue and diplomacy. We harbor no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We seek to have practical conversations on fulfilling what is that core and overarching goal: the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: One more quick one. North Korea mocks South Korea for being rejected by the United States to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea. How you can analyze this?\n\nMR PRICE: Our commitment to the security of our allies, including the ROK, including Japan is ironclad. That commitment is sacrosanct. As you know, we recently resumed the extended deterrence working group. We are committed to extended deterrence for our allies Japan and South Korea.\n\nQUESTION: Ned\n\nMR PRICE: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: So you took issue with Tahrir al-Sham being in control of Afrin in Syria. Now theyre supposedly withdrawn from the city, but some reports indicate including some reports from conflict monetary organizations and claim that they havent really withdrawn from the city. Its just theyve switched their flags from their flag to some other groups. Whats your current understanding of the Tahrir al-Shams control of Afrin?\n\nMR PRICE: Im not in a position to offer a more updated assessment beyond what weve said (inaudible). Its something we monitor very closely, but I just dont have an updated assessment to offer today.\n\nQUESTION: Apart from just calling for them to leave the city, did you have any other tools to get them out of the city?\n\nMR PRICE: This is something that weve been focused on with partners in the region. Of course, instability in Syria, the ability of extremist groups, of terrorist groups to use Syrian territory to form a base, to plot, that is of concern to all of us. We have a range of tools and well continue to calibrate those tools appropriately.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Oh, thank you, Ned. One short clarification on Ukraine. Could you clarify the administration position about the possibility of the American troops being physically being present at or settled on the Ukrainian territory? Why I got this question? This Saturday CBS News made a reportage from Romania, and they spoke with the leadership of the U.S. Army 101 Airborne, and American military told them that Im quoting they are fully prepared to cross the border into Ukraine. And I got my audience in Ukraine and people are curious: is it any shift in a new U.S. administration position, or may one consider this as a signal to Moscow?\n\nMR PRICE: There has been no shift in the administrations position. Our position has been clear. Were going to do everything we can to stand with Ukraine, to stand for the rules-based international order that Russia is attempting to undermine and to contravene. We are doing that through the provision of security assistance. We are doing that by holding the Kremlin and its key decision leaders to account with sanctions, other economic and financial measures. But the President has been clear we are not going to get into certainly not going to seek to get into a war with Russia. What we are doing is providing Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against what is clearly Russian aggression.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. The Mexican Government has confirmed it has purchased several units of scanning equipment from a company with strong links to the Chinese government. We learned from Washington Post reporting this weekend that the Biden administration considered this purchase a national security threat, and that even Ambassador Salazar sent a letter to the Mexican Foreign Ministry suggesting not to purchase this equipment. Mexico didnt stop and continues to buy this scanning equipment that will be placed in places like Tijuana for goods going into the U.S. What does it say when your Mexican partners disregard the U.S. concerns on this issue?\n\nMR PRICE: I dont think its fair to say that shared concerns have been disregarded. I we can let you know if we have any specific comments on these procurement decisions, but we typically dont comment on specific procurement decisions, but we do have a robust dialogue with our Mexican counterparts, including when it comes to border security issues. During the High-Level Security Dialogue that Secretary Blinken, Secretary Mayorkas, and Attorney General Garland took part in last month, there was a discussion of irregular migration, there was a discussion of the need to manage these challenges both in the region and closer to the border. Those are discussions that were continuing to have with our Mexican counterparts, and if we have anything to offer on a procurement decision, well let you know.\n\nQUESTION: But specifically on that, are you challenging the Washington Post reporting about Mexico purchasing these Chinese-linked technologies?\n\nMR PRICE: Im just not weighing in on a particular procurement decision.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Well, wait, wait a second. But you weigh in procurement decisions all the time. I mean, ask Turkey. Lets ask Europe when\n\nMR PRICE: I said\n\nQUESTION: When European countries are going around talking about Huawei and 5G and you guys are saying \"No, no, no.\" You weigh in on\n\nMR PRICE: And I said Im not weighing in on this particular procurement decision.\n\nQUESTION: Oh, this particular one? So its only when you feel like it.\n\nMR PRICE: Well let you know if we have anything to say on this one.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, back on China. The Department of Justice announced about an hour ago, give or take, that theyre charging several members of the Chinese Communist Party, the security apparatus there, with interfering in various affairs here in the U.S. Obviously, the DOJ is going to handle the criminal prosecutions, but when it comes to the Department of State, how are you guys going to respond to this threat and deal with it going forward? Some of the things they mentioned are things that have been going on for a while. Some of these people allegedly set up a fake think tank to try to influence American institutions. They tried to recruit former law enforcement, professors. These things have been happening for quite some time; theres been a lot of reporting about it. The DOJ, like I said, will do the criminal prosecution, but what are you guys doing to try to rein in this problem that seems to be still very pervasive?\n\nMR PRICE: I only saw these reports as I was walking out, and in any case we wouldnt comment on charges that have been unsealed by the Department of Justice. But more broadly, leaving aside what the Department of Justice alleged in a charging document today, what I can say is that this is a relationship that is multifaceted. We seek to cooperate with the PRC when it is in Americas national interests to do so. But this is a relationship that is primarily predicated on competition. And we are doing everything we can to compete and ultimately to out-compete with the PRC across the board. There are also elements of this relationship that are adversarial. And again, without speaking to any details that DOJ may have made public today, this certainly would seem to be in the category of adversarial elements of this relationship. Were clear-eyed about the multifaceted nature of this relationship. We are prepared for the competition, we are prepared to defend our interests when they are challenged by the PRC.\n\nLet me go to yes, I dont think youve had a question.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah. So on Russia, Ned, you have been talking about severe consequences for a long time. You have already conveyed them to Russians. Why dont you convey to the world as well whats going to be the result? Is there going to be consequences? Is it going to be military, or economic and political?\n\nMR PRICE: We think its important that the Russians know the profound nature of the consequences that would befall their country should they engage in nuclear use. At the same time, this is these are conversations that these are the types of conversations where we can be more pointed in private. We can convey very frank and sharp messages when we need to. And weve been also clear publicly that there will be profound consequences, but its not something that weve chosen to detail publicly.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Another question. Just on al-Hol camp, there is a report that the administration has enacted a plan to reduce the population at al-Hol camp in Syria, and six European countries and Australia has agreed to transfer some of their nationals back to their countries. Do you have anything on that\n\nMR PRICE: We welcome the efforts of our partners around the world, including our European partners, to repatriate their nationals. We think that it is the right and important thing to do, and its something we continue to discuss with them.\n\nElizabeth.\n\nQUESTION: Irans foreign minister said over the weekend that they had received a message indicating the U.S. was in a hurry to reach a nuclear agreement. Do you have any response to that, and has there been any indirect communication recently?\n\nMR PRICE: Of course there has been no such message to Iran. Those reports are not at all accurate. Our only message would be a simple one: stop killing your people. Stop sending weapons to Russia to kill Ukrainians. These are the same messages that we have conveyed publicly that we would convey privately.\n\nThank you all very much.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\n(The briefing was concluded at 3:09 p.m.)",

Three people were hospitalized with injuries, he said, adding that 354 homes were without electricity and many others were without natural gas.\n\nThe Aquarium Museum in Sevastopol reported the storm tore through the complex, killing all of the estimated 800 animals housed in the facility.\n\nOne death has been reported by officials in Crimea, where a storm warning remained in effect on November 27. Another death was reported on Telegram channels but not confirmed.\n\nIn war-wracked Ukraine, inclement weather adds to people's hardships caused by Russian strikes on the country's energy infrastructure.\n\nHeavy snowfall across the country prompted the closure of 14 highways, while 16 of Ukraine's 24 regions were experiencing power cuts. Especially harsh conditions were reported in the southern regions of Odesa and Mykolayiv, where snow drifts as high as 2 meters hampered traffic. Seventy-one accidents, nine with injuries, were reported in Odesa and the Odesa region.\n\nThe Ukrainian Interior Ministry said a total of 2,019 settlements in 16 regions have been left without electricity, while 1,370 trucks remain stranded, and 840 cars had to be towed.\n\nIn the Russian-occupied part of the Kherson region, 94 settlements were without electricity, said Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the region. The wind knocked down nine power lines and damaged more than 50 towers, and communications and Internet have been disrupted.\n\nAuthorities in Romania and neighboring Moldova said hundreds of cities and villages have been left without electricity and water in the two countries following heavy snowfall and blizzards that prompted severe disruption of road and railway traffic.\n\nRailway traffic has resumed in southeastern Romania, but 21 national highways remained closed as of November 27, authorities said, while schools in five southeastern counties -- Braila, Galati, Tulcea, Calarasi, and Constanta -- were also closed.\n\nA total of 22 counties out of 41 and 170 villages and cities in the southeast of the country, including Bucharest, were affected by power cuts.\n\nIn Moldova, 123,000 people from almost 200 localities were left without electricity. One man died when his car veered off the snow-covered road and hit a tree on November 26, police said, adding that several other traffic accidents had been reported.\n\nSixteen Moldovans were injured when their bus was overturned by the blizzard on a highway in southern Romania, police said. Emergency services transported several injured people to the hospital.\n\nIn Bulgaria, snowfall and blizzards prompted authorities to declare a state of emergency in several areas in the northeast of the Balkan country -- Silistra and Razgrad regions, Valchi dol municipality, Varna region, and Shumen region. Some 1,000 settlements were without electricity, Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said at an emergency government meeting on November 26.\n\nWith reporting by RFE/RL's Russian Service, Digi24.ro, hotnews.ro, unimedia.md, AP, and Reuters",

Tehran denies supplying the drones.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv was certain they were Iranian and would be ready to share a \"bag of evidence\" to European powers in doubt.\n\n\"Tehran bears full responsibility for the destruction of relations with Ukraine\", Kuleba told a news conference. \"I am submitting to the president of Ukraine a proposition to sever diplomatic ties with Iran.\"\n\nKuleba said he had urged the European Union to impose sanctions on Iran \"for helping Russia to kill Ukrainians.\"\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba attends a high level meeting of the United Nations Security Council on the situation amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, at the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N.

All times EDT.\n\n10:28 p.m.:\n\n9:22 p.m.: Ukraine's state energy company responded to Saturdays missile strikes by Russia on key energy infrastructure sites by announcing that rolling blackouts would be imposed in Kyiv and 10 Ukrainian regions in order to stabilize the situation, The Associated Press reported.\n\nIn a Facebook post Saturday, Ukrenergo accused Russia of attacking \"energy facilities within the principal networks of the western regions of Ukraine.\" It claimed that the scale of destruction has been comparable to the fallout from Moscow's first coordinated attack on the Ukrainian energy grid, Oct. 10-12.\n\nBoth Ukrenergo and officials in Kyiv have been urging Ukrainians to conserve energy.\n\nEarlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on consumers to curb their power use between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. daily and avoid using energy-guzzling appliances such as electric heaters.\n\nOver the past two weeks, Moscow has increased its attacks on key civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. Officials said about 40% of the country's electric power system has been severely damaged.\n\n8:10 p.m.: The Ukrainian presidential office said in its Saturday statement that five explosive-laden drones were downed in the central Cherkasy region southeast of Kyiv, according to The Associated Press.\n\nUkraine's top diplomat said Saturday's attacks were proof that Ukraine needed new Western-reinforced air defense systems \"without a minute of delay.\"\n\n\"Air defense saves lives,\" Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office, said on Telegram Saturday that almost 1.4 million households lost power as a result of the strikes. He said some 672,000 homes in the western Khmelnytskyi region were affected, while a further 242,000 suffered outages in the central Cherkasy province.\n\n7:13 p.m.: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says the use of a nuclear weapon by Russia in the war in Ukraine would be considered an \"act of hostility against humanity,\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.\n\n\"Russia's act of threatening the use of nuclear weapons is a serious threat to the peace and security of the international community and absolutely unacceptable,\" Kishida said Saturday during a visit to Australia.\n\nIn May next year, Kishida is expected to host leaders from the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Hiroshima, where a U.S. nuclear bomb was dropped August 6, 1945, resulting in the deaths of 140,000 people.\n\nThe Japanese city of Nagasaki was hit three days later.\n\nJapan remains the only country to have ever been hit with a nuclear bomb.\n\nKishida said the 77-year period of no nuclear weapons use \"must not be ended.\"\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February, President Putin has made several thinly veiled threats about his willingness to deploy tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n6:19 p.m.: The newborn peeking out of a pink blanket in a hospital on the north bank of Ukraine's Dnieper River may never see her grandparents back home in the Russian-occupied south, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\nHer mother fled for the relative safety of government-held Zaporizhzhia to make sure the baby was born a citizen of the country the Russians invaded eight months ago.\n\nBut her grandparents stayed behind and out of reach on the opposite side of the shore.\n\n\"It may be too late for them to get out,\" 19-year-old Anastasia Skachko lamented while stealing glances at her still-nameless girl. \"I don't even want them to try. The roads are all either mined or getting shelled.\"\n\n5:27 p.m.: Spain said Saturday that it would send 14 fighter jets to Bulgaria and Romania to bolster NATO's eastern flank, Agence Frace-Presse reported, as the defense alliance strengthens its deterrence capacity following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMadrid will send six Eurofighter jets and 130 soldiers to Bulgaria between mid-November and early December to train local forces, the Spanish defense ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt added that a further deployment will see eight F18M fighter jets and 130 air force personnel sent to Romania between December and March 2023 as part of NATO's \"reaction and deterrence\" strategy.\n\nA long-range aerial surveillance radar has also been deployed in Romania since October 17 and could remain until late June 2023, the statement said.\n\n4:11 p.m.: In Romania, protesters blew horns and banged drums to voice their dismay over the rising cost of living. People across France took to the streets to demand pay increases that keep pace with inflation. Czech demonstrators rallied against government handling of the energy crisis. British railway staff and German pilots held strikes to push for better pay as prices rise.\n\nAcross Europe, soaring inflation is behind a wave of protests and strikes that underscores growing discontent with the spiraling cost of living and threatens to unleash political turmoil, The Associated Press reports.\n\nEuropeans have seen their energy bills and food prices soar because of Russias war in Ukraine. The fallout from the war has sharply raised the risk of civil unrest in Europe, according to risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.\n\nEuropean leaders have strongly supported Ukraine, sending the country weapons and pledging or being forced to wean their economies off cheap Russian oil and natural gas, but the transition hasnt been easy and threatens to erode public support.\n\n\"Theres no quick fix to the energy crisis,\" said Torbjorn Soltvedt, an analyst at Verisk Maplecroft. \"And if anything, inflation looks like it might be worse next year than it has been this year.\"\n\n3:17 p.m.: Ukrainian forces are using Soviet-era T-64B tanks to defend the area around the key city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Russian troops have been making slow but steady progress in the area. RFE/RL's Maryan Kushnir followed a tank crew from Ukraine's 30th Mechanized Brigade as it targeted Russian logistical supplies like fuel and ammunition. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report:\n\n2:23 p.m.: Iran has criticized a call by France, Germany, and Britain for the United Nations to investigate accusations that Russia has used Iranian-made drones to attack Ukraine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said October 22 the initiative announced the previous day by the so-called E-3 group of countries was \"false and baseless\" and that it was \"strongly rejected and condemned.\"\n\nUkraine says Russia has struck its infrastructure with Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones that cruise toward their target and explode on impact.\n\nBoth Iran and Russia have denied the accusations.\n\nIn a letter signed by their U.N. envoys and seen by Reuters, the three European countries backed Ukraine's call October 17 for a U.N. probe, arguing that the drone use breached a U.N. Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 2231 endorsing the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers.\n\n1:18 p.m.: Many Ukrainians risk their lives to save pets and domestic animals.\n\nDogs, cats, and even goats have been evacuated from combat zones in Ukraine, including a dog called Crimea that was the sole survivor of a Russian missile attack on a family home in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n12:08 p.m.: Pro-Russian authorities in Ukraine's southern Kherson region, which Moscow claims to have annexed, Saturday urged residents of the region's eponymous main city to leave \"immediately\" in the face of Kyiv's advancing counter-offensive, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\n\"Due to the tense situation on the front, the increased danger of mass shelling of the city and the threat of terrorist attacks, all civilians must immediately leave the city and cross to the left bank of the Dnieper river,\" the region's pro-Russian authorities said on social media.\n\n11:12 a.m.:\n\n10:13 a.m.: Finnish officials will arrive in Ankara on Tuesday to discuss their countrys bid to join NATO, Turkeys state-run news agency reported Saturday, according to The Associated Press.\n\nA delegation from Finlands Justice Ministry will meet Kasim Cicek, the head of foreign relations at the Turkish Ministry of Justice, Anadolu Agency said. The talks will focus on the extradition of individuals Turkey regards as terrorists, the report added.\n\nBoth Finland and its neighbor Sweden applied for membership in the defense alliance in the wake of Russias February invasion of Ukraine, abandoning long-standing policies of military nonalignment. Becoming a NATO member requires the unanimous support of all current members, including Turkey.\n\nTurkey has threatened to block the process unless Finland and Sweden meet its demands. In particular, Ankara wants them to crack down on people it considers terrorists, such as supporters of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, and members of a group said to have orchestrated a failed coup in 2016.\n\n9:16 a.m.: In late June 2019, a Russian man named Yury Orekhov met in a European hotel with a businessman representing a California-based company involved in consulting and logistics. Orekhov, the co-owner of a German industrial equipment and commodities trading company, told the businessman that he wanted to buy U.S. components to be used in a Russian Sukhoi fighter jet.\n\nAccording to a U.S. federal indictment unsealed this week, Orekhov allegedly told the unnamed businessman that the paperwork would have to be falsified to show a fake Malaysian company was the purchaser, in order avoid U.S. export restrictions, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.\n\nNot long after, a Russian woman who worked for Orekhov followed up with the businessman, requesting help to buy sensitive military technologies including \"tactical air navigation interrogators and multi-mode receivers, radiation-hardened, military-grade two-terminal temperature transducers.\"\n\nThe sale never went through, according to U.S. prosecutors -- but others arranged by Orekhovs company did, including \"a variety of sensitive, military-grade technologies in five transactions totaling over $250,000\" purchased from a New York company between 2018 and 2020.\n\n8:20 a.m.: Hundreds of thousands of people in central and western Ukraine woke up on Saturday to power outages and periodic bursts of gunfire, as Ukrainian air defense tried to shoot down drones and incoming missiles, The Associated Press reported.\n\nRussia has intensified its strikes on power stations, water supply systems and other key infrastructure across the country, the latest phase of the war as it nears the eight-month mark.\n\nUkraine's air force said in a statement Saturday that Russia had launched \"a massive missile attack\" targeting \"critical infrastructure,\" hours after air raid sirens blared across the country. It said that it had downed 18 out of 33 cruise missiles launched from air and sea.\n\n\"Several rockets\" targeting the capital were shot down on Saturday morning, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging service.\n\n7:51 a.m.:\n\n5:34 a.m.: Russian soccer clubs will challenge FIFA at sports highest court next month over emergency rules that let players suspend their contracts and leave since the countrys invasion of Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport set Nov. 21 for an appeal hearing brought against FIFA by eight clubs including Russian champion Zenit St. Petersburg.\n\nThe interim contract rules first applied by FIFA in March and renewed in June let players and coaches leave on loan to join clubs in other countries. Russian clubs are suspended from European competitions this season but the national league has continued.\n\nThe chief executive of Zenit, Alexander Medvedev, said in June the rules amounted to \"robbery\" and did not compensate clubs for players that left.\n\nUkrainian clubs like Shakhtar Donetsk also objected, and said agents tried to exploit uncertainty around its future and take contracted players for free.\n\n4:37 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said Russian forces continue to reinforce crossing points over the Dnipro River, and have completed a barge bridge alongside the damaged Antonovskiy bridge in Kherson. It's likely the first time in decades the Russian military has needed to utilize this kind of bridge. If the barge bridge sustains damage, the update said, it is almost certain Russia will seek to repair or replace damaged sections quickly, as their forces and crossing points over the Dnipro river come under increasing pressure in Kherson.\n\n3:18 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that The Russian withdrawal from western Kherson Oblast has begun. Russian forces likely intend to continue that withdrawal over the next several weeks but may struggle to withdraw in good order if Ukrainian forces choose to attack.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is demonstrably setting conditions for Russia to continue a protracted war in Ukraine, not for a negotiated settlement or offramp. Meanwhile, Russian and Ukrainian sources reported fighting northeast of Kharkiv City along the international border, on the Svatove-Kreminna frontline, and west of Lysychansk.\n\n1:43 a.m.: Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko insisted on Friday that Minsk was not preparing to enter the Ukraine conflict, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThe autocratic leader, a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin, was on a visit to inspect Belarus-made drones, which he said had the potential to cover the border with Ukraine.\n\n\"It would not be desirable for these (drones) to be used in Ukraine,\" the 68-year-old Lukashenko said. \"After all, (Ukrainians) are our people.\"\n\nOn Friday he insisted Minsk did not want to become involved in any war.\n\n\"We are not planning to go anywhere. There is no war as of today. We do not need it,\" he said.\n\n12:02 a.m.: A Russian employee of Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) was killed after being mobilized to fight against Ukraine, despite his bank writing to the draft office seeking an exemption, his lawyer told Reuters on Friday.\n\nTimur Izmailov, 33, an IT specialist at Raiffeisen's Russian operations in Moscow, was conscripted on Sept. 23, two days after President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization order, and died on Oct. 13 after being hit by mortar fire, his lawyer Konstantin Yerokhin said.\n\nCertain workers are exempt from the draft, including commercial bank employees to ensure the stability of the banking system.\n\nBut when Izmailov went to his recruitment office to explain that he was entitled to deferment, \"The military commissar told him he was not on the deferment list, so he had to be mobilized,\" Yerokhin said.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

Patriot is a U.S.-made system deployed in Israel. Barak-8 was jointly developed by Israel and India.\n\nIn parallel to the interceptors - fielded mainly to ward off attacks by Iran or its regional allies - Israel has a radar network that sets off sirens or cellphone alerts to warn citizens to take cover when missiles are launched.\n\nSimilar early warning technologies could be on offer to Ukraine, a spokesperson for Israel's Defence Ministry said.\n\n\"Israel has a policy of supporting Ukraine via humanitarian aid and the delivery of life-saving defensive equipment,\" but would not deliver weapons systems \"due to a variety of operational considerations,\" Gantz told the EU ambassadors.\n\nRussian embassy in Israel declined comment.\n\nReporting by Emily Rose; editing by John Stonestreet and Mark Potter\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The street was cordoned off as dozens of firefighters and emergency staff worked at the scene. Among the four people killed in the district was a pregnant woman.\n\nAcross the street from the ruined building, the offices of Ukraine's energy company were also hit. The facility was probably the intended target of the strike.\n\nMayor Klitschko described the attacks as a \"genocide of the Ukrainian people\", saying, \"The Russians need a Ukraine without Ukrainians.\"\n\nThe city authorities, he added, were expecting air defence systems to be delivered soon to protect the capital from further drone attacks.\n\n\"The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us,\" said President Volodymyr Zelensky, describing the attacks as \"terrorising the civilian population\".\n\nDespite an appeal from the mayor for people to seek shelter, the city's streets were far from deserted.

It said one vessel had received minor damage.\n\nHours later, a statement by the foreign ministry in Moscow said: \"The Russian side cannot guarantee the safety of civilian dry cargo ships participating in the 'Black Sea Initiative', and suspends its implementation from today for an indefinite period.\"\n\nIt said the move was \"in connection with the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces, which were led by British specialists\" and that these actions \"were directed... against Russian ships that ensured the functioning of the said humanitarian corridor\".\n\nMoscow claimed 16 aerial and maritime drones were destroyed, and that only a minesweeper had sustained damage.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether that is indeed the case, with reports suggesting that the flagship frigate was also hit. Claims and counterclaims have become part of this war.\n\nPresident Zelensky said Russia's decision was not one that had been made today, but in September \"when it blocked the movement of ships with our food produce\".\n\n\"Why is it that some handful of individuals somewhere in the Kremlin can decide whether there will be food on the tables of people in Egypt or in Bangladesh?\" he added.\n\nMr Zelensky said a strong international response was needed from both the UN and the world's twenty largest economies.\n\nThe White House said Russia was \"weaponising food\".\n\nA UN spokesman said the organisation, which brokered the deal with Turkey, was in touch with Moscow.\n\nIt added that it was \"vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative\", which it said was a critical humanitarian effort improving access to food for millions of people around the world.\n\nThe agreement allowed Ukraine to resume its Black Sea grain exports, which had been blocked when Russia invaded the country.\n\nIt was personally negotiated by the UN secretary general and celebrated as a major diplomatic victory that helped ease a global food crisis.\n\nBut Russia has complained that its own exports are still hindered, and had previously suggested it might not renew the deal.\n\nReuters\n\nThe Russian Navy at the entrance to the port city of Sevastopol in 2014\n\nIn recent days, Kyiv has accused Moscow of deliberately delaying the passage of ships, creating a queue of more than 170 vessels.\n\nSaturday's drone attack comes as Ukrainian troops successfully retake territory occupied by Russian troops since they launched their invasion on 24 February.\n\nRussia has responded by launching large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly on the country's energy grid.\n\nCrimea was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and is extremely symbolic for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn recent weeks, several attacks have hit the peninsula, where the Russian army has built up a large presence.\n\nSevastopol is the largest city in the region and home to Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-installed governor of the city, said Russia's navy had repelled the latest attack - the \"most massive\" on the city since February.\n\nHe said that all unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) had been shot down and no civilian infrastructure had been damaged.\n\nThe Ukrainian government rarely comments on claims made by Russian authorities in Crimea, although senior officials often celebrate incidents on the peninsula.\n\nUkraine has vowed to recapture all territory that is under Russian occupation, including Crimea, which has been a key base for President Putin's forces during the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWithout providing any evidence, the Russian defence ministry also accused British navy specialists of helping Ukrainian forces prepare the attack on Saturday morning.\n\nIt also said the same unit was \"involved in plotting, organising, and implementation of the terrorist attack in the Baltic Sea on 26 September this year to blow up the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines\".\n\nIn its reply, the MoD said: \"To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.\n\n\"This invented story, says more about arguments going on inside the Russian government than it does about the west.\"\n\nFrance also said it did not believe the Russian allegations.\n\nIn recent days, Russia has been engaged in what US and Ukrainian officials describe as a disinformation campaign, with unsubstantiated claims that Kyiv is preparing to use a radioactive dirty bomb, or even biological mosquitoes.\n\nRussia's Black Sea Fleet was previously targeted in April this year by Ukrainian forces when its flagship warship, the Moskva, was sunk. The 510-crew missile cruiser had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, and its sinking was a major symbolic and military blow.\n\nEarlier this month, a blast occurred on the Crimean bridge - a pivotal symbol of Russia's annexation of Crimea.",

It controls both the only land route to the Crimea peninsula Russia seized in 2014, and the mouth of the Dnipro, the 2,200-kilometre-long (1,367-mile) river that bisects Ukraine.\n\nStaff at Kherson's Russian-backed administration were also being relocated to the eastern side of the Dnipro, Saldo said, although he said Russia had the resources to hold the city and even counter-attack if necessary. Russian forces near Kherson have been driven back by 20-30 km (13-20 miles) in the last few weeks.\n\nEight months after being invaded, Ukraine is pressing major counter-offensives in the east and south to try to take as much territory as it can before winter.\n\nELECTRICITY CUTS\n\nRussia has intensified its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's power and water infrastructure this week in what Ukraine and the West call a campaign to intimidate civilians ahead of the cold winter.\n\nOn Thursday, electricity supply will be restricted nationwide between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., government officials and the grid operator Ukrenergo said. Street lighting in cities will be limited, a presidential aide said on the Telegram messaging app, adding that if electricity use was not minimised, there would be temporary blackouts.\n\nWhile limited to Thursday, \"we do not exclude that with the onset of a cold weather we will be asking for your help even more frequently,\" Ukrenergo said.\n\nRussia has destroyed three Ukrainian energy facilities over the last 24 hours, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Wednesday night video address.\n\nA Russian missile strike hit a major thermal power station in the city of Burshtyn in western Ukraine on Wednesday, the region's governor said.\n\nZelenskiy, who has said a third of his country's power stations have been hit by Russian strikes, discussed security at power supply plants with senior officials.\n\n\"We are working to create mobile power points for the critical infrastructure of cities, towns and villages,\" Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.\n\n\"We are preparing for various scenarios,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n[1/5]A view shows the city administration building hit by recent shelling in the course of Ukraine-Russia conflict, in Donetsk, Russian-controlled Ukraine, October 16, 2022. REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nPUTIN'S POWERS\n\nIn televised remarks to his Security Council, Putin boosted the powers of Russia's regional governors and ordered the creation of a coordinating council under Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to support his \"special military operation\".\n\nHe said the \"entire system of state administration\" must be geared to back up the Ukraine effort.\n\nIt was unclear what the immediate impact of Putin's declaration of martial law would be, beyond much tighter security measures in Kherson and the other three regions.\n\nBut Ukraine, which along with the West does not recognise Moscow's self-styled annexations, derided the move. Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called it \"a pseudo-legalisation of (the) looting of Ukrainians' property.\"\n\n\"This does not change anything for Ukraine: we continue the liberation and deoccupation of our territories,\" he tweeted.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said Putin had found himself in a difficult position and his only tool was to brutalize Ukrainian civilians. The U.S. State Department said it was no surprise that Russia was resorting to \"desperate tactics\".\n\nUkrainian and Russian forces exchanged intermittent artillery fire on a section of the Kherson front in the Mykolaiv region on Wednesday, the impacts marked by towers of smoke.\n\nSeveral Ukrainian soldiers said they were aware of the martial law declaration but were not worried, although they warned a visiting Reuters reporter of the danger presented by Russian drones.\n\n\"For sure he's (Putin) up to no good. We understand that,\" said Yaroslav, who declined to give his last name. \"But whatever they are doing, we will screw them anyway.\"\n\nOleh, who also withheld his last name, said Russia in the past had warned about what it claimed would be escalatory Ukrainian actions only to carry them out itself.\n\n\"We are just concerned about our people in the Kherson region,\" he said.\n\nMoscow denies deliberately targeting civilians, though the conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions and pulverised Ukrainian cities.\n\nThe Kremlin placed a nuclear umbrella over the regions it says it has annexed, among nuclear threats which Britain's chief of defence staff Tony Radakin said signalled desperation.\n\n\"It is a sign of weakness, which is precisely why the international community needs to remain strong and united,\" Radakin said during a speech.\n\nBritish Defence Minister Ben Wallace met his U.S counterpart in Washington this week to discuss shared security concerns about the situation in Ukraine, a senior defence source said in response to speculation around the sudden trip.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Balmforth, Max Hunder and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Andrew Osborn, Philippa Fletcher and Grant McCool; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne, John Stonestreet and Rosalba O'Brien\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

We will gradually come to this - with the help of our partners, I'm confident of this,\" the Ukrainian leader said in a video.\n\nAlmost a third of Ukraine's power stations and other energy-generating facilities have reportedly been destroyed in a wave of air strikes since Monday last week.\n\nThe areas targeted by the latest attacks include the Cherkasy region, south-east of the capital Kyiv, and the city of Khmelnytskyi, further west.\n\nAir strikes and power disruptions were also reported from Odesa in the south to Rivne and Lutsk in the north-west.\n\nThe national electricity operator, Ukrenergo, said the strikes may have caused more damage than intense bombardment earlier this month.\n\nMr Zelensky said that 36 rockets had been launched on Saturday, and most of them had been downed.\n\nReuters\n\nThe latest wave of strikes have also wrecked many homes\n\nThe deputy mayor of the western city of Lviv, Serhiy Kiral, told the BBC on Saturday that Russia's strategy was to damage critical infrastructure before the winter, and bring the war to areas beyond the front line.\n\n\"The more successes the Ukrainian armed forces are having at the front the worse it's going to be for people on the home front because Russia is going to do all it can to target civilians and to target critical infrastructure,\" he said in an interview with the Newshour radio programme.\n\nOn Friday Mr Zelensky accused Russia of planting mines at a hydroelectric dam in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, which is under the control of Moscow's forces.\n\nHe said that if the Kakhovka hydropower plant was destroyed, hundreds of thousands of people would be in danger of flooding. Russia has denied planning to blow up the dam and said Ukraine was firing missiles at it.\n\nThe dam may provide Russia with one of the few remaining routes across the River Dnieper (called Dnipro by Ukrainians) in the partially occupied Kherson region.\n\nThousands of civilians have been leaving the city of Kherson in recent days, as Ukrainian forces advance.\n\nAnd on Saturday a new directive from occupying Russian authorities was released, renewing its appeal for civilians to leave \"immediately\".\n\nThe transfer or deportation of civilians by an occupying power from occupied territory is considered a war crime. In September, the UN said there were already credible accusations of forced deportation of Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied areas.\n\nRussia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzia, said the allegations were unfounded.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's armed forces said that Russian troops on Saturday had left two villages - Charivne and Chkalove - in Kherson region. The claim has not been independently verified.",

The bridge is a symbol of his campaign to incorporate large swathes of Ukraine into Russia.\n\nA power station employee called Pavlo, quoted by AFP news agency, said \"we are confronted by such damage for the first time\". The unnamed plant had twice been targeted by missiles and then by an Iranian-made \"kamikaze\" drone.\n\nHe said repairs had been under way for more than two weeks, but \"there are difficulties in that the equipment that has been damaged is unique - it's hard to find the same parts\".\n\nIn other developments:\n\nThe Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol said that Russian naval forces had repelled a drone attack in waters off the port city. Mikhail Razvozhayev said no facilities in the city, the largest in annexed Crimea and HQ of Moscow's Black Sea Fleet, had been hit. Ukraine has not acknowledged the incident.\n\nRussia said it had mobilised 300,000 reservists - the target number set by defence minister Sergei Shoigu. He said 41,000 of those called up had already been deployed to the battlefield in Ukraine\n\nRussia also said it had completed an operation to move thousands of civilians out of occupied Kherson, ahead of an expected battle with Ukrainian forces for the strategic southern city\n\nPresident Zelensky accused Russia of dismantling medical facilities in Kherson - removing \"equipment, ambulances, just everything\" - and pressurising doctors to move to Russia\n\nChechen leader and Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov admitted that a Chechen unit had suffered \"big losses\" - 23 fighters killed and 58 wounded in a Ukrainian artillery attack\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged all parties to renew the grain export deal, which is due to expire next month.

                "cc_text": "Russia has begun raining Iranian-made drones and loitering munitions down on Ukraine, using them to attack both infrastructure and civilians. So far, the operational impact of these drones appears to be limited. However, if Russia deploys them in greater numbers, begins to use them in combination with other systems or in swarms, or better integrates them within its military operations, they could still pose a significant threat to Ukrainian forces, civilians, and infrastructure.\n\nRussia has undergone a remarkable demotion from being one of Irans main arms suppliers to now relying on Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, or drones) and loitering munitions. Their use confirms that Russias own unmanned aircraft programme is not up to the task; nor is its air force, which has failed to destroy Ukraines air defences or achieve control of its air space, while providing poor-quality support to ground troops.\n\nRussian forces are using at least three different Iranian-made systems two of which this author previously identified as likely candidates for sale to Moscow: the Mohajer-6, a tactical combat UAV with a 200km range that is capable of launching small precision-guided munitions and anti-tank missiles; and the Shahed-136 loitering munitions (alongside its little brother, the Shahed-131). The Mohajer and Shahed platforms differ substantially from one another in capabilities and purpose. The former is more versatile and used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance as well as strike operations; the latter is a small satellite-guided missile used only to directly attack targets.\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles, including the Mohajer-6\n\nMoscow has been forced to look for off-the-shelf drone solutions from Iran because of the sporadic availability and negligible impact of its own combat UAVs, such as the Forpost-R a licensed upgraded copy of the Israeli Searcher Mk. II and the Orion (Inokhodets). Without these alternatives, the Russian forces lack drones that can provide decent target acquisition and persistent precision strike capabilities. The Russian military has only a limited number of systems and has integrated them poorly within its units, leading to limited results in finding, interdicting, and engaging enemy units. This immature concept of operations on how to integrate and effectively employ UAVs has led to poor results on the ground and highlights the full extent of Russias UAV operational failure. This is especially the case for scouting, identifying, and destroying targets, as well as situational awareness according to statements and complaints from Russian soldiers. The military has recently made attempts to address this situation, for instance through a \"Dronnitsa\" (drone) quadcopter workshop in early September and UAV training sessions for conscripted troops. This suggests a change in Russian officers mindset, though it may well be too little, too late.\n\nThe Mohajer-6 is similar to the Turkish-made TB2 that Ukraines armed forces are using (though the TB2 can fly for longer than the Iranian model and at higher altitudes). The Mohajer can carry up to four Ghaem-series precision guided munitions, Almas anti-tank guided missiles, or unguided Hydra rockets, while its thermal sensors and laser rangefinder mean it can be deployed in both day and night operations. Russian forces likely intend to use this platform to identify and engage high-value targets such as long-range artillery systems, command-and-control nodes, and tactical assembly areas deeper behind Ukrainian lines. This is both the primary purpose of the Mohajer-6 and the type of UAV capability the Russians have lacked the most up to now.\n\nLoitering munitions, including the Shaheds\n\nAlongside the Mohajer-6, Russia is using the Shahed-131 and 136 loitering munitions (renamed Geran 1 and 2 by the Russians) to make up for both the disappointing performance of its air force and the dwindling availability of long-range munitions capable of precision strikes. Stocks of these missiles have depleted considerably since the start of the war, and they could now be more difficult to produce because of Western sanctions on key electronic components.\n\nRussia is mainly using the Shahed loitering munitions to attack civilian targets and power infrastructure. Strikes on military objectives, including artillery and headquarters, have been the exception rather than the rule which could cast doubt on the strategic significance of these weapons in the strict operational sense. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to prematurely disregard their role, particularly given the psychological effect on the Ukrainian population and the possibility of deploying these systems in large, coordinated groups (or swarms).\n\nShaheds offer several advantages. They are both quickly deployable in swarms via truck-mounted containers and relatively cheap, with an approximate cost of $20,000 per unit. They also have a long range of around 1,500km and 900km for the 136 and 131 variants, respectively. Furthermore, their design and slow cruising speed mean they can easily avoid radar detection. Their deployment in swarms could therefore saturate Ukrainian air defence systems and cause significant damage. The rumoured delivery by Iran of Arash-2 loitering munitions which have a longer range and much heavier warhead could permit Russia to inflict greater damage, more deeply into Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe two Shahed systems are relatively small, slow-flying (180-200kmh) delta-wing missiles that rely primarily on a global navigation (GNSS) or global positioning (GPS) satellite and inertial guidance systems to attack at specific geographic coordinates. They can also be fitted with an imaging infrared (IIR) or anti-radiation seeker for target identification and suppression of air defences. This means that they are effective only against preselected stationary targets (unlike \"kamikaze\" drones, which can select their own static or moving targets).\n\nAs a solution, Russian military commentators have proposed their use in tandem with spotting drones such as the Mohajer-6, as part of a single interface dubbed by these commentators a \"reconnaissance-strike complex\". When used in this way, the spotting drones find targets and quickly relay their coordinates to the Shahed or a centralised UAV command unit, reducing the delay between target identification and engagement. This would also improve the accuracy of these systems against moving targets such as HIMARS and mechanised columns, and increase their operational impact. For the time being, it is unlikely that Russia has the capacity to establish such a military ecosystem and deploy UAVs and loitering munitions together in this way.\n\nThe Shaheds also have limitations. Ukrainian engineers who disassembled a downed Shahed loitering munition have confirmed that their internal components, such as their processing units and GNSS guidance system, are mostly civilian-grade and are vulnerable to electronic warfare. If the satellite signal is jammed or spoofed, Shaheds can rely on the back-up inertial navigation system, though their accuracy significantly diminishes. Russia has installed more resilient GNSS satellite navigation modules to offer additional protection against electronic warfare, but this seems only partially effective, according to Ukrainian sources. The use of radar decoys by Ukrainian forces, moreover, could deceive the drones anti-radiation seekers, if they have them installed. And, last but not least, their slow speed and low altitude means they are vulnerable to shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles like the Stinger or anti-aircraft guns such as the German-made Gepard. Some Ukrainian soldiers have even suggested they could be downed by Soviet-era heavy machine guns.\n\nHow to help Ukraine defend against Russias Iranian drones\n\nBoth the potential and weaknesses of the Shaheds make the delivery to Ukraine of additional short- and medium-range air defence systems even more urgent. Missile defences such as the NASAMS and IRIS-T are best suited for protecting critical infrastructure and cities, but the West should consider sending self-propelled options, including the French-made Crotale and additional anti-aircraft autocannons like the Gepard. These would provide Ukrainian troops with effective point and manoeuvre defence capabilities against loitering munitions along Ukrainian frontlines.\n\nDrones and loitering munitions alone cannot solve the structural problems affecting the Russian military\n\nDrones and loitering munitions alone cannot solve the structural problems affecting the Russian military. Nevertheless, the proliferation and widespread use of loitering munitions should prompt Western partners to help Kyiv build a layered air-defence complex that integrates conventional missile defence systems with powerful electronic warfare capabilities. European decision-makers should also work to improve their own countermeasures against potential Russian attacks on military and civilian targets, while also developing and integrating this technology into their armed forces.",

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nSummary Ukraine facing 'critical' power situation, says official\n\nThree dead in new strikes in Kyiv\n\nZelenskiy accuses Russia of targeting civilians\n\nMoscow says it is hitting infrastructure\n\nNew Russian commander acknowledges difficulties\n\nKYIV/MYKOLAIV, Ukraine, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The new commander of Russian forces in Ukraine made a rare acknowledgment of the pressures they are under from Ukrainian offensives to retake southern and eastern areas that Moscow claims to have annexed just weeks ago.\n\nAnd in another sign of Russian concern about the situation on the ground eight months into its invasion, the Kremlin-installed chief of the strategic southern region of Kherson on Tuesday announced an \"organised, gradual displacement\" of civilians from four towns on the Dnipro River.\n\nRussian forces in Kherson have been driven back by 20-30 km (13-20 miles) in the last few weeks and are at risk of being pinned against the western bank of the 2,200-kilometre-long (1,367-mile-long) Dnipro river that bisects Ukraine.\n\n\"The situation in the area of the 'Special Military Operation' can be described as tense,\" Sergei Surovikin, a Russian air force general named this month to take charge, told the state-owned Rossiya 24 television news channel.\n\nOn Kherson, Surovikin said: \"The situation in this area is difficult. The enemy is deliberately striking infrastructure and residential buildings in Kherson.\"\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia have denied targeting civilians, although Kyiv has accused Moscow's forces of war crimes.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered what he calls a \"special military operation\" on Feb. 24 because he said he wanted to ensure Russian security and protect Russian-speakers in Ukraine. Ukraine and its allies accuse Moscow of an unprovoked war to grab territory from its pro-Western neighbour.\n\nCONTINUOUS ATTACK\n\nRussian troop positions in Kupiansk and Lyman in eastern Ukraine and the area between Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih in Kherson province were cited by Surovikin as under continuous attack.\n\nHe appeared to concede that there was a danger of Ukrainian forces advancing towards the city of Kherson, which lies near the mouth of the Dnipro on the west bank, and is hard for Russia to resupply from the east because the main bridge across the Dnipro has been badly damaged by Ukrainian bombing.\n\nRussia captured the city largely unopposed in the early days of the invasion, and it remains the only major Ukrainian city that Moscow's forces have seized intact.\n\nKherson is one of four partially-occupied Ukrainian provinces that Russia claims to have annexed, and arguably the most strategically important. It controls both the only land route to the Crimea peninsula Russia seized in 2014, and the mouth of the Dnipro.\n\nAfter staging referendums in September that Ukraine and its allies said were illegal and coercive, Putin proclaimed the annexations of the eastern border provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk - together forming an important industrial region known as the Donbas - as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south.\n\nVladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed Kherson region chief, said the risk of attack by Ukrainian forces led to a decision to evacuate some civilians from four towns.\n\n\"The Ukrainian side is building up forces for a large-scale offensive,\" Saldo said in a video statement. The Russian military was preparing to repel the offensive, he said, and \"where the military operates, there is no place for civilians. Let the Russian army fulfil its task.\"\n\nSurovikin has been nicknamed \"General Armageddon\" in Russian media after serving in Syria and Chechnya, where his forces pounded cities to rubble in a brutal but effective scorched earth policy against its foes.\n\nHis appointment was rapidly followed on Oct. 10 by the biggest wave of missile strikes against Ukraine since the start of the war.\n\nRAIN OF MISSILES, DRONES\n\nPutin cast the air strikes using missiles and drones as revenge for an explosion that damaged Russia's bridge to Crimea. The Kyiv government has not claimed responsibility for that attack but celebrated the destruction of what it considers a military target used to transport arms and troops.\n\nUkraine has invited United Nations experts to inspect what it says are downed Iranian-origin drones used by Russia to attack Ukrainian targets, in violation of a U.N. Security Council resolution that endorsed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, according to a letter seen by Reuters.\n\nRussia's dependence on Iranian-made drones to attack Ukrainian targets exposes Russia as militarily bankrupt, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asserted in his Tuesday night video address.\n\nHe said that after decades of funding the Soviet and post-Soviet defence industry, \"in the end, they bowed down to Tehran in order to secure quite simple drones and missiles.\"\n\nUkraine accuses Russia of using Iran-made Shahed-136 \"kamikaze drones\", which fly to their target and detonate. Iran denies supplying them and on Tuesday the Kremlin also denied using them.\n\nHowever, two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats told Reuters that Tehran had promised to provide Russia with more drones as well as surface-to-surface missiles.\n\nIn the north in the capital Kyiv, Russia rained more missiles down on infrastructure in what Ukraine and the West call a campaign to intimidate civilians.\n\nRussia has destroyed almost a third of Ukraine's power stations in the past week, Zelenskiy said. Russia had targeted more than 10 regions in the past 24 hours, Zelenskiy said in his video address. He urged Ukrainians to cut back on electricity consumption in the evenings.\n\nMissiles struck power stations in Kyiv and elsewhere on Tuesday, causing blackouts and knocking out water supplies. A day earlier, Russia sent swarms of drones to attack infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities, killing at least five people.\n\nReporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Andrew Osborn and Gareth Jones; Editing by Philippa Fletcher, Peter Graff and Rosalba O'Brien\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\nThe US Defense Department is trying to speed up the delivery of two advanced surface-to-air missile systems to Ukraine as Russia has increasingly used Iranian-supplied drones that explode on impact to pummel Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.\n\nThe Pentagons effort is just the latest evidence of a newly urgent push by the US and its allies to help Ukraine build a comprehensive air and missile defense system to protect itself against these drones, which killed four in an attack on Kyiv on Monday.\n\nThe drones have become an increasingly urgent problem for Ukraine, and one that has drawn US condemnation. The State Department on Monday said that the drones are a violation of a UN Security Council resolution which restricts certain arms transfers to or from Iran.\n\nWith its reserves of precision munitions believed to be running low, Moscow has turned to these loitering drones to maintain its ability to strike high-value targets and terrorize Ukrainian cities from afar, Western analysts say. In recent days, they have been used to strike energy infrastructure.\n\nUnlike more traditional, larger and faster military drones that return to base after dropping missiles, the Iranian-supplied drones are designed to crash into a target and explode, detonating their warhead and destroying the drones in the process. They are smaller and more easily controlled than cruise missiles.\n\nThe US doesnt know exactly how many drones Iran has provided to Russia, but military analysts say the number is clearly substantial. Russia fired 43 on Monday alone, with 37 shot down by air defense systems, according to Ukraines Air Force. One US defense official estimated the total number to be in the hundreds.\n\n\"The big effect is definitely economic exhaustion, attacking Ukraines electricity availability going into the winter and also keeping the war nationwide,\" said Michael Kofman, the director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses. \"Theyre essentially using these drones as sort of a poor mans precision guided weapon against Ukrainian infrastructure.\"\n\nA US defense official told CNN Monday that the Pentagon is now trying to accelerate the delivery of two National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS systems owned by 12 nations and already used to protect Washington, DC.\n\nThe US has already committed eight NASAMS to Ukraine including the two being accelerated, according to Pentagon officials.\n\nThe US first announced it would send two NASAMs to Ukraine on July 1 in a Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package of military assistance and announced it would send six more on August 24.\n\nThe systems are currently being manufactured by Raytheon in a joint partnership with Norways Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace, according to the Pentagon. The US now is hoping to complete manufacturing two of the systems by the end of October or early November perhaps as much as a full month sooner than originally slated.\n\nOnce the systems are completed, they must still be transported to Ukraine. The NASAMS will be flown to a nearby country and then shipped over land into Ukraine.\n\nDrone attacks reflect Russian weakness\n\nEven as they remain deeply concerned about the success Russia has had with the Iranian drones, sources familiar with the intelligence and Western military analysts say that their heavy usage reflects a weakness in Russias arsenal.\n\nWestern officials believe that Russia is running low on its precision guided munitions, and, according to one source familiar with Western intelligence, is likely on the brink of dipping into its strategic reserves to continue the war.\n\nLater on Monday the top US spy chief said Russia has been firing its precision munitions \"at an unsustainable rate,\" leaving them reliant on lower-end weapons and technological band-aids that \"are probably leading to weapons and systems that are less capable.\"\n\n\"Russia entered the war with prodigious stocks of munitions, but it has been firing them at an unsustainable rate,\" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told an intelligence conference in Washington. \"This is especially true for high-end precision weapons such as cruise missiles they use in strikes on Ukraines electric grid and other targets. In short, theyre running through their stocks.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Haines said, US sanctions and export controls have helped contribute to \"major supply shortages in Ukraine,\" forcing Russia to turn to Iran and North Korea, as well as rely on makeshift solutions.\n\n\"Export controls have forced Russia to rely on contraband chips where it can and to frankly jury rig microelectronic components when no alternatives exist steps that are probably leading to weapons and systems that are less capable,\" she said.\n\nRussia still has plenty of older, less precise Soviet weapons, the source familiar with Western intelligence said although its not clear how much of the old Soviet stockpiles Moscow has managed to bring to the fight because the West doesnt know how many were sold or stripped for parts after the Cold War.\n\nStill, Ukraine remains deeply vulnerable to attack from the air.\n\nAt a meeting of allied defense chiefs focused on Ukrainian aid last week, US Chairman of the Joint chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said that the US and its allies should contribute air defense systems they have and then help Ukraine knit the systems together to create a comprehensive defense.\n\n\"Many countries have other systems, theres a whole series of Israeli systems that are quite capable. The Germans have systems as we mentioned, so a lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems,\" Milley said.\n\nMilley suggested if multiple countries send the air defense systems they have, Ukrainians can \"link\" them together \"with a command and control and communication systems.\"",

                "cc_text": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) Ukrainian forces attacked Russias hold on the southern city of Kherson on Thursday while fighting intensified in the countrys east. The battles came amid reports that Moscow-appointed authorities have abandoned the city, joining tens of thousands of residents who fled to other Russia-held areas.\n\nUkrainian forces were surrounding Kherson from the west and attacking Russias foothold on the west bank of the Dnieper River, which divides the region and the country.\n\nAs the battles unfolded, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow has no intention to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, despite issuing repeated warnings in the past that he was prepared to use all available means to defend Russia, including its nuclear arsenal.\n\n\"We see no need for that,\" Putin said at a conference of international foreign policy experts outside Moscow. \"There is no point in that, neither political nor military.\"\n\nThe Russian leader, who insisted for weeks before the invasion that he did not intend to attack Ukraine, also sought to cast the conflict as part of efforts by the West to secure global domination. He accused the U.S. and its allies of trying to dictate their terms to other nations in a \"dangerous and bloody\" domination game.\n\nPutin, whose troops invaded on Feb. 24, has described Western support for Ukraine as part of broad efforts by Washington and its allies to enforce what they call a rules-based world order that only foments chaos.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia warned that Moscow could target Western commercial satellites used for military purposes in support of Ukraine, and a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the United States of pursuing \"thoughtless and mad\" escalation.\n\nSpokeswoman Maria Zakharova argued that Washington should take an approach more like it did during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, when the Cold War superpowers stepped back from the brink of nuclear confrontation.\n\n\"The more the U.S. is drawn into supporting the Kyiv regime on the battlefield, the more they risk provoking a direct military confrontation between the biggest nuclear powers fraught with catastrophic consequences,\" Zakharova said.\n\nUkraine has pushed ahead with an offensive to reclaim the Kherson region and its capital of the same name, which Russian forces captured during the first days of a war now in its ninth month.\n\nMore than 70,000 residents from the Kherson city area have evacuated in recent days, the regions Kremlin-installed governor, Vladimir Saldo, said Thursday.\n\nMembers of the Russia-backed regional administration also fled, the deputy governor, Kirill Stremousov said. Monuments to Russian heroes were moved, along with the remains of Grigory Potemkin, the Russian general who founded Kherson in the 18th century. His remains were kept at the citys St. Catherines Church.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described reports of Russian troops possible withdrawal from the city as disinformation.\n\n\"I dont see them fleeing from Kherson,\" Zelenskyy said in an interview with Italys Corriere della Sera newspaper. \"This is an information attack, so that we go there, transfer troops from other dangerous directions there.\"\n\nZelenskyy also dismissed as \"theater\" recent attempts by local Kremlin-backed officials to persuade the citys civilian residents to relocate deeper into Russian-held territory ahead of the Ukrainian advance.\n\n\"Their most trained soldiers are in position. We see this and do not believe them,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, Russian forces continued to bombard the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, making slow gains toward the center.\n\nThe deputy head of Russias delegation at a U.N. arms control panel, Konstantin Vorontsov, described the use of U.S. and other Western commercial satellites for military purposes during the fighting as \"extremely dangerous.\"\n\n\"The quasi-civilian infrastructure could be a legitimate target for a retaliatory strike,\" Vorontsov warned.\n\nAs they have all month, Russian forces carried out attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure that have caused increasing worry ahead of winter.\n\nA Russian drone attack early Thursday hit an energy facility near the capital of Kyiv, causing a fire, said Kyiv regional Gov. Oleksiy Kuleba. He said the latest attacks inflicted \"very serious damage.\"\n\nKuleba announced new rolling blackouts and urged consumers to save power. He said authorities were still pondering how to restore service.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraines presidential office, said rolling blackouts would also be introduced in the neighboring Chernihiv, Cherkasy and Zhytomyr regions.\n\nZelenskyy has said that Russian attacks have already destroyed 30% of the countrys energy infrastructure.\n\nIn a likely response to Russias assaults on Ukrainian infrastructure, a drone attacked a power plant just outside Sevastopol, a port in the Russian-annexed region of Crimea. The plant sustained minor damage, according to city leader Mikhail Razvozhayev. He said electricity supplies were uninterrupted.\n\nCrimea was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. It has faced drone attacks and explosions amid the fighting in Ukraine. In a major setback for the Kremlin, a powerful truck bomb blew up a section of a strategic bridge linking Crimea to Russias mainland on Oct. 8.\n\nA senior Ukrainian military officer accused Russia of planning to stage explosions at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and blame them on Ukraine in a false-flag attack.\n\nGen. Oleksii Gromov, the chief of the main operational department of the Ukrainian militarys general staff, pointed to Moscows repeated unfounded allegations that Ukraine was plotting to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb as a possible signal that Moscow was planning explosions at the plant, Europes largest nuclear power station.\n\nRussia took control of the Zaporizhzhia plant in the opening days of the invasion. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of attacking the plant, which had its reactors shut down following continuous shelling.\n\nElsewhere, Ukrainian authorities reported that another mass grave was discovered in territory recently reclaimed from Russia. It contained up to 17 bodies of soldiers and civilians.\n\nThe Ukrainian Interior Ministry said in a statement that police found the grave outside the city of Izium after being tipped off by local residents.\n\nThe statement cited locals as saying that Russian troops dumped bodies in a pit outside the nearby village of Kopanky in mid-April, then leveled the ground with tanks.\n\nIn other developments, Ukrainian authorities said they were launching a criminal case against Russias childrens rights commissioner, accusing her of enabling the abduction and forced adoption of thousands of vulnerable Ukrainian children.\n\nMaria Lvova-Belova said this week that she herself has adopted a boy seized by the Russian army in the bombed-out city of Mariupol.\n\nLast month, she was sanctioned by the U.S., U.K. and other Western nations over allegations that she masterminded the removal of over 2,000 vulnerable children from the embattled Donetsk and Luhansk region in Ukraines east. According to Ukraine, she orchestrated a new policy to facilitate their forced placement with \"foster families\" in Russia.\n\nZelenskyy ended the day on an emotional note, pointing out in his nightly address to the nation that Ukraine on Friday marks the anniversary of its liberation from the Nazis in World War II. This year, he said, the holiday carries special significance.\n\n\"Evil always ends the same way. The occupier becomes a capitulator, the invader a fugitive. War criminals become defendants. Aggression becomes a court verdict. Destruction turns into reparations. Enemy equipment becomes museum exhibits,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n___\n\nFollow APs coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

In total, Russia attacked Ukraine with 42 drones on Monday and 36 were shot down, according to Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs adviser Anton Gerashchenko.\n\nBecause the Russian attack also targeted energy facilities in south and central Ukraine, the country's national energy company Ukrenergo said it could not rule out the possibility of rolling blackouts in the affected areas.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said on Twitter that \"Iran is responsible for the murders of Ukrainians, adding that the country \"oppresses its own people\" and is now giving Russia \"weapons for mass murders in the heart of Europe.\"\n\n\"That is what unfinished business and concessions to totalitarianism mean,\" Podolyak tweeted. \"The case when sanctions are not enough.\"\n\nState Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said at a press briefing on Monday that Irans supply of the drones did appear to be a violation of UN Security Council resolution 2231, a key provision of the Iran nuclear agreement. He said further sanctions against Iran could be a possibility.\n\n\"Russia deepening an alliance with Iran is something the whole world, especially those in the region and across the world, frankly, should be seen as a profound threat and its something that any country should pay very close attention to,\" Patel said.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry did not directly acknowledge drone strikes on Kyiv, but said Monday it used \"high-precision long-range air and sea-based weapons\" to strike what it said were military and energy targets in Ukraine.",

They are also called \"loitering\" munitions.\n\nLike cruise missiles, they can hit targets hundreds of kilometres away, but cruise missiles are expensive, and Gatopoulos said \"kamikaze\" drones are a cheaper, yet precise, alternative.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had bought 2,400 \"kamikaze\" drones but its fleet is being depleted quickly.\n\nWhere do they come from?\n\nUkraine says Russia imported the drones from Iran, where they are known as Shahed-136, which could be translated as \"witness of faith\" but also as \"martyr\".\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, accused Tehran of being responsible for the \"murders of Ukrainians\". The Kremlin did not comment.\n\nIran, which has called NATOs presence in Eastern Europe the root cause of the war, has denied supplying Russia with arms.\n\nGatopoulos said the drones are unlikely to be Russian-made because Moscow \"has been behind in developing low-end tactical drones, especially armed ones\".\n\nSamir Puri, an analyst at Kings College London, told Al Jazeera that some form of a sales agreement is likely to have taken place between Moscow and Tehran.\n\nThese drones were \"bought off the shelf from Iran, moved to the war zone and being used, I think, very much as a weapon that will continue to confuse Ukrainian air defences by adding something else in the mix,\" Puri said.\n\nWill they change the course of the war in Ukraine?\n\n\"Kamikaze\" drones cost significantly less than cruise missiles, but they still arent cheap.\n\nOne reportedly costs about $20,000, Puri said.\n\n\"Thats actually quite a lot when you think about the fact that they are, by definition, a one-use weapon.\"\n\nTheir use in swarms presents a challenge to Ukrainian air defences, a Ukrainian air force spokesman told The Associated Press.\n\nWestern nations have promised to bolster Kyivs fight with systems that can shoot down drones, but much of that weaponry has yet to arrive and, in some cases, may be months away.\n\nWhile the deployment of unmanned aircraft \"will give the Ukrainians yet another weapons system to worry about\", it is unlikely to be a game changer, said Puri.\n\n\"In and of themselves, no one weapon system of this nature can change the outcome of the war,\" he said.",

They are known as \"kamikaze\" drones because they are destroyed in the attack - named after the Japanese fighter pilots who flew suicide missions in World War Two.\n\nUkraine says around 400 drones have already been used by Russia, from a total order of roughly 2,000 weapons.\n\nBut Tehran has repeatedly denied that it has struck any arms deal with the Kremlin, and Moscow also denies using Iranian drones.\n\nOn Wednesday, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian called the accusations \"baseless\" and urged Ukraine to \"present any evidence supporting the accusations\".\n\n\"If... it becomes clear to us that Russia has used Iranian drones in the war against Ukraine, we will definitely not be indifferent about this issue,\" he added.\n\nTehran's regional adversary, Israel, has also attacked Iran over the alleged exports. During a meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday, President Isaac Herzog slammed the regime's activities.\n\n\"The fact that Iran, following its activities in killing its own citizens, in working towards nuclear weapons endlessly, endangering the entire world and the region and now killing innocent civilians in Ukraine, clearly that gives you a picture of what Iran is all about,\" Mr Herzog said.\n\nPrior to the visit, he had pledged to share \"proof\" with Mr Biden that Iran was supplying the weapons.\n\nMeanwhile, US officials have said they will supply Ukraine with an additional $275m (237m) of military aid, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe assistance is expected to be used to restock ammunition for Ukrainian artillery systems, including the HIMARS launchers that Kyiv's forces have used to great effect.\n\nOn the ground, fighting has slowed in recent days, with a much anticipated Ukrainian advance on the southern city of Kherson stalled due to poor weather.",

DW has the latest.\n\nThe head of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson in southern Ukraine says pro-Kremlin administrative officials are transporting people away from the regional capital to the left bank of the Dnipro River ahead of an expected offensive by Ukrainian forces.\n\n\"The entire administration is already moving today,\" Moscow-installed regional head Vladimir Saldo, said on Russian state television.\n\nKherson is one of four partially-occupied Ukrainian regions that Russia \"annexed\" following referendums widely judged as illegal.\n\nSaldo said some 40% of civilians would moved from potential conflict zones as a \"precaution.\"\n\nHowever, he said Moscow's forces would keep fighting.\n\n\"No one is going to hand over Kherson. But it is not ideal for residents to be in the city where hostilities will take place,\" Saldo said.\n\n\"We're expecting attacks. The Ukrainians are not hiding this. We have enough strength and capability to repel these attacks,\" he warned. \"The city will be completely held, but we need to keep civilians safe.\"\n\nSaldo earlier announced the civilians would be transported from four communities near the Dnipro River, citing the risk that Ukrainian shelling could damage a nearby dam.\n\nSome 50,000 to 60,000 people are to be relocated from the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, according to the Russian state-run news agency TASS.\n\nDW correspondent Mathias Blinger said there was a fear in Ukraine that people would be evacuated against their will.\n\n\"The fear here in Ukraine is of course that these may be forced evacuations deportations of people into Russia as we have seen in other parts of the occupied territories; that the Russians would forcibly drive people out of there and relocate them to Russia in order to maybe assimilate them later into Russian society. That would be a war crime.\"\n\nAround 5 million people have left for Russia from the four regions Moscow annexed in violation of international law, Nikolai Patrushev secretary of Russia's National Security Council claimed.\n\nIn a separate statement, Russia's Defense Ministry asserted that 4.6 million Ukrainians have arrived in the country since the start of the war.\n\nOccupied Kherson relocates residents To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHere are the other main headlines from the war in Ukraine on October 19.\n\nPutin bringing the war home to ordinary Russians, investigative journalist tells DW\n\nInvestigative journalist and writer Catherine Belton, who works for The Washington Post and is the author of the 2020 book Putin's People, told DW that Putin was becoming increasingly vulnerable in Russia due to the Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nShe explained her concern that the forced removal of citizens in Kherson could be used for a \"misinformation campaign.\" However, if Ukraine successfully took control of Kherson, this would signify a big loss for Putin. Asked about Putin's strategic options, the journalist highlighted that the Russian president had \"been backed into forcing the mobilization of his own people.\"\n\n\"He'd always promised that he was never going to have to do that. It's a deeply unpopular step, which really undermines the foundations of his own presidency. His legitimacy as president is based on his popularity,\" she continued.\n\nBut not only Putin's strategy options were becoming slimmer, his popularity among Russians at home was decreasing, too, Belton claimed: \"There was a recent opinion poll by the Kremlin linked Public Opinion Foundation, which found that 70% of Russians are now very, very anxious about what's going on. He's really bringing the situation home to ordinary Russians. So I think his position is much more precarious than it's ever been in his entire presidency.\"\n\nBelton went on to say that his standing within the elites had been affected. \"We're seeing divisions emerge within the elite around him.\"\n\n\"They're seeing Putin lose territory. And that's not just a loss to his popularity. It's kind of a loss to his standing within the elite. And suddenly he is becoming fair game,\" she added.\n\nBelton: Putin's position 'precarious' To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nUkraine to impose nationwide electricity restrictions\n\nAuthorities in Ukraine will impose restrictions on the use of electricity starting on Thursday, as continued Russian strikes over the past several days have crippled energy infrastructure.\n\nLarge parts of Ukraine have been hit with electricity and water outages.\n\n\"Today the enemy again destroyed energy generating facilities...it is necessary to minimize the use of electricity,\" said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president's office.\n\n\"Everyone should be ready, first, to save electricity, and second, rolling power blackouts are also possible if strikes continue,\" Tymoshenko said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that 30% of Ukraine's power stations have been destroyed.\n\nMissile strike hits major power plant in western Ukraine\n\nA thermal power station in the city of Burshtyn in western Ukraine was hit in a Russian attack on Wednesday, according to the Ivano-Frankivsk region governor Svitlana Onyshchuk.\n\nShe said no one was hurt in the strike that caused a fire at the plant but gave no further details of the damage.\n\nWednesday's salvo hit the Burshtyn plant that supplies electricity to three western regions and 5 million consumers.\n\nThe aftermath of a Russian strike on a power station in Kharkiv Image: Kostiantyn Liberov/AP/picture alliance\n\nIAEA's Grossi tells DW risk of accident is 'quite high' at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi told DW in an interview that the situation around the plant was \"really dangerous,\" and \"precarious.\"\n\nHis team has been working for weeks to establish a protection zone in the area, he said, but has not been successful yet.\n\nGrossi said that they were still negotiating the zone, but that \"both sides have agreed to work with me, so I hope we will be able to make progress pretty soon.\"\n\nHe said that a comparison with Chernobyl was not appropriate, because the technology was very different and because \" it's a much bigger plant\" with constant risks to its power supply.\n\nAsked whether Putin may use nuclear weapons amid a series of military setbacks, Grossi replied: \"I don't have any indication that would be the case.\"\n\nIAEA chief renews call for Zaporizhzhia safe zone To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nPutin declares martial law in occupied regions\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has introduced martial law in the occupied regions of Ukraine that Moscow claims to have annexed.\n\nThe Kremlin published a decree saying martial law would be introduced from early Thursday in the Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\n\"I signed a decree to introduce martial law in these four subjects of the Russian Federation,\" Putin said in a televised National Security Council meeting.\n\nPutin didn't initially spell out the measures that would be taken under martial law in the regions.\n\nIsrael offers Ukraine help with air-attack alerts but not weapons\n\nIsrael has offered to help Ukrainians develop air attack alerts for civilians, but was adamant it would stop short of sending weapons or its vaunted Iron Dome missile defense system to Kyiv.\n\n\"Maybe we can support them with an early warning systems that will allow them to alert the right population in a more accurate manner, which will then allow them to have some kind of long perspective emergency routine,\" Defense Minister Benny Gantz said.\n\nAfter a barrage of strikes on Ukrainian cities this week the country's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he would ask Israel for immediate air defense supplies.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also in the past hit out at Israel for not providing Kyiv with weapon systems.\n\nThough it has condemned the Russian invasion, Israel said it wanted to continue cooperation with Moscow over war-ravaged neighbor Syria.\n\n\"The policy towards Ukraine will not change. We will continue to support it and stand by the West. We will not supply weapons,\" Gantz said in Tel Aviv, during a meeting with the ambassadors of the European Union.\n\nRussians 'scared' as reality of war hits home, says dissident journalist\n\nRussian news editor and presenter of TV Rain, Ekaterina Kotrikadze, said in an interview with DW that Russians were becoming increasingly concerned about the war in Ukraine.\n\nTV Rain was one of the last Kremlin-critical news networks in Russia before being shut down. Kotrikadze now works from abroad.\n\nShe was asked about how Putin declaring martial law in Ukraine affects the Russian public's perception of the war.\n\n\"This is something that brings us very close to the moment when the president of the Russian Federation and his employees, including their representatives of the Russian government, would be forced to name this situation a war. Because, so far, they were insisting on the so-called \"special military operation,\" not acknowledging and not telling Russians that this is actually a war going on not only in Ukraine but also on the parts of Russian Federation.\"\n\nKotrikadze said areas of Russia in the Belgorod region on the Ukrainian border are at risk of shelling.\n\nShe added \"people are scared to death in Russia\" after the so-called partial mobilization and after decreeing martial law in Ukraine.\n\nThe war is \"getting closer and closer to Russians,\" she said.\n\n\"People now are acknowledging they are understanding that this war is coming to their homes,\" she said.\n\nKotrikadze added Putin has a tough choice to make on how to continue with \"his mobilization, this martial law, all the problems that Russian regions, Russian regions are going through right now.\"\n\nUkraine war is having an impact 'closer to home' To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nPeople of Ukraine win EU rights award\n\nEuropean lawmakers have awarded the Sakharov Prize For Freedom of Thought to the Ukrainian people.\n\n\"This award is for those Ukrainians fighting on the ground, for those who have been forced to flee, for those who have lost relatives and friends, for all those who stand up and fight for who and what they believe in,\" said European Parliament president Roberta Metsola.\n\nThe award comes with prize money of 50,000 ($49,100), which the EU said would be distributed to representatives of Ukrainian civil society.\n\nGerman President postpones Ukraine trip\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has called off a planned visit to Kyiv for security reasons, according to his office. Steinmeier was due to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.\n\nHis office said security authorities in Germany and the Foreign Ministry had advised Steinmeier not to go. However, the visit is expected to be rescheduled soon.\n\nE U draws up sanctions on Iran over Russia drones\n\nEuropean Union member state governments have provisionally agreed sanctions against eight people and entities over the use of Iranian-made unmanned aircraft in Russian strikes on Ukraine, according to diplomatic sources.\n\nSanctions experts from the 27 EU members agreed to the list in a meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\"Now that we have gathered our own sufficient evidence work is ongoing in the [European] Council in view of a clear, swift and firm EU response,\" said Nabila Massrali, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.\n\nOne diplomat said the list would likely be completed in time for a meeting of European leaders, to start late on Thursday.\n\nUkraine urged sanctions against Iran on Monday, haiving accused Tehran for weeks of supplying Russia with Shahed-136 drones.\n\nEU chief says infrastructure strikes are 'war crimes'\n\nThe head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has called Russian strikes targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine \"war crimes.\"\n\nVon der Leyen told members of the European Parliament the attacks had the clear aim of depriving people of electricity and water in the winter months.\n\n\"Yesterday we saw again Russia's targeted attacks against civilian infrastructure, and this is marking a new chapter in an already very cruel war,\" von der Leyen told members of the parliament in Strasbourg.\n\nThe president of the European Commission also reiterated the European Union's support for Ukraine \"for as long as it takes.\"\n\nRussia on Monday launched dozens of unmanned aerial vehicles on Ukraine that hit infrastructure, killing five people in the capital Kyiv.\n\nUkraine says the kamikaze drones are Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack craft that cruise towards their target before dropping at velocity and detonating on impact. Missiles have also been used to damage Ukraine's critical infrastructure in the past nine days.\n\nMoscow has focused particularly on attacking Ukraine's infrastructure grid, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying some 30% of the country's power plants have been destroyed.\n\nDrones show Moscow is 'militarily bankrupt'\n\nRussia's dependence on Iranian-made drones to attack Ukrainian targets exposes Moscow as \"bankrupt\" both politically and militarily, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday.\n\nUsing Iranian weaponry amounted to an acknowledgment of failure by the Kremlin, he added.\n\n\"For decades, they spent billions of dollars on their own military-industrial complex. And in the end, they bowed down to Tehran in order to secure quite simple drones and missiles,\" Zelenskyy said in a nightly video address.\n\nUkraine says Russia's latest attacks on infrastructure have relied on the Iranian-made drones. Iran denies supplying unmanned aerial vehicles to Russia.\n\nIn his address, Zelenskyy also thanked everyone who helps Ukraine with anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. According to the president, the German \"IRIS-T\" has shown itself as \"a really effective system.\"\n\n\"We are working with partners to provide even more protection to the Ukrainian sky,\" Zelenskyy added.\n\nRussian commander admits situation for his troops is 'tense'\n\nThe new Russian military commander for Ukraine operations said that Russia's army is preparing to evacuate civilians from the Kherson region.\n\n\"The Russian army will above all ensure the safe evacuation of the population\" of Kherson, General Sergey Surovikin told Russian state television,\n\nSurovikin, who has been in the job for the past 10 days, added the combat situation there was \"very tense.\"\n\n\"The enemy is not abandoning its attempts to attack Russian troop positions,\" he added, in a rare admission of the pressures being felt by his forces.\n\nGermany sends further military support to Ukraine\n\nThe government revealed on Tuesday that it had supplied Ukraine with five more armored recovery vehicles. That doubles the total amount sent by Germany.\n\nBerlin also delivered seven bridge systems to enable the crossing of rivers.\n\nAs well as more ammunition, Germany has also sent winter clothing, power generators and first aid kits.\n\nUS and allies to raise Iranian drone transfers to Russia at UN\n\nThe United States, Britain and France plan to raise alleged Iranian arms transfers to Russia at a closed-door UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday, diplomats said, after Ukraine said Russia's having obtained drones violated a Council resolution.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the diplomats said the three - which also believe such transfers violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231 - told their Council counterparts they would ask a UN official to brief members on the issue.\n\nRussia launched dozens of \"kamikaze\" drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on Ukraine on Monday, hitting energy infrastructure and killing five people in the capital Kyiv. Ukraine says they are Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack drones.\n\nMore from DW's coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nSuicide drones are said to have been used to attack the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Tehran has denied supplying Moscow with the equipment. What do we know about drone imports?\n\nAfter the rockets comes the propaganda pro-Russian voices have claimed that wounded people in Kyiv were just actors staging their suffering. But a DW fact check shows that the victims are real.\n\nlo,rc,dh,es/rt,rs,wmr (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",

He said it was being created in response to Ukraine plotting an attack on its ex-Soviet neighbor in the north. Lukashenko didnt provide any evidence to back up his claim.\n\nMoscow has used Belarus as a staging ground for its full-scale invasion and regular rocket attacks, but Belarusian troops have not been directly involved in Russias war effort in Ukraine.\n\nLukashenkos statements stoked fears that the joint force would attack Ukraine from the north, aiming to disrupt corridors used to transport Western-supplied weapons across the country.\n\nBelarusian military officials, however, insisted that the force was being created for defensive purposes only.\n\nAs Russian soldiers were deploying in Belarus, Belarusian authorities arrested at least four activists they accused of plotting terrorist attacks to sabotage the operation.\n\n11:50 a.m.:\n\n11:35 a.m.: The United States and Britain will further their cooperation on sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine as well as on other targets, top financial officials for the two allied nations said in a joint statement on Monday, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Over time, we expect to realize the benefits of our collaboration not only in relation to the sanctions imposed in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine, but also across other common sanctions regimes,\" Andrea Gacki, the head of the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, and Giles Thomson, the head of Britain's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, wrote.\n\n11:20 a.m.:\n\n11:05 a.m.: A top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is blaming Iran for the death of Ukrainians in Russian drone strikes, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMikhailo Podolyak also warned that sanctions may not be enough to deter Tehran from supplying Moscows forces with the deadly suicide drones that killed at least four civilians in Kyiv on Monday.\n\n\"A country that oppresses its own people is now giving (Russian) monsters weapons for mass murders in the heart of Europe,\" Mikhailo Podolyak tweeted.\n\nHe said there could be no \"concessions to totalitarianism.\"\n\nPodolyak also called for the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations to expel Russia from the organization.\n\n10:55 a.m.:\n\n10:40 a.m.: European Union countries generally agree that sanctions should be imposed on Iran if investigation proves the country provided Russia with drones used in attacks in Ukraine, the Polish foreign minister said on Monday after meeting his counterparts in Brussels, according to Reuters.\n\nEarlier Monday, the EUs top diplomat said the bloc is seeking concrete evidence for any Iranian involvement in Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\n\"We will look for concrete evidence about the participation (of Iran in the Ukraine war),\" Josep Borrell told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, adding Ukraine's Dmytro Kuleba would take part in the gathering.\n\nUkraine has reported a spate of Russian attacks with Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in recent weeks.

She is not picking up the phone,\" Mazur said.\n\nHours earlier, residents of several Ukrainian cities had scrambled for cover for the second time in a week as Russia launched attacks with drones and missiles, striking residential areas and energy infrastructure.\n\nFour people, including a woman who was six months pregnant and her partner, were killed when a \"kamikaze\" drone hit a block of flats on the edge of Kyiv's central Shevchenkivskyi district, the city mayor said.\n\n9:50 a.m.:\n\n9:35 a.m.: Ukraines capital is reeling from a Russian barrage of suicide drones packed with explosives, which killed at least three people, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe blasts set fire to Kyiv buildings and sent people scurrying to air raid shelters. Some tried to shoot down the kamikazes.\n\nOne of the drones slammed into a residential building, killing three people, according to the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidents office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko.\n\nEnergy facilities were also targeted as Moscow tries to disrupt Ukraines heating supply as winter approaches.\n\nThe Russian military said they used \"long-range air and sea-based high precision weapons\" to strike Ukraines military and energy facilities.\n\nThe attack came a week after Russia unleashed its most widespread strikes against the country in months and as Moscow struggles to halt a Ukrainian battlefield counteroffensive.\n\nKyivs daily life soon resumed in a city that has become grimly accustomed to attacks.\n\n9:25 a.m.:\n\n9:10 a.m.: President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has set Russia on a path towards turmoil that could unseat the Kremlin chief, trigger civil war or even break the country apart, said a Russian diplomat who resigned over the war, Reuters reported.\n\nBoris Bondarev, a counsellor at Russia's permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva, resigned in May because he felt the war had shown just how repressive and warped his homeland had become.\n\nIn a 6,500 word critique of Putin's Russia, Bondarev said the state was infested by sycophantic \"yes men\" who repeated the Kremlin's line, allowing Putin to make crucial decisions in an echo chamber of his own propaganda.\n\nThe future could be laced with chaos, he said.\n\n\"If Putin is kicked out of office, Russias future will be deeply uncertain,\" Bondarev, who worked at the foreign ministry from 2002 to 2022, said in an essay in Foreign Affairs.\n\n8:50 a.m.:\n\n8:40 a.m.: The European Union on Monday approved a military training mission in Europe for thousands of Ukrainian troops and a plan to provide around 500 million euros ($486 million) in extra funds to help buy weapons for the war-torn country, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe mission, which will have a headquarters in Brussels and be under the command of French naval officer Vice Adm. Herve Blejean, will initially run for two years with a budget of almost 107 million euros ($104 million).\n\nEU headquarters said in a statement that the missions aim is to allow the Ukrainian armed forces to \"effectively conduct military operations,\" so that Ukraine can \"defend its territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, effectively exercise its sovereignty and protect civilians.\"\n\nIt said that the EU will provide \"individual, collective and specialized training.\" Countries that arent part of the bloc will be allowed to take part in the training effort. The aim initially is to train about 15,000 Ukrainian troops, chiefly in Poland and Germany.\n\nIts hoped that the mission will be up and running by mid-November.\n\nSeveral EU and NATO nations are already training Ukraines armed forces on a bilateral basis.

Security Council finds \"more agile and effective ways of resolving conflicts.\"\n\n\"In wartime, it is essential to affirm that we need more multilateralism and a better multilateralism,\" but the U.N. is no longer fit for \"new realities,\" he added in an extract published by La Stampa daily.\n\nThe organization was founded to prevent the horrors of two World Wars from happening again, but although the threat represented by those conflicts was still alive, \"today's world is no longer the same,\" said Francis.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

REUTERS/Vladyslav Musiienko/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The United States, Britain and France plan to raise alleged Iranian arms transfers to Russia at a closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting on Wednesday, diplomats said, after Kyiv accused Moscow of using Iranian-origin drones against civilian targets.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine has invited U.N. experts to inspect what it says are downed Iranian-origin drones used by Russia to attack Ukrainian targets in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 that endorsed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, according to a letter seen by Reuters.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the diplomats said the three - which also believe such transfers violate the resolution - told their Council counterparts they would ask a U.N. official to brief members on the issue on Wednesday.\n\nRussia launched dozens of \"kamikaze\" drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), on Ukraine on Monday, hitting energy infrastructure and killing five people in the capital Kyiv.\n\nUkraine says they are Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack drones - loitering munitions that cruise towards their target before plummeting at velocity and detonating on impact. Kyiv moved on Tuesday to cut ties with Iran because of their use.\n\nTehran denies supplying the drones to Moscow, while Washington says Iran's denial is a lie.\n\nKremlin on Tuesday denied its forces had used Iranian drones to attack Ukraine. read more\n\nCiting current and former U.S. officials, the New York Times reported on Tuesday that Iran has sent trainers to occupied Ukraine to help Russians overcome problems with the fleet of drones that they purchased from Tehran.\n\nThe newspaper said the Iranian trainers are operating from a Russian military base in Crimea where many of the drones have been based since being delivered from Iran. It said the trainers are from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a part of Iran's military which Washington deems a terrorist organization.\n\nAsked about the report, a State Department spokesperson said: \"While we will not comment on purported intelligence leaks, we have been warning since July that Iran was planning to give weapons to Russia for use against Ukraine.\"\n\n\"There is abundant evidence that Iranian UAVs have been used to attack Ukrainian civilians and military targets, although Iran continues to lie shamelessly about its involvement,\" he added, saying the presence of Iranian trainers in Crimea \"would further implicate Iran in assisting Russia's unprovoked and brutal war, including attacks on Ukrainian civilians.\"\n\nTwo senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats told Reuters that Iran has promised to provide Russia with surface to surface missiles, in addition to more drones.\n\n\"We would like to invite U.N. experts to visit Ukraine at the earliest possible opportunity to inspect recovered Iranian-origin UAVs in order to facilitate implementation of U.N. Security Council resolution 2231,\" Ukraine's ambassador to United Nations said in a letter distributed to Council members on Tuesday.\n\nThe letter, dated Oct. 14, says in late August Shahed- and Mohajer-series drones were transferred to Russia in what Ukraine and major Western powers regard as a violation of resolution 2231, which endorsed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\n\nThe pact limited Tehran's nuclear program, making it harder for Tehran to develop atomic weapons, while easing economic sanctions.\n\nUnder the resolution, a conventional arms embargo on Iran was in place until October 2020. Despite U.S. efforts under former president Donald Trump, who took Washington out of the nuclear deal in 2018, to extend the arms embargo, the Security Council rejected this, allowing Iran to resume arms exports.\n\nHowever, Ukraine, along with the United States, argues the resolution still includes restrictions on missiles and related technologies until October 2023 and can encompass the export and purchase of advanced military systems such as drones.\n\nIn the letter, Ukraine said \"both Mohajer and Shahed UAVs meet the parameters\" stipulated under 2231 \"because they are capable of a range of equal to or greater than 300 kilometers (186 miles).\"\n\nReporting By Michelle Nichols in New York and by Arshad Mohammed in Washington; Editing by Grant McCool, Alistair Bell, Richard Pullin and Himani Sarkar\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "A deluge of extraordinary imagery from Ukraine shows exactly what its like when relatively unsophisticated kamikaze drones are thrown into battle en masse, striking population centers and critical infrastructure. Todays Russian drone attacks, using the Iranian-supplied Shahed-136, and perhaps others, have killed at least four people in Kyiv and hit other targets across the country. Desperate scenes show defenders, including soldiers and police officers, and apparently also civilians, taking aim at the incoming drones using assault rifles and other small arms.\n\nA police officer fires at a flying drone during attacks in Kyiv on October 17, 2022.

Many more had to be rescued from the rubble. According to Ukraines Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi, an undisclosed number of people have been killed in other cities, too.\n\nA man falls to the ground while another runs for cover during a drone attack in Kyiv on October 17, 2022. Photo by YASUYOSHI CHIBA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOther targets in Kyiv apparently included an operations center related to the citys heating network.\n\n\"All night and all morning the enemy terrorizes the civilian population,\" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the Telegram messaging app. \"Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine.\"\n\n\"The enemy can attack our cities, but it wont be able to break us,\" Zelensky added. \"The occupiers will get only fair punishment and condemnation of future generations. And we will get victory.\"\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense described the operation as a \"massive\" attack on military targets and energy infrastructure across Ukraine that involved the use of \"high-precision weapons,\" and Russia denied that civilians were targeted.\n\nThis is the second wave of major Russian strikes on Ukraine in the space of a week. Compared to last Mondays raid, however, which involved significant use of cruise and ballistic missiles, todays airstrikes appear to have been spearheaded by Shahed-136 drones, known to the Russian military as Geran-2.\n\nPhoto by SERGEI SUPINSKY/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMultiple photos and videos from Ukraine show the Shahed-136s carrying out their attacks today, which involve the drones flying a one-way mission to pre-planned coordinates, which they dive on and slam into before their explosive payload detonates. It seems the sheer numbers of these drones involved in the raids made their interception difficult, although they are by no means easy to counter at the best of times, despite their relatively low-end technology. They fly low and relatively slow and have small radar and infrared signatures, making them a challenge for even advanced air defense systems.\n\nNevertheless, Kyiv claims to have shot down 37 Russian drones since Sunday evening. Those numbers cannot be independently verified.\n\nThe mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said that 28 drones were directed against the capital itself, flying in successive waves, and that \"a total of five explosions were heard in Kyiv.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force claimed that 13 or more of the drones were shot down in the Kyiv region, all of them flying in from the south.\n\nOutside of Kyiv, known targets of the drone attacks included the Everi marine terminal in the southern city of Mykolaiv, late on Sunday. According to local officials, this damaged sunflower oil storage tanks and set some of them ablaze.\n\n\"This is an entirely civilian facility. There is no military,\" said Andriy, 47, a senior manager at the plant. He also condemned Russia for its attempt to \"destroy the economy and to destroy food security.\"\n\nThere have also been suggestions that todays attacks are, at least in part, intended in revenge for Ukraine apparently having hit Russian targets within the Belgorod region, close to the Ukrainian border. You can read more about that here. The wreckage of one of the drones used today appeared to carry the words: \"For Belgorod.\"\n\nDespite all the footage and images of the Iranian drones' use in Ukraine, as well as intelligence dating back to early summer, Iran has continued to deny that its supplied them to Russia. In the face of Tehrans protestations, a number of European Union foreign ministers have called for a new round of sanctions against Iran for its support for the Russian war effort provided there is concrete evidence of Iranian involvement. Even if Russia were already building Shahed-136 drones itself, its inconceivable that it would be able to do this absent Iranian support and approval.\n\nRegardless, just as we predicted, there are many reports now that Russia is buying thousands more of the drones and possibly other similar types from Iran. Isreal, which is supposedly sharing intelligence with Ukraine on these systems but will not supply weapons to Kyiv, would undoubtedly be taking a high interest in these developments. In particular, assessing how the influx of cash and whatever else Russia is providing in exchange for these capabilities, as well as speeding up the evolution of their standoff weapons technology, would impact its national security.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak took to Twitter to write: \"Iran is responsible for the murders of Ukrainians. Country that oppresses its own people is now giving ru-monsters [Russians] weapons for mass murders in the heart of Europe.\"\n\nCondemnation of Russia from the international community has also been swift. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv described the drone attacks as \"desperate and reprehensible.\"\n\nUkrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat admitted that the swarms of kamikaze drones posed a particular difficulty for the countrys air defenses, which have only very recently begun to receive more modern Western equipment. Video footage from Kyiv appeared to show at least one shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile being fired, ineffectively, against one of the drones.\n\n\"The challenges are serious because the air defense forces and means are the same as they were at the beginning of the war,\" Ihnat said.\n\nWhile the Shahed-136 is bigger and faster than many of the small commercial drones being used in the conflict, with a fairly substantial warhead and big standoff range, its relatively low cost (reportedly around $10,000 to $20,000 apiece) means its a significant cost-exchange mismatch to use surface-to-air missiles or even fighter jets firing missiles to defeat them. This is an issue that has affected Saudi Arabia, in particular, as it tackles Houthi drones (and cruise missiles). For instance, each new AIM-120 AMRAAM built today, the same type used in NASAMS air defense system Ukraine is getting, cost $1M. Luckily, NATO has a lot AIM-120s in its arsenal because Ukraine will likely be gobbling them up soon.\n\nMeanwhile, there are now increasing numbers of reports suggesting that Iranian-made ballistic missiles may also be headed to Russia, something that we had predicted could make a lot of sense for Russia. An equally proven set of weapons for this level of strikes, missiles like the Iranian Fateh-110 would be similarly useful for attacking static Ukrainian targets, whether military or civilian. You can read out full report on this here.\n\nCombined with the very visible threat posed by the Shahed-136s, this will surely result in further calls to bolster Ukraines air defenses against these and other threats.",

                "cc_text": "Concerned about the movement of Russian troops and equipment to Belarus and the continued launching of 'kamikaze drones' from that nation, Ukraine is bolstering its forces along its northern border with Moscows client state.\n\n\"We have already grown our grouping in the north direction,\" said Brig. Gen. Eral Alexey Gromov, Deputy Chief of the Chief Operational Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Thursday. Unable to succeed in the south and east, Russia may be looking for a new front, he added. The opening phases of Russias full-on invasion, which began back on February 24, included an unsuccessful push from Belarus toward the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\nIn keeping with the Ukrainian militarys position of maintaining strict operational security, Gromov did not offer any details on how many troops, exactly where they are, or how they are equipped. He did outline several reasons behind the troop increase along the border with Belarus.\n\nAt the moment, Ukraine does not see \"the direct creation of an offensive group\" of Russian forces in Belarus, Gromov said during an online briefing of representatives of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine at the Military Media Center Thursday, according to the Ukrainian General Staff Facebook page. But they are gearing up efforts there, he said.\n\n\"Measures are purposefully carried out by\" Russia, Gromov said, pointing to \"the territory of the Chornobyl zone, as well as from the Chernihiv region. \"Threats are [there], threats will be [there], we respond to everything accordingly.\"\n\nRussian officers are taking part \"in the assessment of the readiness of the military units of [the] Grodnetsk, Brest, and Gomel regions of Belarus,\" said Gromov. In addition to transferring troops to the Zyabrivka airport, Russians are still trying to transfer troops to other airports in Belarus, he said.\n\nAnd Russia continues to use Belarus to mount drone attacks on Ukraine.\n\n\"This week, 10 Shahed drone launches were carried out from the territory of the Republic of Belarus,\" he said.\n\nAnd while there have been reports of Iranian troops spotted in Ukraine to help Russian forces operate those drones, some have apparently recently shown up in Belarus as well.\n\nPrevious estimates have placed about 10,000 Russian troops in Belarus.\n\nThose troops began arriving after Oct. 10, when Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to deploy a regional group of forces of troops from both nations in Belarus. Lukashenko called the deployment a response to NATO provocations on the border, the formation of sabotage units staffed by Belarusian migrs, and Ukrainian plans to attack Belarus. But it should be noted that prior to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia had troops in Belarus as part of a massive training exercises.\n\nRussian and Belarusian armed forces take part in Allied Determination-2022 military drill in Gomel, Belarus on Feb. 19, 2022, five days before Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine. (Photo by Stringer/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nGromov said that while Belarusian military maneuvers and public statements point to \"a lack of intention to attack Ukraine,\" ongoing \"meetings of the military-political leadership of Belarus with representatives of labor teams form the image of the enemy with the need for preventive actions against Ukraine and NATO.\"\n\n\"We respond adequately to all threats not only from the territory of the Republic of Belarus,\" he said, \"but from the east of our country, and from the south.\"\n\nBefore diving into the most recent details of the war, catch up on our previous rolling coverage here.\n\nThe Latest\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky today told an Italian newspaper that Russia is not planning a quick retreat from the key port city of Kherson. His comments come on the heels of a similar sentiment expressed by Ukrainian Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the countrys Defense Intelligence directorate, as we previously reported here.\n\n\"I dont see that they are running out of the Kherson I think that is an informational attack,\" he told Corriere della Sera, according to CNN. \"For us, I dont want to say all the secrets, for us to come there, to take more people from some dangerous places and to go there. I think it was their information attack. So, they are not ready to go out of Kherson. But they know that if we will have success, they will not have [the] possibility to exit.\"\n\nElsewhere on the battlefield, Russia continues to mount ground attacks in the Donetsk Oblast while Ukraine has made counteroffensive attacks in the Luhansk Oblast, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank's latest assessment.\n\nISW offered some key takeaways:\n\nRussian occupation officials in Kherson Oblast are attempting to mitigate the informational consequences of the Russian withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nRussian forces are attempting to fix Ukrainian forces on Ukraines northern border.\n\nRussian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted counteroffensive operations west of Svatove, in the Luhansk Oblast.\n\nRussian forces continued to prepare defensive positions on the west and east banks of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast.\n\nRussian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces continued to conduct counteroffensive operations in northwest Kherson Oblast.\n\nRussian forces conducted ground attacks in Donetsk Oblast.\n\nRussian occupation officials in Kherson Oblast continued to relocate residents from the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's \"rasputitsa,\" the rainy season that turns much of the terrain into gooey mud, may be starting to play a role in battlefield operations.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin today delivered a speech at a foreign policy conference in Moscow, hitting on several familiar themes like blaming the U.S. and its allies for the war in Ukraine, for provoking tensions in China, and even for creating the global food crisis.\n\nAnd despite repeated threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and claiming without evidence that the country is working to create a dirty bomb, Putin said a Russian nuclear strike \"would make no political, military sense,\" state news agency RIA Novosti reported on its Telegram channel. Putin also clarified his previous remarks on the subject, saying they were in response to western threats.\n\nPutin's comments about nuclear weapons came on the same day that the Pentagon released an unclassified version of its National Defense Strategy (NDS) document, outlining how the U.S. plans to defend itself in the future.\n\nUkraine is mentioned 13 times in that document, which directly addresses Putin's nuclear saber-rattling and Russia's invasion.\n\n\"The Russian Federations unprovoked and unlawful invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is a stark reminder of nuclear risk in contemporary conflict,\" according to the document. \"Russia has conducted its aggression against Ukraine under a nuclear shadow characterized by irresponsible saber-rattling, out of cycle nuclear exercises, and false narratives concerning the potential use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). In brandishing Russias nuclear arsenal in an attempt to intimidate Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Russias leaders have made clear that they view these weapons as a shield behind which to wage unjustified aggression against their neighbors.\"\n\nDuring a press briefing to talk about the NDS, Austin said he saw no indication that either Russia or Ukraine are planning on using a dirty bomb, and said he did not believe that Russia's annual Grom nuclear weapons exercise was serving as a \"cover activity\" for a nuclear attack on Ukraine.\n\nWhile Putin may be walking back nuclear threats, a Russian official today repeated Moscow's warnings that it might strike at communications satellites over Ukraine.\n\nKonstantin Vorontsov, deputy head of the Russian delegation to the UN, said on Thursday that U.S. commercial satellites used in Ukraine \"for military purposes\" could be a \"legitimate target\" for Russian strikes according to Israel's I24 News organization. He accused the United States and its allies of \"using civil infrastructure in space\" for military purposes.\n\nVorontsov appeared to be referring to the Starlink terminals supplied to Ukraine by Elon Musks SpaceX since the first days of the Russian invasion. We covered the controversy over Musk asking for, then rescinding a request, for the Pentagon to pay for the use of the system in Ukraine here.\n\nWith tens of billions of dollars of weaponry flowing into Ukraine from the U.S. and its allies, there are growing concerns about those weapons falling into the wrong hands as they have in so many previous conflicts around the world.\n\nReacting to those concerns, the U.S. State Department on Thursday unveiled a new plan to monitor the use of those arms to prevent that from happening.\n\nThe \"U.S. Plan to Counter Illicit Diversion of Certain Advanced Conventional Weapons in Eastern Europe\" is designed, according to State Department spokesman Ned Price, to further:\n\nSafeguard and account for arms and munitions in Ukraine and neighboring countries when they are transferred, stored, and deployed\n\nEnhance regional border management and security\n\nBuild capacity of security forces, law enforcement, and border control agencies in the region to deter, detect, and interdict illicit arms trafficking\n\nSo far, intense internal demand for use on the battlefield by Ukrainian military and security forces within Ukraine \"is assessed to be impeding black-market proliferation of small arms and guided infantry weapons such as man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM)s from Ukraine,\" according to the report. \"Pro-Russian forces capture of Ukrainian weapons including donated materiel has been the main vector of diversion so far and could result in onward transfers. Russia probably will also use these weapons to develop countermeasures, propaganda, or to conduct false-flag operations.\"\n\nPeople hold used anti-tank and anti-aircraft military equipment such as Javelin, NLAW, Stinger and other, which were used by Ukrainian military in the fights with the Russian army, and are displayed in an outdoor exhibition in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Aug. 12. (Photo by Yuriy Dyachyshyn / AFP) (Photo by YURIY DYACHYSHYN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWars, however, \"can provide opportunities for weapons to fall into private hands via theft or illicit sales, sometimes creating black markets for arms that endure for decades. A variety of criminal and non-state actors may attempt to acquire weapons from sources in Ukraine during or following the conflict, as occurred after the Balkans Wars in the 1990s.\"\n\nAccording to the plan, the U.S., \"whenever practicable\" will \"cooperate closely with Allies and key partners to mitigate the risk of potential weapons diversion due to Russias destabilizing actions.\"\n\nMore immediately, however, Ukraine has to worry about its power infrastructure, with constant Russian attacks ahead of what is typically a long and frigid winter. A map posted on the Russian Rybar Telegram channel, and shared by author Chris Owen, show just how widespread those attacks may have been.\n\nThose attacks are having cascading effects, including increasing power outages in the Kyiv region.\n\nAttacking energy supplies has long been a staple of war and Ukraine is hitting back, attacking Russian fuel supplies, like this attack on an oil depot in the occupied town of Shakktarsk in eastern Donetsk.\n\nUkrainians also apparently hit the nearby rail yard as well.\n\nDonated equipment continues to flow into Ukraine and get spotted on the battlefield, like this French VAB armored personnel carrier.\n\nOf course, some of the donated equipment inevitably gets destroyed or damaged, like this Iveco LAV3 infantry fighting vehicle, one of 14 donated by Norway and spotted for the first time in Ukraine, according to the Ukraine Weapons Tracker OSINT group.\n\nEquipment is not the only assistance Ukraine is receiving. Foreigners are also helping Ukrainian troops learn the basics of warfare, like clearing trenches.\n\nEight months into defending against Russia's all-out invasion, Ukraine continues to innovate on the battlefield.\n\nToday, Ukraine introduced its newest drone, called \"SHARK,\" designed largely as a reconnaissance spotting device for Ukrainian artillery units. Developed by the Ukrainian company Ukrspetssistem, SHARK is resistant to electronic warfare attacks, according to the official Ukrainian STRATCOM Telegram channel, but no specific details were provided.\n\nBut as badly as Ukraine has been attacked, it is also rebuilding, even as missiles and drones continue to strike. An apartment building in Kyiv that was famously hit by a Russian missile on the third day of the war is now being renovated by residents.\n\nMany of the ongoing drone attacks have been blunted by Ukrainian air defenses. Zelensky was seen standing over an Iranian-provided Russian Shahed-131 loitering munition that did not carry out its intended mission.\n\nUkraine continues to wreak havoc on Russian forces, in one case a group of its Special Operations Center snipers taking out a Russian assault group.\n\nAnd in Bakhmut, a Russian BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle was destroyed.\n\nBakhmut continues to be a bloody slog for both sides. An asphalt plant there has been a key battleground that has apparently changed hands several times.\n\nRussia meanwhile continues to struggle with its large-scale mobilization of hundreds of thousands of draftees called up to fight in Ukraine.\n\nNearly a third of Moscow officials in the mayor's office have reportedly fled, part of a mass exodus of those wanting nothing to do with being mobilized.\n\nThings are so bad that the commander of the Russian Army Group Central reportedly used a pistol to threaten the commander of a mobilized unit from retreating.\n\nBut throughout this conflict, perhaps no weapon has captured the imagination like the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS.\n\nIt has become so iconic that one Virginia motorist took the time and money to slap the acronym on a vanity plate.\n\nWe will update this story until we state otherwise.",

                "cc_text": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.\n\nRussias General Sergei Surovikin is no stranger to mass murder and spreading terror.\n\nIn Chechnya, the shaven-headed veteran officer, who has the physique of a wrestler and an expression to match, vowed to \"destroy three Chechen fighters for every Russian soldier killed.\" And hes remembered bitterly in northern Syria for reducing much of the city of Aleppo to ruins.\n\nThe 56-year-old air force general also oversaw the relentless targeting of clinics, hospitals and civilian infrastructure in rebel-held Idlib in 2019, an effort to break opponents will and send refugees fleeing to Europe via neighboring Turkey. The 11-month campaign \"showed callous disregard for the lives of the roughly 3 million civilians in the area,\" noted Human Rights Watch in a scathing report.\n\nNow he is repeating his Syrian playbook in Ukraine.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Vladimir Putin appointed Surovikin as the overall commander of Russias so-called special military operation, to the delight of Moscows hawks. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov praised Surovikin as \"a real general and a warrior.\" He will \"improve the situation,\" Kadyrov added in a social media post.\n\nBut reversing a series of stunning battlefield Ukrainian victories and shifting the tide of the war may be beyond even the ruthless Surovikin. Ukrainians have shown throughout the year theyre made of stern stuff and arent going to be intimidated by war crimes and theyve endured bombing and bombardments before by equally unscrupulous Russian generals.\n\nBut Western military officials and analysts note there are already signs of more tactical coherence than was seen under his predecessor General Alexander Dvornikov. \"His war tactics totally breach the rules of war but unfortunately they proved effective in Syria,\" a senior British military intelligence officer told POLITICO. \"As a war strategist he has a record of effectiveness however vicious,\" the officer added.\n\nSurovikin and other officials point to the targeting of Ukraines energy infrastructure with a massive wave of attacks the past week. Strikes at the weekend resulted in power outages across the country leaving more than a million households without electricity, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidency, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said Saturday.\n\n\"These are vile strikes on critical objects,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. \"The world can and must stop this terror,\" he said. \"The geography of this latest mass strike is very wide,\" Zelenskyy added. \"Of course we dont have the technical ability to knock down 100 percent of the Russian missiles and strike drones. I am sure that, gradually, we will achieve that, with help from our partners. Already now, we are downing a majority of cruise missiles, a majority of drones.\"\n\nIntercepting a majority of whats being fired by the Russians at Ukraines energy infrastructure, though, isnt enough to halt the disruption Surovikin is endeavoring to provoke with the strikes. The scale of the damage caused to Ukraines power system at the weekend exceeded what was inflicted in the first wave of strikes on energy infrastructure on October 10, according to a Telegram post by Ukrenergo, the state grid operator.\n\nCheap shots\n\nAround a third of the countrys power stations have been destroyed since the attacks started, Ukrainian authorities say.\n\nAnd for Russia the cost of the aerial assault is cheap, relying as it does on Irans Shahed-136 unmanned aerial vehicles, basically flying bombs nicknamed \"kamikaze drones\" because they are destroyed on impact.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin with then-PM Dmitry Medvedev and Sergei Surovikin in 2017 | Pool photo by Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe drones, which have a flying range of 2,500 kilometers, loiter over a target until ordered to attack. With a wingspan of 2.5 meters they can be difficult to identify on radar and cost only an estimated 20,000 to make, compared, say, to cruise missiles costing up to 2 million to produce.\n\nLast week the White House said Iranian drone experts trainers and tech support workers have been deployed on the ground in Russia-annexed Crimea to help launch attacks on Ukraine. \"Tehran is now directly engaged on the ground, and through the provision of weapons that are impacting civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine,\" said national security spokesman John Kirby.\n\nBut turning to Iran for assistance also demonstrates a Russian weakness, says a Pentagon adviser. That they are using Iranian drones suggests they really are running out of missiles. \"I dont think their capabilities are anyway as good as they claim. Ive always thought that the Russians were a bit of a hollow force. They dont have depth in range with capabilities and they cant really apply them very effectively. The fact that theyre going to Iranians for drone technology, thats a pretty sad statement about the once vaunted Russian military-industrial or Soviet military-industrial complex,\" the adviser told POLITICO.\n\nAnd while the drones are helping to cause considerable damage, their light explosive payloads at 36 kilograms present the Russians with a problem they are not powerful enough to cause \"decommissioning\" damage to big power stations and so are being aimed at smaller sub-stations instead. Eventually, too, Western and Ukrainian experts will find ways to jam the GPS system the drones depend on to shift them off target. So, they may have a short shelf life of effectiveness, say Western officials.\n\nNot having sufficient depth in terms of capabilities isnt the only problem facing Russian generals. One of the most debilitating problems for the Russians has been the lack of small-unit leadership and competent supervision on the battlefield.\n\nUkrainian servicemen and police officers stand guard in a street after a drone attack in Kyiv on October 17, 2022 | Sergei Supinsky/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Ukrainians since 2014 have been steeped in U.S. military doctrine and training, which focuses on building a professional corps of corporals and sergeants who understand the big picture and are given the delegated authority to make decisions on the battlefield as they lead their units, according to John Barranco, an analyst at the Atlantic Council who oversaw the U.S. Marines initial operations in Afghanistan after the 9/11 terror attacks and served in Iraq.\n\nThe failure of the Russians to build up such a cadre has plagued them in Ukraine and it isnt a deficiency Surovikin has time to rectify. In fact, the situation is likely to worsen with the Kremlin now throwing into inadequately battle-trained conscripts from Putins partial mobilization order.\n\nRussian retreat\n\nAfter just a handful of days training, conscripts are already dying. And draftees are being sent to what is now the crucial front in this stage of the war the southern port city of Kherson where Russian authorities have ordered all residents to leave ahead of a closing advance by Ukrainian troops.\n\nKherson city is the only regional capital Russia has managed to seize since the invasion began. It was a key prize in establishing a land bridge between Crimea and Ukraines south, as well as opening the way for a potential assault on the major Black Sea port of Odesa.\n\nBut a Ukrainian counteroffensive that started in the summer is now bearing down on Kherson city. Russias tactical position in the area is highly compromised, with units of paratroopers dug in on the west bank of the Dnieper River, where they are highly vulnerable. \"From a battlefield geometry point of view, it is a terrible position for the Russians,\" Jack Watling, a land warfare expert at Britains Royal United Services Institute, told POLITICO.\n\nWatling, whos been conducting operational analysis with Ukraines general staff, says the Russians on the west bank are among their most capable troops but cant be resupplied reliably \"at the scale needed to make them competitive\" and they wont be able to counterattack.\n\n\"The Ukrainians have the initiative and can dictate the tempo,\" Watling said. \"From a purely military point of view, the Russians would be much better off withdrawing from Kherson city and focusing on holding the river [from the east bank] and then putting the bulk of their forces on the Zaporizhzhia axis, but for political reasons they have been slow to do that and seem to ready to fight a delaying action.\"\n\nA view taken on October 19, 2022 shows a road sign reading \"Kherson\" in the town of Armyansk in the north of Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula bordering the Russian-controlled Kherson region in southern Ukraine | AFP via Getty Images\n\nThat seems in line with what Ukraines general staff reported at the weekend. Russian troop movements have been occurring in the Kherson region with some units preparing for urban combat, while others have been withdrawing.\n\nIn short, Surovikin is being forced to try to pull off one of the most difficult of military maneuvers an orderly retreat to reposition forces, including draftees with scant training and units that have no cohesion. When more experienced Russian troops tried the same move near Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine last month, they suffered a rout.\n\nThuggery alone wont save Russian conscripts from motivated and agile Ukrainian forces. Whether Surovikin has the tactical skills to navigate a dangerous retreat will be what counts.",

Ukraine has not commented.\n\nWithout providing evidence, Russia accused British troops of being involved in Saturday's attack - and in blowing up gas pipelines last month.\n\nIn its response, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia was \"peddling false claims of an epic scale\".\n\nRussia said the ships targeted in Saturday's attack were involved in the internationally-brokered deal to allow grain exports from Ukrainian ports and hours later announced that it was suspending its participation in it.\n\nThe attack comes as Ukrainian troops successfully retake territory occupied by Russian troops since they launched their invasion on 24 February.\n\nRussia has replied by launching large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly on the country's energy grid.\n\nCrimea was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and is extremely symbolic for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn recent weeks, several attacks have hit the peninsula, where the Russian army has built up a large presence.\n\nSevastopol is the largest city in the region and home to Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-installed governor of the city, said Russia's navy had repelled the latest attack - the \"most massive\" on the city since February.\n\nHe said that all unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) had been shot down and no \"civilian infrastructure\" had been damaged.\n\nAt least one vessel sustained minor damage, the Russian ministry of defence said.\n\n\"In the course of repelling a terrorist attack on the outer roadstead of Sevastopol, the use of naval weapons and naval aviation of the Black Sea Fleet destroyed four marine unmanned vehicles, three more devices were destroyed on the internal roadstead,\" a statement from the ministry read.\n\nThe Ukrainian government rarely comments on claims made by Russian authorities in Crimea, although senior officials often celebrate incidents in the peninsula.\n\nUkraine has vowed to recapture all territory that is under Russian occupation, including Crimea, which has been a key base for President Putin's forces during the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWithout providing any evidence, the Russian defence ministry also accused British navy specialists of helping Ukrainian forces prepare the attack on Saturday morning.\n\nIt also said the same unit was \"involved in plotting, organising, and implementation of the terrorist attack in the Baltic Sea on 26 September this year to blow up the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines\".\n\nIn its reply, the MoD said: \"To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.\n\n\"This invented story, says more about arguments going on inside the Russian Government than it does about the west.\"\n\nIn recent days, Russia has been engaged in what US and Ukrainian officials describe as a disinformation campaign, with unsubstantiated claims that Kyiv is preparing to use a radioactive dirty bomb, or even biological mosquitoes.\n\nRussia has also claimed that the ships targeted on Saturday morning were involved in ensuring the \"grain corridor\" as part of the international initiative to export agricultural products from Ukrainian ports.\n\nThe agreement, brokered by the UN and Turkey, allowed Ukraine to resume its Black Sea grain exports, which had been blocked when Russia invaded the country. It was personally negotiated by the UN secretary general and celebrated as a major diplomatic victory that helped ease a global food crisis.\n\nBut Russia complains that its own exports are still hindered, and had previously suggested it might not renew the deal.\n\nIn recent days, Kyiv has accused Moscow of deliberately delaying the passage of ships, creating a queue of more than 170 vessels.\n\nRussia's Black Sea Fleet was previously targeted in April this year by Ukrainian forces when its flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk. The 510-crew missile cruiser had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, and its sinking was a major symbolic and military blow.\n\nEarlier this month, a blast occurred on the Crimean bridge - a pivotal symbol of Russia's annexation of Crimea.",

                "cc_text": "How to support Ukraine over the long winter was a main topic of discussion at the conference, which brought defense ministers and military leaders from 50 countries together to discuss next steps in the war effort. On Tuesday, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace flew to Washington on an unannounced, one-day trip to huddle with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and White House staff, and a senior U.K. defense official said the coming winter fight was on the agenda.\n\nEven with the remarkable gains made by Ukrainian troops since August, in which they recaptured vast swaths of the east and south, there is little sense among allies that the fighting is anywhere near its conclusion.\n\nInstead, many NATO officials see the campaign entering a slower but no less bloody phase, as entrenched forces launch artillery, rocket and drone attacks to unseat and unnerve the other. Meanwhile Kyiv will scramble to keep the power and the heat pumping amid Russian missile barrages clearly meant to terrorize the civilian population.\n\nWinter fighting can be exceptionally difficult, but holding frozen ground for days or weeks on end can also sap the will of a fighting force particularly an occupying army another NATO official in Brussels told reporters. \"If youre fighting in those conditions, if your tank is always getting stuck, if it is always throwing a track and youre constantly cold and wet, it affects what we would call the moral component of an army,\" the official said.\n\nUkrainian troops will struggle under the same conditions, but they have the motivation of fighting for their own homes, as well as a reliable pipeline of new equipment being supplied by Western partners. Several NATO countries have started rushing winter equipment to Ukraine already. This month, Canada announced $15 million worth of winter clothing donations, including 500,000 parkas, pants, boots and gloves pulled from military stocks as well as purchased from Canadian companies.\n\nEstonia also provided two brigades worth of winter clothing. The countrys defense minister, Hanno Pevkur, said in an interview on the sidelines of the meeting that his pitch to allies was that \"each country of NATO provide just one or two brigades\" worth of winter gear and Ukraine would be assured enough warm clothing to get through the months of freezing weather.\n\n\"I think everybody expects that winter will impact the level of activity,\" the U.K.s defense chief, Adm. Sir Tony Radakin, told reporters on a visit to Washington this month. \"But I think weve got to be cautious overplaying that because this is not grand maneuver warfare. Much of it is skirmishes, artillery battles and seeking opportunities that you then build on.\"\n\nThe mud and frozen ground will constrain both sides, he said, adding that the fighting wont be done by massive formations maneuvering quickly, but through a grinding conflict using artillery and drones to try to push frontlines forward or hold ground, yard by yard.\n\nBut now the word coming from NATO capitals is that they are all in on helping Kyiv endure the coming months of freezing weather and slogging progress. And top Western officials say they believe Ukraine will keep pushing forward.\n\n\"I expect that Ukraine will continue to do everything it can throughout the winter to regain its territory and to be effective on the battlefield,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in Brussels. \"Were going to do everything we can to make sure that they have whats required to be effective.\"\n\nLikewise, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that in the coming weeks and months, \"our task is to enable them to also be able to conduct meaningful operations throughout the winter and continue to supply them with everything from fuel, winter clothing, tents to advanced weapons systems.\"\n\nConversely, Russian forces continue to fall back, and even began evacuating up to 60,000 civilians to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Wednesday, a move that may be part of a larger Russian military retreat from the key city and the surrounding region. Vladimir Putin also declared martial law in the four Ukrainian districts he recently claimed to annex, a move that may allow for forced conscription there in the dwindling areas Russia still controls.\n\nThe Russian pullback comes as Iranian-made drones pound civilian targets and infrastructure, a civilian terror campaign that has already damaged about 30 percent of the nations power-generating capabilities, according to Kyiv.\n\nThe new Russian campaign is in keeping with its tactic of brutalizing the civilian population as its troops continue to suffer defeats on the battlefield, and is being orchestrated by Putins new commander, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, whose nickname of \"General Armageddon\" was earned in the brutal, civilian-focused air campaign in Syria. The general made a rare appearance on Russian television Tuesday evening, in which he acknowledged the Russian position around Kherson is \"very difficult.\"\n\nWhile the West appears to be focused, Russia continues to experience \"significant\" logistical and sustainment challenges, and those are only going to get harder as winter sets in, said Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder.\n\n\"Time is certainly of the essence when it comes to capitalizing on that from an operational standpoint,\" he told reporters Tuesday. But Ryder acknowledged that the winter months will be difficult for the Ukrainian side as well.\n\n\"When you look at things like, you know, rain, snow, mud, the impact that it has on the terrain,\" Ryder said, \"it definitely will add another level of complexity to an already very-dynamic battlefield.\"\n\nThose problems might be borne more heavily by the often lightly-equipped Russian troops who are being forced to rely on supply lines the Ukrainians are intent on disrupting or cutting, and who will have to burrow into hastily dug trenches and fortifications amid a hostile populace.\n\nThe chaotic callup of 300,000 Russian reservists, who have flooded social media with videos of conscripts sleeping in muddy fields and warming themselves over makeshift fires while still at collection centers inside Russia, gives a glimpse of how poorly-equipped many Russian units are, and what challenges might await.\n\nGetting proper winter clothing for front-line troops and the tens of thousands of callups expected to flow into Ukraine in the coming weeks will be a massive challenge for Moscow, which has struggled mightily to keep troops supplied since the start of the war.\n\nAs Kherson empties out and barely trained and lightly equipped Russian conscripts begin to flow into Ukraine, the war will take a new shape. \"I would say Ukrainians are better equipped for it, and they certainly have the motivation to cope with it,\" the Western official said.\n\nLara Seligman and Cristina Gallardo contributed to this report.",

                "cc_text": "Germany shocked life into the future of battle tanks when it released details of its new KF51 Panther this summer. Painted in green, yellow, and gray digital camo, the tank has a sleek hull and an imposing turret. But its most exciting features are unseen: high-tech active armor that explodes just prior to being struck, directing munitions away from the tank; the potential to support AI-powered weapons; its own drones that it can release to electronically jam enemy radars; and remote-controlled lasers that will fire at enemies without the tank crew having to leave the armored hull.\n\nThis sophisticated battlefield vehicle might not see action for another decade, but some of those technologies are already appearing on tanks from Russia, China, Turkey, and the United States as armies rally to modernize tanks to defend against increasingly effective anti-tank weapons. The battlefields of Ukraine clearly reveal the devastation of those technologies. Ukraines army has destroyed as many as 936 of Russias aging T-72 and T-80 tanks. Images of exploded and burned hulls serve notice that armored fighting vehicles are no longer the impenetrable fortresses they were when they dominated World Wars I and II.\n\nDespite Russias heavy tank losses in Ukraine, experts expect its newest and most sophisticated tank to roll out as soon as this year with new technologies and weapons systems that might rival those of Germanys Panther. Many of those updates reflect the changing role of main battle tanksa designation for the heavily armored, fast, powerful, do-it-all battlefield vehicles. No longer a devastating attack weapon, modern tanks, analysts say, are taking on vital but more limited battlefield roles supporting infantry forces on the front lines.\n\nIn the journal Military Review, Institute for Defense Analyses scholars Alec Wahlman and Col. Brian M. Drinkwine (Ret.) contrast the disastrous 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, made infamous in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down, with the successful U.S. invasion of Baghdad in 2003. In Baghdad, tanks carried soldiers and Marines into the city; in Somalia, only aircraft and tactical vehicles accompanied infantry troops, and the troops took heavy casualties.\n\n\"Lack of even a modest U.S. armor presence in Somalia hobbled mission efforts,\" Wahlman and Drinkwine wrote. \"In stark contrast, the rapid seizure of Baghdad and quick defeat of organized Iraqi forces at the outset of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 were largely the result of Iraqi inability to effectively counter highly mobile heavy armor in an urban environment.\"\n\nAs long as a human soldier fights on a field, along a muddy road, or on foot in a town or village, the battle tank will likely also be there, providing essential cover.\n\n\"When you need a tank, you need a tank,\" says Maj. Adam Link, a former Marine tank officer. \"Theres nothing really that can replace it on the battlefield.\"\n\nSo even as militaries prioritize air power and technological warfare systems, the armored tank remains a critical weapon, and countries are scrambling to update aging designs. The following 16 models are the most advanced, powerful, and important heavily armored vehicles in the world.\n\nU.S.: M1A2 Abrams SEPv3\n\nNurPhoto\n\nYear introduced: 2020 | Crew: Four | Weight: 73.6 tons | Cost: $6.2 million\n\nDating from 1980, the M1 Abrams tank family lacks some of the flashy features built into tanks of the twenty-first century. But its rugged, reliable General Dynamics Land Systems engineering and consistent upgrades have kept it dominant in every conflict it has faced. Abrams tanks crippled Iraqi armored formations in the 1991 Battle of 73 Easting, considered the last great tank showdown of the twentieth century. In just 23 minutes, nine American M1A1 Abrams tanks destroyed 50 Iraqi T-72 tanks and dozens more armored vehicles using their long-range firing capabilities to wreak havoc without taking a single casualty. Abrams tanks also shored up infantry formations during the 2003 assault on Baghdad, and supported patrols to a lesser extent in Afghanistan. Each successive version of the M1 has received additional armor, with the M1A2 SEPv3, introduced in 2020, weighing 13 tons more than the original due to these upgrades.\n\nThe newest variant features a turret-mounted, low-profile, common-remote-operated weapons station (LP CROWS) that captures video by day and thermal imaging by night, with automatic target tracking and a laser range finder. The 120mm smoothbore M256 main gun now fires an advanced multipurpose round, developed over 15 years to replace four separate tank munitions. The round can be dispatched to bust a bunker or breach a wall to clear the way for ground troops; or in airburst mode, it can take out anti-tank guided missile teams from as far as 2,000 meters away. As of 2021, all Abrams tanks also feature the same Trophy Active Protection System introduced on the Israeli Merkava Mark IV.\n\nIsrael: Merkava Mark IV\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nYear introduced: 2004 | Crew: Four, plus six passengers | Weight: 71 tons | Cost: $4.5 million\n\nMerkava means \"chariot,\" an appropriate name for a tank designed to carry extra passengers and packed with features to ensure their survival. The Merkava family of tanks emerged not long after 1973s Yom Kippur War and was used in the 1982 Lebanon War and a half dozen conflicts since. The Merkava Mark IV, introduced in 2004, has a unique design that mounts the engine near the front of the vehicle, creating space for up to eight passengers in addition to the crew of four. While dated, the Israeli tank remains viable thanks to its Trophy Active Protection System; the countermeasures shield is still best-in-class technology and was first used on the Merkava IV. Trophy works by using vehicle-mounted radars to track and classify incoming projectiles. When an enemy missile is identified, the tank fires small explosive projectiles that destroy the munition without damaging the tank itself. Trophy proved effective in its very first combat test in 2011, when a Merkava equipped with the system neutralized a rocket-propelled grenade fired by Palestinian troops from Gaza. Even more tech breakthroughs may be ahead for the Merkava: In 2018, the Israel Defense Forces announced plans for the Merkava Mark IV Barak, a first-of-its-kind \"smart tank\" upgrade that uses sensors and AI to take over such mundane crew tasks as navigating around obstacles and scanning for threats. The tank maker is also developing an \"Iron View\" virtual-reality helmet that will allow crew members to see beyond the hull for a 360-degree view of the battlefield.\n\nJapan: Type 10\n\nYuya Shino\n\nYear introduced: 2012 | Crew: Three | Weight: 48 tons, fully loaded | Cost: $9 million+\n\nJapans Type 10 is widely considered the worlds first fourth-generation tank, which means it boasts some of the early iterations of the advanced weapons well see on future tanks like the Panther. Engineered by Japans Technical Research and Development Institute over 10 years, the Type 10 is light without sacrificing armor or firepower. At just 48 tons at its heaviest configurationcompare that with the M1 Abrams at 73 tonsthe body of the Type 10 features modular ceramic armor that can be added or removed in segments to deliver protection where its needed most. The hull and turret are made with nanocrystal steel shot through with carbon nodules, which makes the metal exceptionally light and strong. The 120mm L/44 smoothbore gun is incredibly accurate, thanks to a laser range finder and a fire-control system that can automatically track, identify, and classify targets. The tanks active hydropneumatic suspension system (a technology invented by the automaker Citron for its sports cars) smooths the ride, making it easier for crews to aim the gun while on the move. During an impressive demonstration of the technology shown in a video posted on YouTube in 2015, a Japanese officer sets two glasses next to the barrel of the tanks main gun and fills them with wine. As the Type 10 pitches up and down and the turret rotates nearly 180 degrees, the shock-absorbing suspension keeps the barrel completely level and the wine glasses spill-free.\n\nGermany: Leopard 2A7\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nYear introduced: 2014 | Crew: Four | Weight: 71 tons | Cost: $8.8 million+\n\nWith more than 3,500 units in operation and used by 19 countries, Germanys Leopard is one of the most common tanks on the planet. The 2A7+ variant is optimized for urban operations and low-intensity conflict, with added frontal protection and more modular armor to shield against roadside bombs and rocket-propelled grenades. The tanks popularity reflects a changing battlespace where fighting may take place block to block in densely populated cities. The Leopard fires DM11 high-explosive rounds that can be programmed to detonate on impact, above a target, or on a delay to create more damage. An FLW 200 remote-weapons station offers battlefield surveillance, sniper detection, and the ability for crew members to fire on the enemy from inside the hull, never exposing themselves to danger. Recent upgrades prioritize crew comfort, with compartment cooling systems in the turret and chassis. Earlier versions of the Leopard patrolled Kosovo in 1999 and supported the Canadian military in Afghanistan. While older versions of Leopard 2 have taken heat for their performance in Syria, where ISIS allegedly took out 10 Turkish-operated tanks with guided missiles and improvised explosive devices, the 2A7, with its active protection system and beefed-up armor, has proven much harder to defeat.\n\nGermany: KF51 Panther\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nYear to be introduced: 2035 (Projected) | Crew: Three | Weight: 65 tons | Cost: Unknown\n\nStill years from production, this powerful new tank from the German armament giant Rheinmetall is generating massive interest in the defense community. Named in honor of the Panther, a WWII-era medium tank, it will replace Germanys current Leopard 2 and French Leclerc. Its set to have a huge 130mm main gun, compared with the 120 and 125mm weapons of its most advanced peers. Called the Rheinmetall Future Gun System, the weapon purports to be 50 percent more effective than 120mm systems. Its also being built to carry HERO 120 loitering munitions, also known as \"kamikaze drones,\" which can fly in a designated airspace while identifying a target, and then dive into it. Rheinmetall says it will build versions with an optional fourth workstation for a drone operator, and the defense contractor says its also developing a fully autonomous version, removing humans from the tank completely.\n\nSouth Korea: K2 Black Panther\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nYear introduced: 2014 | Crew: Three | Weight: 61 tons | Cost: $8.5 million+\n\nOne of the newest sets of armor on the world stage, the K2 Black Panther might be the most adaptable tank ever made. Its watertight turret and top-mounted snorkel allow it to submerge to depths of more than 12 feet to cross bodies of water. Its advanced \"in-arm suspension unit\" system allows the crew to raise the chassis up to 16 inches to cover rocky terrain, or angle it to \"kneeling\" or \"sitting\" profiles to increase targeting options for the main gun. The suspension gives the CN08 120mm 55-caliber smoothbore gun up to 24 degrees of elevation, enabling it to better target low-flying aircraft, compared to just 20 degrees for the Abrams tank. The K2 sports a combination of classified steel-plate and explosive reactive armor (ERA)metal panels containing C4 or another plastic explosive that detonate outward when hit by a shaped charge, such as a rocket-propelled grenade. Despite a total weight of just 55 tons, the tanks armor has reportedly withstood a direct hit from one of its own 120mm tungsten-core sabot rounds in testing.\n\nUnited Kingdom: Challenger 2\n\nJoe Giddens - PA Images\n\nYear introduced: 1997 | Crew: Four | Weight: 62.5 tons | Cost: $4.9 million (1999)\n\nTank warfare originated when Great Britain introduced the worlds first tank, the Mark 1, at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. So its fitting that the U.K. still operates one of the worlds most powerful tanks. In service since 1998 and updated several times since, the Challenger 2 lacks the sophisticated defenses of modern Gen-4 tanks, but its 120mm main gun is well regarded for its accuracy and reliability. Plus, it can carry 50 rounds, versus the M1A2 Abramss 42. The original Challengers gun earned battle cred in 1991 when it notched a five-kilometer tank-to-tank kill against an Iraqi vehiclestill the longest ever recorded. In addition to Chobham ceramic-composite armor, the Challenger 2s defenses include a smokescreen generated by shooting diesel into the tanks exhaust manifold. The thick, choking fumes are intended to obscure the Challenger and any surrounding ground forces while distracting and flustering the enemy.\n\nFrance: Leclerc Scorpion XLR\n\nEMMANUEL DUNAND\n\nYear introduced: 2022 | Crew: Three | Weight: 63 tons | Cost: $4 million+\n\nFrances 1990s-era tank received formidable updates this year. The new Leclerc Scorpion XLR version includes a next-generation counter-IED jammer and GALIX, a passive countermeasures system that hides a vehicle from the enemy by using smart sensors to fire decoys or a 360-degree smoke cloud from 24 vehicle-mounted launchers. The Leclerc boasts exceptional fuel efficiency: Its operational range is more than 340 miles, some 117 miles better than that of the Abrams. Its updated modular armor includes a unique wire-cage configuration on the rear of the hull and chassis that gives the engine additional protection against rocket-propelled grenadesa response to the growing threat from shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles in urban warfare. Its Giat Industries 120mm smoothbore main gun is 6.2 meters long, giving it greater muzzle velocity than the typical 44-caliber guns of its era. The XLR also has a turret-mounted, remote-operated weapons station that lets the crew fire a 7.62mm machine gun from within the tank.\n\nRussia: T-90\n\nSasha Mordovets\n\nYear introduced: 1992 | Crew: Three | Weight: 51 tons | Cost: $4.5 million (2016)\n\nRussias T-90 has been criticized for the frequency of its defeats in Ukraine. Based on the Soviet T-72 chassis and upgraded most recently in 2017, it features explosive-reactive armor and a Russian Shtora-1 active protection system that includes a pair of electro-optical/infrared \"dazzlers,\" which look like glowing red eyes on the front of the turret and can thwart enemy missiles targeting systems. But those defenses have failed against Javelin anti-tank missiles in Syria, and even against Carl Gustaf 84mm recoilless rifles in Ukraine. Defense experts say the design, which stores ammunition in the turret, is vulnerable when hitthe ignited ammo can turn the tank into a jack-in-the-box, blowing the turret off. While this flaw demonstrates Russias tendency to prioritize firepower over survivability in tank design, the T-90 is not a complete failure. Its low-lying hull makes it hard to hit, and its steel-composite, reactive-blend armor is designed to defeat anti-tank rounds. Plus, its 2A46m 125mm smoothbore gun has become more accurate with successive upgrades. Perhaps most appealing about this workhorse tank is the price: an economical $2.5 to 4.5 million, which allowed Russia to maintain as many as 1,000 T-90s at one point.\n\nRussia: T-14 Armata\n\nALEXANDER NEMENOV\n\nYear introduced: 2022 | Crew: Three | Weight: 52 tons | Cost: $4 million\n\nRussia may be losing scores of Soviet-engineered T-72 and T-80 tanks in Ukraine and has reportedly deployed at least a few of its far more advanced T-90M Proryv tanks as wellbut the countrys most devastating mobile fortress has yet to hit the battlefield. The T-14 Armata promises next-generation design and deadliness. Its sleek, low-riding hull houses a sophisticated command suite, complete with an unmanned, remote-controlled turret, 360-degree panoramic sight, and automatic fire-control system that can classify and identify targets before a human operator spots them. In addition to its 2A82-1M 125mm smoothbore cannon with autoloader, the Armata reportedly features a new kind of defensive weapon: a 3VD35 protective aerosol \"smokescreen\" that blocks an enemys weapon-guidance systems by reflecting heat and light back at them. The advanced technology and cuts in Russian defense spending, however, seem to be bogging the Armata down. Russia has planned to begin production by 2020, but the tank may not be ready until 2023 or later.\n\nUkraine: T-84 Oplot-M\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nYear introduced: 2009 | Crew: Three | Weight: 53 tons | Cost: $5 million\n\nUkraines mightiest tank has barely made an appearance in the countrys war with Russia due to untimely budget shortfalls. Ukraines military acquired only 10 of the highly regarded tanks, and it sold four of those to the United States. The Oplot-M, based on the Soviet-designed T-80, has a powerful 1,500-horsepower, six-cylinder diesel engine that gives the tank a top speed of 43 miles per hour. Its Zaslon active protection system, designed to be used alongside explosive-reactive armor, can withstand impacts from incoming missiles traveling at speeds of up to 1,200 meters per second. While Ukraine did not invest substantially in this design, Thailand did, purchasing 49 lightly modified Oplot tanks in 2011.\n\nNorth Korea: Pokpung-Ho\n\nED JONES\n\nYear introduced: 2002 | Crew: Four | Weight: 44.3 tons | Cost: Unknown\n\nNearly everything in North Koreas dictatorship is shrouded in mystery and deception, including information on its tanks. The Pokpung-Ho, or Storm Tiger, is formally known in the North as the Chonma-215 or Chonma-216, depending on its main armament. The Chonma-215 fires the same 115mm 2A20 round as the Soviet T-62 tank, while the more modern Chonma-216 has the 125mm 2A46 smoothbore round found on tanks used by more than a dozen other nations. Each model incorporates elements of legacy Soviet T-72 and Chinese Type-85 tanks, apparently reverse-engineered and modified to fit the North Koreans requirements. An official foreign weapons assessment by the U.S. Armys Training and Doctrine Command underscores the uncertainty: While the Pokpung-Ho is believed to have been introduced in 2002, it is possible the tank entered service as early as 1992. Likewise, its hard to verify how well the tanks impressive-looking weapons work. Its unlikely that the North can afford to fire the conventional tungsten-tipped rounds from the Chonma-216s main gun, and resorting to steel-tipped rounds would leave it unable to breach other world-class tanks. Its secondary weapons, however, pack loads of firepower. Its pair of what analysts believe to be 9K38 Igla surface-to-air missile launchers provides a short-range air defense, something that is extremely unusual for a tank. The turret-mounted machine gun, a KPV 14.5mm weapon designed for anti-aircraft use, gives the tank commander more firepower beyond the conventional 7.62mm coaxial gun.\n\nChina: Type 99A\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nYear introduced: 2011 | Crew: Three | Weight: 64 tons | Cost: $2.6 million\n\nThanks to a 1,500-horsepower engine and a light, 55-ton body, the Type 99A can reportedly move at nearly 50 miles per hour. This advanced version of Chinas first mass-produced modern tank features a distinctive angular turret profile and composite armor that is further enhanced by explosive-reactive side panels. The 99As Chinese-made GL5 active protection system can sense incoming anti-tank guided missiles out to 100 meters and neutralize them or knock them off course with 12 mounted launchers. A line-of-sight laser communication system can transmit encrypted messages out to 2.2 miles and also help the crew distinguish between friends and enemies by interpreting their radio frequency emissions. With more than 7,000 tanks in its inventory by some accounts, China is second only to Russia in mechanized power and maintains an estimated 1,200 Type 99s alone.\n\nTurkey: Altay\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nYear to be introduced: 2023 (Projected) | Crew: Four | Weight: 61 tons | Cost: $13.75 million\n\nWhen the first Altay rolls off the production line next year, it will represent the first time Turkey has designed and manufactured its own tank since World War II. The vehicle is named for a revered Turkish cavalry commander and comes with some of the most advanced tech and armor on any tank. A Volkan-II fire-control system features electrical gun and turret stabilizers that allow for accurate firing at top speeds; plus, a Turkish-made AKKOR active protection system incorporates an advanced vehicle-mounted radar that can detect incoming threats fasteven at close rangeand electronically disrupt their flight pattern or fire explosive countermeasures for tank protection. The chassis is similar to that of South Koreas K2 Black Panther and fits modular composite armor made by the Turkish company Roketsan. At an estimated $13.8 million apiece, the Altay will be the most expensive tank ever produced. The sophisticated defenses and weapons systems of modern tanks dont come cheap.\n\nItaly: C1 Ariete\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nYear introduced: 1995 | Crew: Four | Weight: 59 tons | Cost: $4.9 million\n\nItalys only tank is a dated but respectable battlefield weapon. The Ariete, which translates to \"battering ram,\" sports a 12-cylinder, 1,250-horsepower engine made by the Italian carmaker Fiat-Iveco that enables it to traverse a 60 percent gradepractically a vertical wall. A setup that tank designers call \"hunter-killer\" gives the commander a panoramic view of surroundings without having to change position or open the turret. Despite having a similar profile and comparable armor to allied tanks like the Abrams, the Ariete is significantly outranged by its NATO counterparts: Its thermal sight is effective to only about 1,500 meters, while the Abrams can hit targets beyond 3,000 and 4,000 meters. But in the 2016 Strong Europe Tank Challenge, hosted by the U.S. and German militaries, an Ariete crew held its own, finishing fourth of seven, ahead of the two Abrams crews.\n\nPoland: PT-91 Twardy\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nYear introduced: 1995 | Crew: Three | Weight: 50 tons | Cost: $5.9 million\n\nPolands aging main battle tank gained new relevance when the country sent an unspecified number of these tanks to Ukraine. Its likely to be a formidable addition to the aging Soviet T-64s and T-72s Ukraine is already using to defend itself against Russian forces. Introduced in 1995, the Twardy (meaning \"hard\" or \"tough\") is an updated version of the T-72 but features Polish-made ERAWA explosive-reactive armor across the surface of the vehicle, with a double layer of explosive on the hull and turret. It also adds a modern auto-loading mechanism to the 2A46 125mm main gun, which eliminates a crew member and enables faster firing.",

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\nRussia has launched a series of \"kamikaze\" drone attacks across Ukraine in recent weeks, striking civilian infrastructure and sowing terror in Ukrainian cities far from the frontlines of the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian government says Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and other cities have suffered a barrage of drone attacks, and pleaded with Western countries to step up their assistance in the face of the new challenge.\n\nDrones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since Moscow acquired new drones from Iran over the summer.\n\nThe Ukrainians themselves have been using kamikaze drones to strike against Russian targets and asked their allies to supply them with more of these deadly weapons.\n\nHeres what we know about these drones.\n\nWhat are kamikaze drones?\n\nKamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system. They are known as a \"loitering munition\" because they are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only striking once an enemy asset is identified.\n\nThey are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance.\n\nThe name \"kamikaze\" refers to the fact the drones are disposable. Unlike more traditional, larger and faster military drones that return to base after dropping missiles, kamikaze drones are designed to crash into a target and explode, detonating their warhead and destroying the drones in the process. They are smaller and more easily controlled than cruise missiles.\n\nParts of what Ukrainian authorities say is an Iranian Shahed-136 drone are seen in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on October 6, 2022. Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Reuters\n\nA Ukrainian police officer inspects a part of a shot-down drone in Kharkiv, on October 6, 2022. Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Reuters\n\nWhich drones is Russia using in Ukraine?\n\nThe Ukrainian military and US intelligence say Russia is using Iranian-made attack drones. US officials told CNN in July that Iran had begun showcasing Shahed series drones to Russia at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran the previous month.\n\nIn August, US officials said Russia had bought these drones and was training its forces how to use them. According to Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran.\n\nIran has denied supplying weapons to Russia despite evidence to the contrary. Iranian Foreign Minister Spokesman Nasser Kanaani was quoted by the state news agency IRNA on Monday as saying \"Iran has repeatedly declared that it is not a party in the war between Russia and Ukraine and has not sent any weapons to either side.\"\n\nBut Ukraine claimed its forces had shot down one of these drones for the first time last month near the city of Kupyansk in Kharkiv. There have been more reported attacks since then. Kyivs military said Wednesday it had downed 17 Shahed-136 drones that day alone. According to photos released by Ukrainian authorities, Russia has rebranded the Shaheds and is using them under the name of \"Geran.\"\n\nUS officials say there has been \"some evidence already\" that the Iranian drones \"have already experienced numerous failures\" on the battlefield.\n\nUS Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Sasha Baker told reporters late last month that \"the idea that they represent some technological leap ahead, frankly were just not seeing borne out in the data.\"\n\nMoscow also has its own kamikaze drones, made by the Russian weapons manufacturer Kalashnikov Concern. Ukraine claimed on Wednesday it had shot down two of these ZALA Lancet drones that day.\n\nHow much damage can the drones cause?\n\nWhile relatively small, the Shahed drones are capable of carrying missiles and have a payload of approximately 50 kilograms (110 pounds). That means they can inflicted significant damage.\n\nRetired Australian Army Major General Mick Ryan told CNN the drones are \"generally of limited utility against military targets that require precision.\"\n\n\"So the Russians are using these fairly unsophisticated drones against large targets like cities. As you mention there is no military utility to these attacks, this is about Putin satisfying hardliners in Russia they were in ecstasy last week after the missile attacks and probably will be after these ones,\" he said.\n\nDrone attacks can have major impact on the civilian population. Zelensky accused Moscow of using them to spread terror among civilians.\n\n\"All night and all morning, the enemy terrorizes the civilian population. Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine,\" he said Monday.\n\nAs air raid sirens rang through the capital city, many people spent hours hiding in basements, underground stations and bomb shelters, while schools returned to online education.\n\nIn a statement last week, the International Red Cross denounced the use of the drones, saying the use of explosive weapons in populated areas causes mental and psychological harm as well as life-threatening injuries.\n\nHow can Ukraine defend itself against these drones?\n\nUkraine has been asking its allies for air defense systems since the beginning of the war in February, but the need has become more urgent since Russia started using the Iranian-made drones.\n\nAir defense systems were one of the top three priorities on a Ukrainian weapons wish list presented during a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, according to a handout provided to defense ministers participating in the gathering.\n\nGen. Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters after the meeting on Wednesday that the US and its allies needed to provide Ukraine with air defense systems in order for Ukraine to help defend its airspace against incoming attacks from Russian forces.\n\n\"Many countries have Patriot, many countries have other systems, theres a whole series of Israeli systems that are quite capable, the Germans have systems as we mentioned, so a lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems,\" Milley said.\n\n\"The task will be to bring those together, get them deployed, get them trained, because each of these systems is different, make sure they can link together with a command and control and communication systems and make sure they have radars that can talk to each other so they can acquire targets on the inbound flights.\"\n\nThe air defenses Ukraine needs to combat kamikaze drones are different from the systems that are used against cruise missiles and similar weapons. The Patriot air defense missile system which stands for \"Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target\" is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, as well as advanced aircraft and cruise missiles, and could be used against drones.\n\nUkrainian officials said that Ukrainian air defense forces were already taking down the \"bulk\" of the Shahed drones. Ukraines senior military commander, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, tweeted Tuesday his thanks to Poland as \"brothers in arms\" for training an air defense battalion that he said had destroyed nine of 11 Shaheds. He said Poland had given Ukraine \"systems\" to help destroy the drones.\n\nLast month there were reports that the Polish government had bought advanced Israeli equipment (Israel has a policy of not selling \"advanced defensive technology\" to Kyiv) and was then transferring it to Ukraine.\n\nZelensky made another plea for more air defense capacities on Thursday, saying Kyiv has only about 10% of what it needs to combat Moscows attacks.\n\nDoes Ukraine have kamikaze drones too?\n\nThe Ukrainian military has been using RAM II kamikaze drones, which were developed by a consortium of Ukrainian companies and bought with money crowdfunded by ordinary Ukrainians. These precision-guided loitering munitions can carry 3 kilogram (6.6 pound) warheads and have a flight range of up to 30 kilometers (18.6 miles), according to the manufacturers.\n\nBut Kyiv has also been relying on its allies for drone supplies. The US has sent several types of aerial weapon systems to Ukraine. These include Switchblade drones small, portable kamikaze drones that can carry a warhead and detonate on impact. The Switchblade 300 and the larger Switchblade 600 are produced by American defense company AeroVironment.\n\nThe smaller Switchblade 300 can hit a target up to 6 miles away (9.6 kilometers), according to specifications provided by the company, while the larger Switchblade 600 can strike more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Both systems can be set up and launched within minutes.\n\nIn May, the US sent the Ukrainian military \"phoenix ghost\" drones, which are believed to be similar to Switchblade, although little is known about their capabilities.\n\nThe UK has also provided Ukraine with loitering munitions, including 850 hand-launched Black Hornet micro-drones.\n\nUkraine has also been using Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones. These have become something of a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance. However, these are larger and designed to return home after dropping laser-guided bombs or missiles.",

William Parker, the offices military deputy director. He noted that the demonstration will focus on the threat of group 3 drones that have a maximum weight of 1,320 pounds.\n\nSometimes called kamikaze drones, loitering munitions are able to fly to targets and strike with an explosive or other kinetic effect, resulting in both the target and drone being destroyed. The tactic has been repeatedly used during recent conflicts in Ukraine and the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is giving the office ideas of how to defend against them, Parker said.\n\n\"Based on the capability that we have now, we have the technology to defend against those one-way attack drones and thats what we need to continue our development [and] continue our investment,\" he said Oct. 20 during a panel discussion hosted by the University of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Aerospace & Defense Innovation Institute.\n\nThe Armys JCO is currently leading a Pentagon-wide push to address how the U.S. military will combat small UAS on future battlefields. Part of these efforts include hosting demonstrations twice a year with the services and industry that focus on a range of counter-drone tactics from low-collateral interceptors to high-powered microwave technology.\n\nBecause low-tech drones have become an inexpensive asset for militaries around the world, there is an imbalance when considering the cost curve of defensive systems, Parker noted.\n\n\"Do I want to use that $1-million-dollar-plus Patriot missile in order to be able to engage that group 3, one-way attack that is currently inbound?\" he said. \"If that is all I have, then yes I do.\"\n\nThe office needs to collaborate closely with industry to provide less expensive counter-UAS technologies and stabilize that cost curve, he added.\n\nParker said there is no \"silver bullet\" when it comes to counter-drone systems. Instead, the JCO is pursuing a system-of-systems approach that layers both kinetic and non-kinetic effects and is integrated into a common command-and-control system.\n\n\"That allows both the ability to use the best effector against the threat, as well as the warfighter who's actually operating equipment to be able to fight effectively using a common operating picture,\" Parker said.\n\nLayering capabilities would give operators the tools to detect and neutralize threats in varying environments, said Leigh Madden, the CEO of Epirus, a California-based company that specializes in directed energy solutions for counter-UAS efforts.\n\n\"There are technologies like high-powered microwaves that are not affected by the weather. There are other high-power or directed energy technologies, like lasers, that definitely are impacted by weather and smoke and other things,\" he said during the panel. \"So, I truly believe that a layered approach is the right way to go at it.\"\n\nConsidering the events during Russias invasion of Ukraine which has seen both sides employ loitering munitions with success the JCOs efforts are on track, Parker said.\n\n\"On initial blush, it looks like we are headed down the right direction with respect to what we are doing and the lessons that we are pulling out of Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nTopics: Army News, Unmanned Air Vehicles",

The US trained Ukrainian troops on the drones outside the embattled nations borders.\n\nKirby said Iranian troops are primarily helping their Russian counterparts with training and maintenance on the systems, nicknamed \"kamikaze drones\" for their ability to smash into a target to deploy its attached warhead.\n\n\"These are systems that the Russian Armed Forces are not familiar using, and these are organically manufactured Iranian [drones],\" he said. \"The Russians just dont have anything in their inventory, so it follows that they would need a little training on how to pilot these things.\"\n\n4 Russia purchased about 1,000 Shahed-136 drones from Iran in August. Wikipedia\n\nThe Iranian assistance comes after Russias early deployment of the drones showed signs of \"operator and system failures,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"Either they werent being piloted appropriately and properly and were failing to reach target or the systems themselves were suffering failures and not performing to the standards that apparently the customers expected,\" Kirby said. \"So the Iranians decided to move in some trainers and some technical support to help the Russians use them with better lethality.\"\n\nHowever, it did not appear that Iranian troops were physically deploying the weapons for the Russians as of Thursday, he noted.\n\nPrevious 1 of 5 Next Advertisement A residential building destroyed by a Russian drone strike in Kyiv on Oct. 17, 2022.

Pat Ryder told reporters Thursday.\n\n\"Im not going to be able to provide you with numbers on that other than to say that [the drones] have not quite probably met Russian goals in terms of their ability to strike targets,\" Ryder said. \"That said, clearly they have wreaked havoc and caused destruction and killed innocent civilians, so its a serious threat.\"\n\nIn response, the US will \"continue to vigorously enforce all US sanctions on both the Russian and Iranian arms trade,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"The United States is going to pursue all means to expose, deter and confront Irans provision of these munitions against the Ukrainian people,\" he said. \"Were going to make it harder for Iran to sell these weapons to Russia, were going to help the Ukrainians have what they need to defend themselves against these threats and were going to continue to stand with our partners throughout the Middle East region against the Iranian threat.\"\n\n4 Kirby said the Russian military likely needs training to help use the drones. AFP\n\nThe development reinforces recent US-led efforts to supply Ukraine with air defenses. The Pentagons Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which gathers defense officials from more than 50 nations, focused its latest meeting in Brussels last week on protecting Ukraines airspace.\n\nKyiv has been pleading with the US and other NATO nations to help defend its airspace since the initial invasion by Russia Feb. 24, first calling for a no-fly zone over the country and later for donations of fighter jets and Patriot missile defense systems.\n\nThe US has rejected all three requests, but in July pledged eight National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), which are used to protect the White House. The first two NASAMS will arrive later this year, though it could take up to two years to deliver the rest, US defense officials have said.\n\nWhile the Washington Post on Thursday reported Iranian troops were also helping Russians launch drones from military bases in Belarus, Kirby said there is \"no indication\" the Minsk government was involved \"in the transfer, training or operation\" of the Iranian drones.\n\n\"Belarus has certainly provided support to Russias invasion of Ukraine,\" Kirby said. \"That said, we have not seen Belarusian troops actually in Ukraine fighting.\"",

                "cc_text": "Russias growing use of Iranian Shahed-136 drones reflects both strength and weakness. Monday mornings drone bombings in the centre of Kyiv, in two clusters at the time of the morning rush hour, show how the weapons can cause destruction and fear in a capital that until a week ago had not been attacked for months.\n\nThe Shahed-136s first appeared in the war in September, and although they are described as kamikaze drones, they are better thought of as small cruise missiles with a relatively limited destructive capacity given their 50kg payload. Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia had bought 2,400 a large-sounding number, but these are being depleted fast.\n\nJustin Bronk, an airpower specialist at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, says the drones \"are difficult to consistently intercept\" but their airspeed is slow relative to cruise missiles, meaning air defences will always have a chance. \"Ultimately, they offer a way for Russia to cause more civilian and military casualties in Ukraine, but will not turn the tide of the war,\" he said.\n\nIt is the second major attack on Kyiv in a week. Last Monday, in response to the explosion at the Kerch strait bridge into Crimea, Russia unleashed a deadly hail of missile and drone strikes aimed at Kyiv and other major cities.\n\nThe bloody success of last weeks attack an estimated 15 were killed that day alone and the destruction of this Mondays, reveals the limitations in Kyivs air defence. It is not clear why it has taken so long, but the US responded last week by saying it would expedite the delivery of the first two of eight promised Nasams air defence systems, which are deemed good enough to protect the Pentagon.\n\nBut while attacks on Kyiv capture headlines around the world, the military utility is closer to nil and in isolation will have had no meaningful psychological effect on the countrys largely determined civilian population. The attacks provoke fear, but also anger, particularly after Vladimir Putin said there was \"no need\" for more massive strikes on Ukraine.\n\nTheir use also appears to demonstrate that Russia is running short of guided missiles. Western officials said on Friday they agreed broadly with a Ukrainian assessment that Moscow had used up about two-thirds of its stocks, and has only 124 out of 900 medium-range Iskanders left. \"We think thats about right,\" one said, although such conclusions are impossible to verify.\n\nThere were some suggestions on Monday morning that Russia may have partly been trying to target an energy site in the capital, although full details are yet to be confirmed. Nevertheless, more broadly, there are growing signs Russia is trying to target Ukraines energy and other utility grids as the winter and the countrys \"heating season\" begins.\n\nThe point is not lost on the countrys anxious defenders either, with calls for people to reduce electricity use between 5pm and 11pm in the evenings. In the last month power supplies to Kharkiv, Kyiv and Lviv have at times been affected by Russian strikes.\n\nDrones such as the Shahed-136s are more effective against such static targets than they are against armies and, for Moscow, the disruptive impact on Ukraine may be greater. At the same time Russia will want badly to halt Ukraines battlefield advances at least until heavy late-autumn rains are expected to prompt some sort of a pause.\n\nRussias call for the evacuation of civilians from Kherson oblast last week may have been billed as merely temporary by one local official, but it is the next step in a gradual retreat from the west of the Dnieper, where its forces have been going backwards since the beginning of the month.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you whats happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will be easier to defend the city than the open country around it, creating a dilemma for Kyiv as to how far it is willing to blast its way to success.\n\nBut for the moment it is the frontline to watch in the nearly eight-month-long war, where Ukraine appears to hold the initiative on land. Russia also continues to come under pressure in the north-east part of the front too, where Ukraine is seeking to push towards Kreminna, after taking Lyman, and Svatove, a transport hub.\n\nNothing else is working for Moscow. Russia has been flinging mobilised conscripts from its half-a-million draft into the frontline, and the first, depressing reports have emerged of forced recruits dying in places such as Lysychansk after receiving minimal or non-existent training.\n\nUkraines frontline progress is not rapid at present, but it is steady, and the concern has to remain that an under pressure Russia will resort to stepping up its targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure because that is the only tactic that seems, from its point of view, to have any impact.",

                "cc_text": "Firefighters arrive at the scene of a drone attack in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Monday.\n\nIt streaks across the sky and then when its almost too late to take cover lets off a guttural sound like a moped blitzing by. Moments later comes the punch-boom of a deadly explosion.\n\nSmall, propeller-driven drones were first used last month by Russia in its ongoing war on Ukraine. But this week they have taken to the forefront, with dozens deployed daily to dive-bomb Kyiv, Dnipro and Mykolaiv, targeting Ukraines power infrastructure and causing blackouts across the country. At least eight people have been killed in the strikes, Ukrainian authorities say.\n\nThough their markings are in Russian and Moscow refers to them as the Geran-2, Pentagon officials, Ukrainians and observers say the weapons are Iranian-made Shahed-136s, nimble, so-called kamikaze drones (because they destroy themselves in the attack) that can travel thousands of miles before slamming into a target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIranian-made Shahed-136 drones can travel thousands of miles before slamming into a target. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThey came as part of a package comprising thousands of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, that Moscow imported from Tehran earlier this year to replenish its own rapidly vanishing stock of long-range precision missiles. And Thursday, the White House said the U.S. had evidence that a small number of Iranian troops were \"directly engaged on the ground\" in Russian-occupied Crimea to help launch the drones against Ukraine.\n\nThe Iranian drones \"are killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in Ukraine,\" said White House National Security Council coordinator John F. Kirby in a news briefing.\n\nRussia and Iran repeatedly deny such accusations. Tehran says it supports a peaceful resolution to the eight-month conflict and has called on Ukraine to provide evidence of the drones deployment.\n\n\"We have defense cooperation with Russia, but sending weapons and drones against Ukraine is not our policy,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in a phone conversation Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet at the same time, Western condemnation has drawn boasts from Irans military leaders such as Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, who said in a speech Tuesday that Irans drones have become so effective that \"today we have reached a point that 22 world countries are demanding to purchase unmanned aircraft from Iran.\"\n\nA drone approaches its target in Kyiv on Monday. (Yasuyoshi Chiba / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA day later, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also appeared to reference the drones, saying they were \"feats\" that \"bring honor to our country.\"\n\n\"When images of Iranian drones were published a few years ago, they would say theyre photoshopped. Now they say Iranian drones are dangerous, why do you sell them or give them to so-and-so?\" Khamenei said, according to a report from the state-owned Islamic Republic News Agency.\n\nIranian drones have been used for years in deadly attacks in Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates often with little response. But their appearance in Ukraines skies and the growing diplomatic storm that has caused highlight how the Russian invasion continues to force governments to contend with a Cold War-style calculus that accepts increasingly less overlap between the West and Russia.\n\nSaudi Arabia ran afoul of that equation earlier this month when it pushed oil production cuts at an OPEC+ meeting, infuriating the U.S., which said that the move signaled Riyadh had sided with Moscow and that it would now have to review its longstanding relationship with its Middle East ally.\n\nDrone sales have also prompted geopolitical recalculations.\n\nFirefighters respond after a Russian attack in Kyiv on Tuesday.

(Ukrainian State Emergency Service / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nFor Iran, which had a relatively amiable relationship with Ukraine, fractures first appeared in September, when Ukrainian forces began shooting down hundreds of drones, including what they said were Shahed-136s. In response, officials in Kyiv downgraded relations with Tehran, stripping the Iranian ambassador of his accreditation and reducing diplomatic personnel at the embassy.\n\nThis weeks attacks pushed Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to propose a full severing of diplomatic ties with Iran.\n\nLeaders in Tehran would \"bear the most severe responsibility\" if they continue arms sales, Kyiv said, while inviting United Nations Secretary-General Antnio Guterres to dispatch inspectors and examine the wreckage of the more than 220 drones it claims to have destroyed thus far. The arms transfers, the U.S and Ukraine say, violate U.N. sanctions against Iran and Security Council Resolution 2231, which is related to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, with Tehran to limit its nuclear program.\n\nThe proposal, publicly supported by several U.N. Security Council members after the bodys closed-door meeting Wednesday, infuriated Moscow, whose Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said afterward that the Guterres team should \"not go beyond their technical mandate.\"\n\n\"Iran is of the firm belief that none of its arms exports, including UAVs, to any country\" violate resolution 2231, Irans U.N. envoy, Amir Saeid Iravani, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nA woman arranges flowers Wednesday outside a Kyiv house where a couple were killed in a Russian drone strike two days earlier. (Ed Ram / Getty Images)\n\nThe threat of additional sanctions on what is already one of the worlds most heavily sanctioned nations comes at a difficult time for Iran, rocked by weeks of protests after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of the so-called morality police.\n\nThose demonstrations have become an expression of wider grievances, including what many view as the governments intransigence in negotiations that could provide sanctions relief. Meanwhile, polls show the Iranian public doesnt view Russia favorably and believes the invasion of Ukraine is illegitimate.\n\nIts unlikely Iran would accept punishment in the name of supporting Moscow. And before the drone sales, trade between the two countries was $4 billion, hardly worth the financial hit from more sanctions.\n\nYet its a calculation Tehran appears willing to make, said Ali Vaez, who directs the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, even at the expense of completely killing off the nuclear deal.\n\n\"The view there is: Why should they abandon Russia at the time of its need, when even if the JCPOA is restored, theyre completely disillusioned about its effectiveness and the durability of sanctions relief that it offers?\" Vaez said. \"The strategic priority, for Iran, of preventing Russias failure in the Ukraine conflict is bigger than the restoration of the JCPOA.\"\n\nAnother Middle East power facing a balancing act with sales of UAVs in the conflict is Turkey. Its Bayraktar TB2 drones a medium-sized aircraft that can launch missiles have in years past faced off against Russian armor and Russia-aligned fighters in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh. Now in Ukraine they hunt Russian troops, with Kyiv deploying the dozens of TB2s it purchased to such powerful effect that Ukrainians dedicated a song to the drones battlefield prowess.\n\nAt the same time, Russia is a vital economic trading partner: It provides almost half of Turkeys natural gas and almost three-quarters of its wheat. Some 4.7 million Russian travelers visit Turkey every year.\n\nDiplomatically, Turkey has hedged: It condemned the invasion but nevertheless refused to levy sanctions and continues to welcome Russian oligarchs and other visitors. It also worked on a deal that allowed grain shipments to leave Ukrainian ports despite a Russian sea blockade.\n\nThough Russia complained to Turkey over the Bayraktar TB2 sales, Ankara said Kyiv had purchased the drones in a private capacity and did not constitute an agreement between the two governments. For now, Moscow appears to have been mollified: Baykar, the company that produces the TB2s, continues to sell them to Ukraine even as Ankara says it can play the role of intermediary between Moscow and the West.\n\nThe ripple effects of the presumptive Iranian drone attacks have also hit Israel, a top U.S. ally with strong links to Russia.\n\nRoughly 15% of Israels population (some 1.3 million people) are Russian-speaking immigrants with more Russian emigres arriving by the month because of the Ukraine war, according to Israeli government statistics.\n\nIsrael also works with Moscow to coordinate military maneuvers in Syria, where Russia has bolstered forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad since 2019 while turning a blind eye to Israeli strikes over Syrian territory on what it says are targets affiliated with Iran, Israels regional nemesis.\n\nAnd the Israelis have previously exported UAV tech and components to Moscow, including two surveillance drones deployed by the Russian army, the Zastava and Forpost, licensed copies of Israeli-built platforms, according to a report from Conflict Armament Research.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Israel didnt join in the U.S. and European Union economic sanctions, but it did dispatch humanitarian aid including helmets and bulletproof vests for rescue teams to Ukraine.\n\nFearing Russian umbrage, Israel has thus far refrained from providing Kyiv with military assistance, despite repeated entreaties. But with its arch-nemesis now embroiled in the conflict, its position appears increasingly untenable.\n\nThis week, an Israeli lawmaker demanded the government change its stance. That appeared to elicit a response from former Russian president and top Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev, who warned Monday that arming Ukraine would be \"a very reckless step\" that \"would destroy government relations between our countries.\"\n\nA day later, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba reiterated a long-standing request for Israel to \"urgently provide antiaircraft systems and to start high-quality cooperation on obtaining appropriate technologies for Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Iran is a red line for Israel, and after Iran has directly, in fact, become complicit in the crime of aggression against Ukraine, I think anyone in Israel who still has any hesitation about whether or not to help Ukraine, he must dispel these hesitations,\" Kuleba said.\n\nBut Israel refused again.\n\n\"Israel will not deliver weapon systems to Ukraine due to a variety of operational considerations,\" Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said during a meeting with EU ambassadors in Tel Aviv, adding that Israel would continue to support Ukraine \"within our limitations.\"\n\nThat, however, is not enough, Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk said.\n\n\"You cant win the war with air defense alert systems. We asked for defensive weapons, and they have all our requests and no reply,\" he said in a CNN interview Wednesday.\n\n\"Its like when youre going to the market and youre asking someone for the bread, and instead of the bread they give you the spoon.\"",

                "cc_text": "Escalation is a cornerstone of Russian President Vladimir Putins strategy in his war against Ukraine, especially as Ukrainian counter-offensives have steadily rolled back Russian gains. As his setbacks mount, its important to address some key questions: How can Ukraine and its partners prevent further escalation to the nuclear level while denying Russia a chance to seize victory from the jaws of defeat. And if such escalation occurs, how should the West respond?\n\nAfter the initial attack on Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities, Russian escalation has occurred in several phases in response to its losses on the battlefield. These include the artillery assault in the Donbas, Russias mobilization, illegal annexations and martial law in four oblasts, probable sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, and massive recent attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure.\n\nIn each case, Russian escalation was aimed at gaining battlefield advantage and breaking Ukraines will. It has not succeeded in either purpose. Nevertheless, Putin will undoubtedly escalate again in the face of failure to achieve his shrinking war aims and to stave off strategic defeat. Ignoring his threats to escalate further, including through the use of nuclear weapons, is not sound policy. Instead, measures need to be in place to deter and, if necessary, respond to this threat in ways that impose heavy costs for Russian misbehavior but do not further escalate the conflict.\n\nFurther escalation will depend on the battlefield situation\n\nUkraine has used the arms the United States and its NATO allies have provided to launch successful counter-offensives in the Kharkiv region and in parts of the Kherson region, and it has clawed back some of Russias mid-summer gains in Donbas. The jury is out as to whether these events will lead to a collapse of the Russian military effort in Ukraine or to a prolonged stalemate. While there are many signs of potential Russian military collapse, Russian forces are now digging in with the natural advantages of defensive positions. With more competent leadership under General Sergei Surovikin and additional manpower through mobilization, Moscow may be able to break the Ukrainian momentum and sustain a stalemate for some time.\n\nPutin is unlikely to escalate to the tactical nuclear level if his forces manage to stabilize the battle lines. In that case, he would probably pursue his objectives through a war of attrition, continued efforts to impose a ceasefire, and attempts to divide NATO with calls for negotiations that would prevent Ukraine from recovering any more lost territory.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the United States and NATO should continue their successful policy of arms transfers to Kyiv, focusing on increased numbers of high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), long-range artillery, offensive drones, modern tanks, and armored fighting vehicles to retake lost territory. In addition, they should supply air-defense and counter-drone systems to deal with Russias attack on Ukrainian cities. They should continue to do their utmost to achieve a Ukrainian victoryat least the recovery of most territory occupied since February 24 while avoiding escalating to a NATO-Russian war. Despite Russian rhetoric about a \"proxy war\" with the United States and NATO, Putin is keen to avoid direct NATO involvement, especially given the decimation of Russian equipment and manpower.\n\nCan negotiations prevent further escalation?\n\nThe battlefield situation is not ripe for negotiations at this time. Russia has the largest incentive to establish a ceasefire that would allow it to retain Ukrainian territory it now occupies and that it risks losing to the Ukrainian counter-offensive.\n\nSince the Kharkiv offensive, Ukraine has been on a roll militarily and has little reason to negotiate given Russian brutality against civilians, rampant war crimes, and efforts to eradicate Ukrainian national identity. Ukraine has also shifted its declared war aims from recovering all territory occupied since February 24 to recapturing all territory lost since 2014, including Crimea. There is zero interest in Kyiv in giving Putin any concessions when Russia is still demanding Ukraines political subjugation and demilitarization. Washington has stated that it will leave it to Ukraine to decide if and when to negotiate, effectively letting Ukraine strengthen its negotiating leverage on the battlefield before sitting down at the negotiating table.\n\nIf Ukraine can recapture more territory quickly, without further Russian escalation, then negotiations may not be needed. However, the need for a negotiated solution might increase if Russia can create a stalemate on the battlefield. If Ukraine continues with its successful counter-offensives, Putin might seek to force negotiations on Kyiv by further escalating the conflict.\n\nThe history of the Cuban Missile Crisis teaches us that US President John F. Kennedy was able to negotiate the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba by showing strength with a military quarantine but also by providing Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev with a fig leaf, the removal of obsolete Jupiter missiles from Turkey. Should negotiations be required to end the Ukraine war, a similar formula may be needed.\n\nFor any negotiations to work, better channels of communication to the Kremlin will also be needed. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has just taken one important step in that direction with his recent phone conversations with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. More direct communications are needed to reduce the danger of unintended escalation.\n\nPossible options for Russian nuclear escalation\n\nPutin has threatened further escalation, implying that he might use nuclear weapons and stating that he is \"not bluffing.\" But Moscow has not indicated what the threshold for such escalation might beit may not know itselfand it may be a calculated bluff. Potential triggers for further escalation might include a Ukrainian victory in Kherson, additional successful Ukrainian military strikes or sabotage attacks in Crimea, the collapse or mass desertions of whole Russian military units in Ukraine, attacks on Russian cities by Ukrainian forces, the provision of long-range precision strike weapons to Ukraine by NATO, or the near-collapse of the Putin regime in Moscow.\n\nMany analysts expect that if Putin actually escalated to nuclear use, it would be either a demonstration shot over the Black Sea or a limited tactical strike against Ukrainian forces. That tactical strike (using a very low-yield device) might include one or several targets, depending on what Putin believes is required to force Kyivs capitulation. Few believe that Putin would strike a NATO country, since that would mean an instant, losing war with NATO. However, a strike against a city in Western Ukraine cannot be ruled out. His purpose would be to turn European and especially German opinion against further support for Ukraine and to convince Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he has no option but to accept a settlement on Russias terms.\n\nMore creative non-nuclear attacks should also not be ruled out: for example a dirty bomb (which Russia recently accused Ukraine of preparing to use in a false flag operation), a massive cyber strike, a limited poison gas attack against Ukrainian troops (as happened in Syria), the destruction of a major dam, or more severe attacks on a Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\n\nIs Putin bluffing?\n\nMany Western analysts believe that Putin is indeed bluffing with regard to nuclear use. They argue:\n\nA small tactical battlefield strike would have little military value since Ukrainian troops are generally dispersed and Ukraine would fight on.\n\nThe radiation would affect Russian as well as Ukrainian troops.\n\nPutins chain of command would stop him.\n\nPutin would back down because nuclear use is probably a red line for China and India, countries that Putin needs as friends for diplomatic and economic purposes.\n\nOthers take the nuclear threat more seriously. They argue:\n\n\"Escalate to deescalate\" (a strategy of limited nuclear strikes to force NATO to end a conventional conflict on Russian terms)has been the Russian doctrine for years.\n\nPutins purpose would be not to win on the battlefield but to freeze the battle and force a ceasefire or armistice on Russian terms.\n\nPutin has demonstrated his brutality in Chechnya, Syria, and Ukraine.\n\nIf Putin believes his regime or the viability of the Russian Federation is at stake, he will not hesitate to use any weapons available to him.\n\nPutin might believe that the Western coalition would crumble over a response.\n\nAssuming that Putin is bluffing is not sound policy. The West has consistently miscalculated that Putin does not mean what he says. Douglas London, a former Central Intelligence Agency operations officer for Russia, argues that as a former Cold War KGB operative, Putin will probably \"use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons if he believes doing so is the only means to preserve his power.\" Assuming that regime change in Moscow will solve the escalation problem is also not sound policy, since Putins successor is likely to have a similar KGB background and anti-Western world view.\n\nTaking the nuclear threat seriously does not mean withdrawing support for a Ukrainian victory or holding back on arms transfers. It does mean continuing to calculate the escalation risk of future NATO arms transfer decisions and to continue prudent planning about ways to deter and respond to such an attack.\n\nOptions for deterring and responding to nuclear use\n\nA prudent planner must hedge against and seek to deter the threat of nuclear use. Getting the deterrence balance right is critical. The response needs to be painful enough to deter but not certain enough to lock in the responder to any one course of action should deterrence fail.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to do this by publicly stating that there would be \"catastrophic consequences\" for Russia if it crossed the nuclear threshold. And it has privately provided some details about the nature of the US and Western response to leave Putin in no doubt that the costs of nuclear use, even a \"demonstration\" strike, would outweigh any benefits.\n\nAn array of responses to a nuclear strike (or use of any other weapons of mass destruction) would be available to NATO should deterrence fail. The mix would depend upon the nature of the Russian strike. The tools in ascending order of severity and risk might include the following.\n\nMeasures that would seek to punish Russia with limited risk of further nuclear escalation:\n\nSeeking unanimous diplomatic condemnation for nuclear use at the United Nations.\n\nRemoving Russia from international organizations.\n\nRemoving Russia completely from the SWIFT financial messaging system.\n\nImposing a full trade and financial embargo on Russia (with the support of China and India).\n\nUsing seized Russian financial assets for Ukrainian reconstruction.\n\nAgreeing on a date for Ukrainian membership in the European Union.\n\nMeasures that would punish Russia with some risk of further escalation:\n\nLifting the tacit limits on the provision to Ukraine of longer-range or more offensive weapons such as Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), F-16 fighter jets, and modern main battle tanks.\n\nAllowing Ukraine to use NATO long-range weapons to target areas in Russia.\n\nSending some NATO military advisors to Ukraine for non-combat missions.\n\nAgreeing on a date for Ukrainian membership in NATO.\n\nMeasures that would punish Russia with a higher risk of further escalation:\n\nAttacking Russian forces in Ukraine with NATO troops, for example destroying the site from which the Russian nuclear strike was launched.\n\nAttacking Russias Black Sea fleet with NATO aircraft.\n\nResponding with an in-kind NATO nuclear strike on a Russian military target in Ukraine.\n\nA prudent national security team would move carefully down this list, seeking ways to significantly punish Russia while maintaining escalation control. Allies may be reluctant to support an in-kind nuclear response, but for the sake of deterrence, NATO should preserve a measure of ambiguity about its readiness to use tactical nuclear weapons in some scenarios.\n\nHans Binnendijk is a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council.

                "cc_text": "Advertisement\n\nVladimir Putin has pulled out of an internationally-brokered deal to export grain after 'inventing a story' that the British Navy blew up the Nordstream gas supply pipeline and attacked Russian ships with suicide drones near Crimea.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence today accused the Russian president of fabricating the story to 'detract from the disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine', adding that the Kremlin is 'peddling false claims of an epic scale' after massive explosions rocked a key Crimean port.\n\nThe attacks saw Russia end the 'grain corridor' in retaliation after claiming that the ships that were targeted by Ukraine forces were involved in the deal to allow grain exports.\n\nBut Russia's decision to end the deal comes amid fears that Putin has been searching for an excuse to pull out and plunge third world countries into famine as part of his efforts to put pressure on Western countries to waver in their support of Ukraine. The country has also recently criticised the deal, saying its own grain exports have suffered due to Western sanctions.\n\nReacting to Russia's accusations, the MoD today said: 'To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale. This invented story, says more about arguments going on inside the Russian Government than it does about the west.'\n\nThe Turkey and UN-brokered deal to unlock grain exports signed between Russia and Ukraine in July is critical to easing the global food crisis caused by the conflict.\n\nThe agreement had already allowed more than nine million tonnes of Ukrainian grain to be exported and was due to be renewed on November 19.\n\nIn an earlier statement, Russia'a defence ministry said: 'In light of the terrorist act carried out by the Kyiv regime with the participation of British experts against ships of the Black Sea fleet and civilian vessels involved in the security of grain corridors, Russia suspends its participation in the implementation of the agreement on the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports.'\n\nThe Kremlin has now requested a UN Security Council meeting on Monday following the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's decision to suspend its participation in the grain agreement was today described by US President as outrageous.\n\nAnd Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky questioned how Russia can be a member of the G20 if it is 'deliberately trying to provoke starvation'. In a video address, he accused the Kremlin of trying to create an artificial famine in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nHe also called the move 'predictable', adding that Moscow has been 'blockading' ships carrying grain since September. Currently, he said, 176 vessels are backed up at sea, carrying more than two million tons of food.\n\nThe explosions of the Nord Stream pipelines in September caused four gas leaks. While the leaks were in international waters, two of them were in the Danish exclusive economic zone and two of them in the Swedish\n\nIncredible video footage from a Ukrainian underwater drone appears to show the Russian Black Sea flagship, Admiral Makarov\n\nThe exhilarating footage showed the underwater Ukrainian drone racing through the key naval port of Sevastopol - the largest city in Crimea\n\nThe underwater drones have been previously speculated as being involved in the explosion of the Kerch bridge in Crimea on October 8 - the day after Vladimir Putin's birthday\n\nUnconfirmed reports have suggested that frigate Admiral Makarov - the Black Sea Flagship - had been blown up (pictured)\n\nThe European Union is supporting UN-led efforts to keep the Ukraine grain deal alive, a spokesperson said on Saturday.\n\nNabila Massrali, spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy at the European Commission, said: We stress that all parties must refrain from any unilateral action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people around the world.'\n\nSevastopol in Moscow-annexed Crimea, which has been targeted several times in recent months, serves as the headquarters for the fleet and a logistical hub for operations in Ukraine.\n\nFurious Moscow forces alleged British 'specialists', whom they said were based in the southern Ukrainian city of Ochakiv, had helped prepare and train Kyiv to carry out the strike.\n\nIn a further singling out of the UK - which Moscow sees as one of the most unfriendly Western countries - Russia said the same British unit was involved in explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines last month. A claim refuted by British officials.\n\nExtraordinary footage has emerged showing Russian troops on board firing wildly at the drone as it races towards what is believed to be the Admiral Makarov frigate, which replaced the Moskva as the Black Sea Fleet's flagship.\n\nThe underwater Ukrainian drone can be seen racing through the key naval port of Sevastopol - the largest city in Crimea - while panicking Russian troops on ships and helicopters attempt to destroy it.\n\nThe exhilarating footage taken from a camera within the drone shows the underwater weapon riding through the waves and dodging bullets which can be seen penetrating the surface.\n\nA helicopter can then be seen racing into shot as desperate Russians attempt to respond before it continues to fire at the maritime drone.\n\nThe underwater drones have been previously speculated as being involved in the explosion of the Kerch bridge in Crimea on October 8 - the day after Vladimir Putin's birthday. In response to the bridge blast, Putin unleashed a barrage of missile strikes across Ukraine, striking civilian centres.\n\nMikhail Razvozhayev, the Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, said the drone attack was the 'most massive' the peninsula had seen. The city's services were on 'alert', but he claimed no 'civilian infrastructure' had been damaged.\n\nCity authorities said that the harbour was 'temporarily' closed to boats and ferries and urged people \"not to panic\".\n\nAttacks on Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, have increased in recent weeks, as Kyiv presses a counter-offensive in the south to retake territory held by Moscow for months.\n\nMoscow-installed authorities in Kherson, just north of Crimea, have vowed to turn the city into a fortress, preparing for an inevitable assault.\n\nOn Thursday, Razvozhayev said a thermal power station had been attacked in Balaklava, in the Sevastopol area. He claimed there was only minor damage and no casualties.\n\nIt comes on a day which has seen Russia seek revenge for a drone attack that hit Sevastopol in the early hours of the morning.\n\nRussian Black Sea warships were forced to fight Kyiv forces in an attack that Russian Ministry of Defence branded a 'terrorist attack'. Moscow claimed that they destroyed nine aerial drones and seven maritime drones.\n\nMikhail Razvozhayev, Russian governor of Sevastopol, said the attack in the early hours of the morning caused no damage to city infrastructure but later the Ministry of Defence conceded that at least one vessel sustained minor damage.\n\nA second video showed a massive explosion after Ukrainian forces attacked the naval port in Crimea, sending Russia into disarray\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defence conceded that at least one Russian vessel was damaged in the attacks - thought to be the flagship\n\nAlthough Ukraine has not confirmed these attacks, Kyiv sources claim that several of the Russian ships from the fleet were blown up, including the frigate Admiral Makarov.\n\nBefore Russia halted the grain deal, the Ministry had threatened on Telegram: 'It should be emphasised that the ships of the Black Sea Fleet that were subjected to the terrorist attack are involved in ensuring the security of the 'grain corridor' as part of an international initiative to export agricultural products from Ukrainian ports.'\n\nBritain strongly rebutted claims they were involved, saying 'the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.'\n\nThe British defence ministry said that this 'invented story says more about arguments going on inside the Russian Government than it does about the West'.\n\nEarlier today Razvozhayev said: 'Black Sea Fleet ships are fighting off a drone attack in Sevastopol Bay.' he said.\n\n'No damage has been reported in the city. The situation is under control. All response services are at the ready.'\n\nA student dormitory at an art college near the port saw 'one windowpane burst' but 'no harm was done', he added.\n\nResidents claimed that the huge explosions 'shook' their homes and windows while black smoke was seen rising from the docks area.\n\nDramatic footage purportedly showed a Moscow attack helicopter destroying an 'underwater drone' in Omega Bay.\n\nThe video showed the helicopter hovering above the object in the water before it bursts into flames with smoke billowing out of it.\n\nThe underwater object thought to be a drone was said to be tailing a warship before it was reportedly destroyed by the Russian helicopter.\n\nMissiles were fired from the helicopter which also unleashed volleys of machine gun fire.\n\nRussian sources claimed its air defenced deployed from naval warships were forced to repel a sustained Ukrainian attack that started at 4.30am and lasted for at least five hours.\n\nAt least one Russian warship was damaged during a 'massive' Ukrainian drone assault as huge explosions rocked a key Crimean port, the Moscow Ministry of Defence revealed\n\nDramatic footage showed a Moscow attack helicopter destroying an 'underwater drone' in Omega Bay earlier this afternoon\n\nThe Kremlin has also blamed a US Global Hawk (RQ-4B) which 'flew from Italy' for flying over the Black Sea and monitoring Russian responses to the concerted Ukrainian onslaught.\n\nAll passenger ferry services were suspended in the strategic port which is the HQ of Putin's Black Sea Fleet.\n\nIt marks what could be the most audacious attack so far by Ukraine on Russian naval assets in Sevastopol.\n\nEarlier this week, Razvozhayev said that a drone had attacked a thermal power station near Sevastopol.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian fleet stationed in the port had also been attacked by a drone in July.\n\nSo far, attempts to verify Razvozhayev's claims that no damage has been done have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe Russian statesman begged locals not to post footage of the attacks, claiming that it could aid the Kyiv regime.\n\n'A big request is not to write what-where-how much you saw and heard,' he posted.\n\n'And do not upload videos. It should be clear to everyone that such data is very necessary for the UkroNazis in order to understand how the defence of our city is arranged.'\n\nAccording to Ukrainian sources, several of the Russian ships from the fleet were blown up in the early hours of Saturday morning\n\nLocal media were reporting that rescuers in the late morning were still attempting to put out a fire on one of the ships\n\nPlumes of smoke were visible after Ukrainian drone strikes in the middle of the night - Russia say they had to destroy nine drones and seven maritime drones\n\nMassive explosions have been seen hitting a key naval port in annexed Crimea that Russia claim was targeted in a major Ukrainian drone assault\n\nMikhail Razvozhayev, Russian governor of Sevastopol, said: 'No damage has been reported in the city.\n\nHowever, this did not fail to prevent residents reporting the explosions that unfolded in the middle of the nights.\n\nOne resident reported: 'Woke up at 4 a.m. to a massive explosion. Thank goodness it's [our] air defences.\n\n'Our ships in Sevastopol Bay were repelling a drone attack.\n\n'It was a fun night, even very fun.'\n\nAnother stated: 'Woke up to an explosion at 5:30am. Followed some time later by three more'.\n\nA third added: 'Ten minutes ago three explosions sounded, and shook the house'\n\nMeanwhile, another comment said: 'Woke up this morning to explosions.\n\n'Never heard anything like that before. It thundered so hard that the windows shook in the flat.'\n\nThe attack comes as Russia appears to have largely given up attacking Ukraine and has been forced on to the defensive after Putin's military got mauled by Kyiv's armies.\n\nEarlier this week, Razvozhayev (pictured) said that a drone had attacked a thermal power station near Sevastopol\n\nRussia also blamed a US Global Hawk (RQ-4B) which 'flew from Italy' for flying over the Black Sea and monitoring Russian responses to the concerted Ukrainian onslaught\n\nRussian troops have been forced on to the defensive across almost the entire frontline in Ukraine after Putin's army was mauled, British intelligence said yesterday\n\nSeverely undermanned and poorly trained Russian units have stopped advancing across most of the front line in the last six weeks, British intelligence said yesterday.\n\nUkrainian forces advance in both the north and south of the country - pushing east from Kharkiv into Luhansk and advancing towards Kherson.\n\nIn Kherson, companies of soldiers which should consist of 100 men were fighting with just six to eight troops each, Ministry of Defence analysts added.\n\nWhile Putin is attempting to bolster these units with conscripted troops, Russia is unlikely to be able to resume its offensive in the near future.\n\nEarlier this week, it had appeared that Russia was preparing to withdraw from Kherson city but Ukraine now believes Putin is actually reinforcing it.\n\nKyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence service, said earlier this week that Russia has been evacuating civilians but is moving military reinforcements into urban areas, preparing defences, and plans to fight for the city.\n\nHe added that the evacuation and talk of a retreat by Russia's top commander may have been an effort to lure Ukraine into a costly urban battle.",

The strategic importance of cities such as Kherson has been highlighted by the ongoing conflict, with Ukrainian resistance persisting despite early losses (5).\n\nThe broader implications of the war include shifts in global defense strategies, with the United States concluding its two-decade war in Afghanistan and refocusing on countering near-peer competitors such as Russia (6). Economically, the conflict has affected countries worldwide, with Asia experiencing increased inflation and the IMF marking down Chinese growth due to the war and other factors (7). Russia's political timeline also intersects with the conflict, as the 2024 election looms and questions about the country's standing and alliances persist (8). The war is seen by key decision-makers as a critical struggle with global consequences, and the risk of escalation remains a concern (9). Furthermore, the conflict has impacted Central Asian economies through remittances from Russia, illustrating the interconnectedness of regional economies and the unpredictability of future risks (10)."

Despite internal Russian criticisms of the Kremlin's handling of the war and the construction of defensive positions like the \"Wagner Line\" by Prigozhin, Ukraine has continued to assert its military objectives (4).",
                "more_detailed": "Since the beginning of the war, Ukraine's military strategy has undergone significant evolution, adapting to the changing dynamics on the battlefield and the broader geopolitical environment. Initially focused on defending territory against Russian advances, Ukraine has shifted its declared war aims from merely recovering territory occupied since February 24 to recapturing all lands lost since 2014, including Crimea (2). This change in strategy comes as Ukraine experiences military successes, such as the Kharkiv offensive, which have bolstered its position and reduced its incentive to negotiate, especially given Russian aggression and war crimes (2). Moreover, the Ukrainian forces have adopted an increasingly cautious strategy, advancing in small groups only after identifying breaches in Russian defenses, a reflection of both strategic prudence and the reality of manpower shortages (6).\n\nIn response to Ukrainian advances and its own battlefield losses, Russia has mobilized additional forces and escalated its attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure (5,9). Despite this, Russian President Vladimir Putin faces criticism from within Russia for the lack of progress in the war, as well as international condemnation for the implied threats of nuclear weapons use (3,9). Ukraine's military, reinforced by international support and a clear understanding of the high stakes involved, continues to press on, with the aim of not just resisting Russian aggression but also reclaiming lost territories, a stance that has been strengthened by the international community's reaffirmation of support for Ukraine's sovereignty (3,7)."

Global energy trends have also been affected this year by the impacts of Russias war on the world economy, which have significantly dampened expectations for economic growth, notably in Europe.

Ukraine's economy has been devastated by the conflict, with a significant GDP contraction, massive refugee displacement, and reliance on Western financial support to cover government deficits (3). For Russia, the threat of increased sanctions, including a potential full economic, financial, and trade embargo comparable to those on Iran or North Korea, looms if nuclear weapons are used, which could severely isolate its economy (4). Additionally, the loss of strategic territories like Kherson would not only undermine Russia's military objectives but also deal a significant blow to its economy (5).",
                "more_detailed": "The Russia-Ukraine war has led to significant global economic repercussions, particularly in the domains of energy and agriculture, with prices for these commodities experiencing considerable increases (1). The conflict has not only caused a surge in commodity prices but also contributed to the deterioration of terms of trade and currency depreciations across many Asian countries, leading to tighter financial conditions within the region (2). Moreover, the war has devastated Ukraine's economy, shrinking its GDP by roughly one-third and resulting in substantial government deficits, mainly financed by Western grants (3). The potential for a nuclear incident has prompted discussions on imposing more severe sanctions on Russia, which would involve a full economic, financial, and trade embargo, further isolating the country internationally (4).\n\nOn a broader scale, the war has intensified a global energy crisis, with natural gas prices reaching record highs and subsequently driving up electricity costs in some markets (7). This crisis has prompted shifts towards renewable energy sources and electric vehicles, somewhat mitigating the rise in global CO2 emissions (8). The international community's response to the conflict includes forming coalitions to reinforce sanctions, freezing Russian central bank assets, and contemplating the use of seized Russian financial assets for Ukrainian reconstruction (6,10). The crisis has also sparked discussions about the acceleration of Ukraine's integration with European structures, including potential EU membership (10). Collectively, these economic impacts and strategic responses underscore the profound and lasting implications of the Russia-Ukraine war on the global economy."

Some US officials and commentators have advocated for direct diplomacy and a compromise similar to historical precedents like the Cuban Missile Crisis, while others emphasize the importance of Ukrainian victory as a prerequisite for diplomacy and the eventual conclusion of war (6,7).

The Ukrainian military has continued their counteroffensives in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, aiming to regain control over occupied areas (6). Moreover, to protect vital infrastructure, Ukraine has had to redistribute its air defense systems away from the front lines to shield power facilities from Russian attacks, demonstrating a strategic reallocation of resources in the face of new threats (8). This reallocation, however, has created a gap in their defenses, as they currently lack sufficient air defense systems to cover all necessary areas, giving Russia a temporary advantage in air attacks (8). Despite this, Ukraine remains determined in its defense and has been receiving ongoing support from the West, including the provision of weapons and defense systems to bolster its capabilities against Russian aggression (9)."

Therefore, easing the situation in Ukraine via diplomacy instead of cruel military means to avoid US resources from being further consumed fits the interests of the Democratic Party and the US.Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times that at the beginning, the progressives inside the Democratic Party had not voiced strong opposition to Biden's support of Ukraine, either out of the so-called shared values, hostility toward Russia or obligations to allies. But as the conflict continues, the negative impact on the US economy has driven them to suggest Biden change course.Xu Liang, an associate professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing International Studies University, believes that the letter signed by some progressives reflects the fact that inside the US, there are people who do not want the US to be dragged in the mud of war for long. However, the criticism the letter had drawn and its retraction show that in the US, \"political correctness\" dominates.For the US, it is politically correct to support Ukraine and sanction Russia.",

                "less_detailed": "The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 dramatically escalated pre-existing tensions and sparked a global energy crisis, with record-high natural gas prices impacting electricity markets worldwide (3). The conflict intensified as Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Ukrainian counter-offensives with a strategy of escalation, raising concerns over further aggression, including the potential use of nuclear weapons (4).",
                "summary": "The Ukraine-Russia crisis escalated into a full-scale war due to several contributing factors. Initially, the rapid economic recovery post-pandemic led to tightening energy markets, which were further exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, causing a global energy crisis with soaring natural gas prices and electricity costs (3). The situation deteriorated as Russian President Vladimir Putin employed escalation as a strategic response to Ukrainian counter-offensives, which had begun to reverse Russian advances (4). Despite the international community's efforts to prevent nuclear escalation and Russia's military setbacks, the Biden administration maintained a stance of non-engagement with Putin, insisting that peace negotiations were contingent on Ukraine's decision, even in the face of international pressure for diplomatic solutions (5).",
                "more_detailed": "The Ukraine-Russia crisis escalated into a full-scale war in 2022 primarily due to Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine. This act of aggression was carried out despite Kremlin's previous denials of any plans to invade, thus proving their assurances unreliable (9). The invasion caused a spike in global commodities prices, affecting terms of trade and currency values in Asia, and had a direct impact on global energy markets by driving the price of natural gas to record highs, thereby exacerbating a global energy crisis that had been tightening since 2021 (1,3). The conflict further strained international relations, with Russian President Vladimir Putin employing escalation as a cornerstone strategy, particularly in the face of Ukrainian counter-offensives that rolled back Russian gains (4).\n\nAs the war continued, Putin resorted to implied threats of nuclear weapons use, a move that was met with unified support for Ukraine by the United States, G7 nations, NATO, and the EU, all of whom condemned the Russian aggression and its threats to global security (6,7). The use of such brinksmanship tactics by Russia, alongside the economic impacts of the conflict, including disruptions in remittances for countries reliant on Russia and significant uncertainties for global economies, revealed the multifaceted reasons behind the escalation of the crisis into a major conflict in 2022 (7,8). The international community's response to the invasion and the subsequent economic sanctions on Russia further intensified the situation, confirming the war's transition from a regional crisis to a significant geopolitical event with worldwide repercussions (2,5,6,7)."

                "cc_text": "The chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus said Tuesday the group had retracted a letter that asked President Joe Biden to directly engage with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nProgressives retracted the letter, which was sent Monday, after their effort to press Biden to take a more aggressive strategy on Ukraine was met with intense pushback from fellow Democrats and some Ukrainians.\n\nIn a statement announcing the retraction, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the caucus chair, blamed the release of the letter on a staff error.\n\n\"The letter was drafted several months ago, but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting,\" Jayapal said. \"As chair of the caucus, I accept responsibility for this.\n\n\"Because of the timing, our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican Leader McCarthy threatening an end to aid to Ukraine if Republicans take over,\" Jayapal continued, referring to a statement by Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., that if Republicans win back the House majority next month, they would not write \"a blank check\" to the country.\n\n\"The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance that Democrats, who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of military, strategic, and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people, are somehow aligned with Republicans who seek to pull the plug on American support for President Zelensky and the Ukrainian forces,\" she added.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who signed the letter, said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that he was \"glad to learn\" of its withdrawal, saying the letter had led to \"the conflation of growing Republican opposition to support for Ukraine\" with \"the polar-opposite position of dozens of Democrats like me who have passionately supported every package of military, strategic and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people and are determined to see the Ukrainian people win victory over Vladimir Putin and expel his imperialist forces from their country.\"\n\n\"In the eight months since Russia began its atrocity-filled and illegal war of aggression against the people of Ukraine, the Ukrainian people have given Americans not just the chance to defend the values of national sovereignty, democracy and pluralism but also great hope for the worlds future,\" he said.\n\nIn their letter, the lawmakers had asked Biden to pair the military and financial support the U.S. has provided to Ukraine with a \"proactive diplomatic push\" that involved direct talks with Russia. Republicans have threatened to cut aid to Ukraine if they retake control of the House in the midterm elections next month.\n\n\"If there is a way to end the war while preserving a free and independent Ukraine, it is Americas responsibility to pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine,\" the letter reads. \"Such a framework would presumably include incentives to end hostilities, including some form of sanctions relief, and bring together the international community to establish security guarantees for a free and independent Ukraine that are acceptable for all parties, particularly Ukrainians.\"\n\nThe progressive Democrats warned Biden that the \"alternative to diplomacy is protracted war, with both its attendant certainties and catastrophic and unknowable risks.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has resisted engaging with Putin to end the conflict, saying it is up to Kyiv to decide whether it wants to negotiate with Russia.\n\nThe letter acknowledges difficulties in engaging with Russia, criticizing its \"outrageous and illegal invasion of Ukraine\" and \"illegal annexations.\" The progressives then argue that the U.S. has a responsibility to \"pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine.\"\n\n\"As legislators responsible for the expenditure of tens of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars in military assistance in the conflict, we believe such involvement in this war also creates a responsibility for the United States to seriously explore all possible avenues, including direct engagement with Russia, to reduce harm and support Ukraine in achieving a peaceful settlement,\" the letter reads.\n\nNumerous Democrats criticized the letter, which was signed by 30 lawmakers and led by Jayapal. The backlash prompted Jayapal to release a statement \"clarifying\" the groups position.\n\n\"Let me be clear: We are united as Democrats in our unequivocal commitment to supporting Ukraine in their fight for their democracy and freedom in the face of the illegal and outrageous Russian invasion, and nothing in the letter advocates for a change in that support,\" Jayapal said. \"Diplomacy is an important tool that can save lives but it is just one tool. As we also made explicitly clear in our letter and will continue to make clear, we support President Biden and his administrations commitment to nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"\n\nSome who signed the letter also appeared to distance themselves from it. Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., said in a statement that \"only Ukrainians have a right to determine the terms by which this war ends.\" Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., criticized the timing of the move and claimed in a series of tweets Monday night that the letter was written over the summer.\n\n\"First, this was written in July & I have no idea why it went out now. Bad timing. Second, it was trying to get to a cease-fire & diplomacy as others were banging war drums, not criticizing Biden. Third, Ive supported the efforts & will continue. Over analyzed by some,\" Pocan wrote in response to a Twitter user.\n\nAnother lawmaker who signed the letter, Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., said on Twitter, \"Timing in diplomacy is everything,\" adding that she signed the letter at the end of June and that \"a lot has changed since then.\"\n\n\"I wouldnt sign it today,\" she said. \"We have to continue supporting Ukraine economically and militarily to give them the leverage they need to end this war.\"\n\nInna Sovsun, a member of Ukraine's Parliament, also criticized the move, saying on Twitter that she was \"deeply troubled\" by it.\n\n\"You cant negotiate with terrorists when they continue to kill,\" Sovsun wrote.\n\nIn response to the letter, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that although the administration \"appreciates their very thoughtful concerns,\" it will not hold \"conversations with the Russian leadership without the Ukrainians being represented.\"\n\n\"Mr. Zelenskyy gets to determine because its his country what success looks like and when to negotiate,\" Kirby told reporters at a briefing. \"Wed all like to see this war end today, and quite frankly it could end today if Putin did the right thing and pulled his troops out.\"",

                "cc_text": "WASHINGTON The Biden administration laid out a national defense strategy aimed at China, which it views as Americas most consequential strategic competitor, and Russia, which it sees as an \"acute threat\" capable of cyber and missile attacks on the U.S.\n\nThe administrations first National Defense Strategy highlights Beijings growing military strength as well as its provocative rhetoric and coercive activity toward Taiwan as part of a broader pattern across the Asia-Pacific region. The 80-page unclassified version comes six months after it was sent to Capitol Hill and two weeks after the White House released its long overdue National Security Strategy.\n\n\"The NDS bluntly describes Russia as an acute threat, and we chose the word acute carefully,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters. \"Unlike China, Russia cant systemically challenge the United States over the long term, but Russian aggression does pose an immediate and sharp threat to our interests and values. And [Russian President Vladimir] Putins reckless war of choice against Ukraine, the worst threat to European security since the end of World War II, has made that very clear for the whole world.\"\n\nPentagon officials said they did not substantively change the strategy, which was completed in March, in response to Russias 8-month-old invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the U.S. has sent more than $17 billion in military aid to Ukraine, the fight has severely degraded Russian forces and Moscow is threatening to employ nuclear weapons.\n\nA senior Pentagon official told reporters there was \"overlap\" between how the Pentagon is meeting challenges from both countries, particularly through investments in cyber, space and undersea capabilities, among others. \"I like to think of it as the two for one, if you will,\" the official said.\n\nThe Pentagon is dealing with Russias threats to escalate the war in Ukraine, Chinas reaffirmation of threats to annex Taiwan by force, an increasing alignment between the two, and mounting nuclear concerns from North Korea and Iran.\n\nThe Ukraine crisis delayed the rollout of the White Houses overarching National Security Strategy, which was released Oct. 12. The administration initially planned to release the strategy in February; that delay also encompassed the defense strategy.\n\nThe National Defense Strategys centerpiece is \"integrated deterrence,\" or coordinating military, diplomatic and economic levers from across the U.S. government to deter an adversary from taking an aggressive action. But it also stresses \"campaigning\" to build up the capability of international coalitions and complicate adversaries actions.\n\nIt also calls for making \"the right technology investments\" as it points to new threats from space weapons, tactical nuclear weapons, and new applications of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. Along with investments in directed-energy and hypersonic weapons, the strategy says it would be a \"fast-follower\" where market forces are driving commercialization of capabilities the military would use, like artificial intelligence, autonomy and renewable energy.\n\nNuclear competition\n\nThe Nuclear Posture Review, also released Thursday, emphasizes the need to modernize nuclear forces and highlights the dilemma of deterring two nuclear-armed competitors, Russia and China. It emphasizes the need to maintain robust nuclear command, control and communications through satellites and cyberspace.\n\nBiden came to office championing nuclear weapons reduction, and the strategy stresses efforts to reduce the role of nuclear weapons. But administration officials acknowledged that arms control efforts have been stymied by Chinas refusal to participate.\n\nA Yars intercontinental ballistic missile is fired as part of Russia's nuclear drills from a launch site in Plesetsk, northwestern Russia. (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP)\n\nThough the document calls for the B83-1 nuclear gravity bomb to be retired and development of the sea-launched cruise missile to be halted, Congress appears poised to preserve the latter, amid support from top generals, through the 2023 defense policy bill. The administration is yet to decide on how it will approach its plan to retire the B83.\n\nAdministration officials previewing the strategy said the sea-launched cruise missile and gravity bomb had been deemed unnecessary after broad consultations in and outside the Defense Department.\n\nWhen asked what message Putin would receive from any move to scuttle the nuclear-armed SLCM, Austin defended the U.S. nuclear arsenals ability to deter Russia.\n\n\"As you know, our inventory of nuclear weapons is significant. And so we determined, as we looked at our inventory, that that you know, we did not need that capability,\" Austin said of the SLCM-N. \"We have a lot of capability in our nuclear inventory, and I dont think that sends any message to Putin. He understands what our capability is.\"\n\nGlobal deployments\n\nThe strategys force-planning construct aims for the ability to respond to short, small-scale crises without substantially impairing its readiness for high-end conflicts with Russia and China.\n\n\"Our force posture will focus on the access and warfighting requirements that enable our efforts to deter potential PRC [Peoples Republic of China] and Russian aggression against vital U.S. national interests, and to prevail in conflict if deterrence fails,\" according to the document.\n\nThat will include investments in cyber, space and undersea capabilities in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific region, a senior defense official said, as well as exercises in those areas.\n\nU.S. soldiers work in the Joint Cyber Control Center during Operation Deuce Lightning with German soldiers and airmen. (Lawrence Torres III/U.S. Army)\n\n\"And so as we understand our posture, how do we make sure that we dont just think about sort of folks on the ground, which is just our more traditional view, but, for example, in our space capabilities?\" the official said.\n\nThough officials have been mum on any negotiations about changing the mix of forward-deployed and rotating troops abroad, defense officials in recent years have put both of those possibilities on the table.\n\n\"My advice would be to create permanent bases, but dont permanently station,\" Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee in April. \"So you get the effect of permanence by rotational forces cycling through permanent bases.\"\n\nAt the time, the U.S. had mobilized roughly 20,000 troops to Europe in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine, calling into question whether a more robust presence in Europe would be necessary going forward.\n\nIn the preceding years, the Army had closed some of its permanent garrisons in Germany and replaced that posture with heel-to-toe rotational deployments.\n\nAnd in Asia, the discussion of whether tens of thousands of permanently based troops in Japan and South Korea is the best way to deter China and North Korea has continued.\n\nIn 2021, the Army announced it would move an artillery headquarters from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state to South Korea, while a previously rotational attack helicopter presence would also be permanently based in South Korea.\n\n\"I dont think were looking to have fixed bases in fixed places, right?\" a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official told reporters in 2020. \"I think thats, one, too expensive. Two, I think that you rely, then, on all of the agreements that you have to have to do that, and time.\"\n\n\"The Department is establishing a new framework for strategic readiness, enabling a more comprehensive, data-driven assessment and reporting of readiness to ensure greater alignment with NDS priorities,\" the new document reads, but the senior defense official didnt offer any details on what that should look like.\n\nThe strategy itself describes an approach where ships, aircraft and other capabilities will be deployed, keeping in mind that they must be preserved long enough to have a clean handoff when new technology goes operational, with no gaps in availability.\n\nJoe Gould was the senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News, covering the intersection of national security policy, politics and the defense industry.

He pledged his military would improve on an already good record of downing missiles with help from its partners.\n\nWith the war about to start its ninth month and winter approaching, the potential for freezing misery loomed as Russia continued to attack Ukraine's power grid.\n\nIn Kherson, a target for Ukraine's aggressive counterattack to the invasion Russian President Vladimir Putin launched on February 24, the occupation authorities instructed civilians to get out.\n\n\"Due to the tense situation at the front, the increased danger of massive shelling of the city and the threat of terrorist attacks, all civilians must immediately leave the city and cross to the (east) bank of the Dnipro!\" occupation authorities posted on Telegram.\n\nThousands of civilians have left Kherson after warnings of a Ukrainian offensive to recapture the city.\n\nAt Oleshky on the opposite bank of the Dnipro, Reuters saw people arriving by river boat from Kherson, loaded with boxes, bags and pets. One woman carried a toddler under one arm and a dog under the other.\n\n3:37am: G7 condemns Russia's kidnapping of Ukraine nuclear plant leadership\n\nThe G7 condemned Russia's kidnapping of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant leadership and called for the immediate return of full control of the plant to Ukraine.\n\n\"We condemn Russia's repeated kidnapping of Ukrainian ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant) leadership and staff,\" G7 Nonproliferation Directors General said in a statement dated Saturday.\n\n\"We urge Russia to immediately return full control of the ZNPP to its rightful sovereign owner, Ukraine,\" it said.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AP, AFP and REUTERS)\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

                "cc_text": "IMF Launches Regional Economic Outlook Report for Asia and Pacific: Sailing into Headwinds\n\nDespite being a relative bright spot in an increasingly dimming global economy, Asias growth is expected to slow amid headwinds from global financial tightening, the war in Ukraine, and the sharp and uncharacteristic slowdown in the Chinese economy.\n\nAsias policymakers face worsening trade-offs but should remain steadfast on monetary tightening to tame rising inflation, fiscal consolidation to stabilize debt, and pre-emptively address emerging stability risks through the full use of its policy toolkit.\n\nGiven its strong trade and supply-chain links, Asia has a lot to lose in the event of sharp fragmentation scenarios where the world divides into separate trading blocs.\n\nSingapore: Growth in the Asia and Pacific region is expected to slow down in 2022 and 2023, reflecting headwinds from global financial tightening, the war in Ukraine, and the sharp and uncharacteristic slowdown of the Chinese economy. This challenging conjuncture poses difficult trade-offs for policymakers, said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and the Pacific.\n\n\"Asias strong economic rebound early this year is losing momentum, with a weaker-than-expected second quarter. We have cut growth forecasts for Asia and the Pacific to 4 percent this year and 4.3 percent next yeardown by 0.9 and 0.8 percentage points, respectively, compared to the April World Economic Outlookwhich are well below the 5.5 percent average over the last two decades. Despite this, Asia remains a relative bright spot in an increasingly dimming global economy,\" noted Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the IMFs Asia and Pacific Department.\n\nThe region faces three formidable headwinds, which may prove to be persistent. The first headwind is global financial tightening. The Federal Reserve has become much more aggressive in tightening their monetary policy as US inflation remains stubbornly high. This has translated into tighter financial conditions for Asia.\n\nThe second headwind is the war in Ukraine. The main impact on Asia has been through commodities prices, which spiked following the invasion and have remained high. Mostbut not allcountries in Asia have seen a deterioration of their terms of trade, and this has been an important factor behind currency depreciations so far this year.\n\nThe third headwind is the sharp and uncharacteristic slowdown in China. The IMF has marked down Chinese growth for 2022 to 3.2 percent, its second-lowest level since 1977, reflecting the impact of the zero-COVID lockdowns on mobility and the crisis in the real estate sector. This slowdown is estimated to have important spillovers to the rest of Asia through trade and financial links.\n\nWhile inflation rose more modestly in Asia during 2021 than it did in other regions, the sharp bout of volatility in global commodity markets after Russias invasion of Ukraine in February put additional pressure on Asias headline inflation in the first half of 2022. This increase has been driven by rising food and fuel pricesparticularly in Asian emerging market and developing economiesbut also reflects higher core inflation as the region recovers.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Mr. Srinivasan stressed several priorities for policymakers: \"Further tightening of monetary policy will be required to ensure that inflation returns to target and inflation expectations remain well anchored. Fiscal consolidation is needed to stabilize public debt and support the monetary policy stance. Asia is now the largest debtor in the world besides being the biggest saver, and several countries are at high risk of debt distress. Public and private debt dynamics are already worse following the pandemic because of slower growth and higher debt levels. Depreciations and rising interest rates could expose financial vulnerabilities from high leverage and unhedged balance sheets, and further raise public debt ratios. As interest rates rise, this will raise the fiscal balance needed to stabilize debt. An integrated approach to tackling these challenges in a timely and well-calibrated way is of the essence while being mindful of the further downside risks.\n\n\"The challenging conjuncture is aggravating the medium-term economic scars opened by the pandemic. The pandemic is expected to provoke a long-term fall in output with respect to pre-pandemic projections, and this scarring is expected to be worst in Asia and Pacific. Much of the shortfall in growth in Asia relative to other regions can be explained by lower levels of investment following the pandemic. These output losses are also particularly severe in tourism-dependent economies and those with high debt.\n\n\"While exact policy responses will depend on country-specific circumstances, tackling corporate debt overhang and mitigating human capital losses will be important for a wide range of countries in the region.\n\n\"The prospect of greater geo-economic fragmentation also poses a significant risk to the region. In the report, we document worrying early signs of fragmentation, with trade policy uncertainty spiking and countries imposing more trade restrictions. Even in the absence of actual restrictions, greater trade policy uncertainty can have adverse macroeconomic consequences in the short term. A typical shock to trade policy uncertainty, like the 2018 buildup of U.S.-China tensions, reduces investment by about 3.5 percent after two years.\n\n\"The report considers an illustrative sharp fragmentation scenario in which the world divides into separate trading blocs, and shows it would carry large, permanent output losses. These could be especially severe for Asia, given its significant role in global manufacturing and trade. Just the losses due to lower productivity could take up to 3.3 percentage points off regional output. Total losses are likely much larger due to the dent on investment as firms lose access to export markets.\n\n\"We therefore stress the need for international cooperation to roll back trade restrictions, reduce policy uncertainty, and promote open and stable trade both regionally and globally to avoid the most harmful fragmentation scenarios, and to ensure that trade continues to act as an engine of growth.\"",

But it would be a serious mistake.\"\n\nINSPECTORS\n\nBritain's Deputy UN Ambassador James Kariuki told reporters: \"This is pure Russian misinformation of the kind of we've seen many times before and it should stop.\"\n\nRussia's defence ministry said the aim of a dirty bomb attack by Ukraine would be to blame Moscow for the radioactive contamination, which it said Russia had begun preparing for.\n\nIn an apparent response to Moscow's allegation, the UN nuclear watchdog said it was preparing to send inspectors to two unidentified Ukrainian sites at Kyiv's request, both already subject to its inspections.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters the inspectors would receive full access, and he called on Moscow to demonstrate the same transparency as Ukraine.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA has identified what it said were the two sites involved - the Eastern Mineral Enrichment Plant in the central Dnipropetrovsk region and the Institute for Nuclear Research in Kyiv.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has not spoken publicly about the dirty bomb allegations but on Tuesday said Russia needed to streamline decision-making in what it calls its \"special military operation\" to rid its neighbour of extremists. Ukraine and its allies accuse Moscow of an unprovoked war to grab territory.\n\nPutin, speaking at the first meeting of a new council to manage the government's work, said increased coordination of government structures and regions was necessary.\n\nMORE HELP FOR UKRAINE?\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday on his first visit since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 as Berlin hosted what it said was a conference on a \"Marshall Plan\" to rebuild Ukraine, a reference to the US initiative to rebuild Western Europe at the end of World War Two.\n\nThousands have been killed, and homes and factories destroyed, since Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSince Russian forces suffered major defeats in September, Putin has doubled down, calling up hundreds of thousands of reservists, announcing the annexation of occupied territory and repeatedly threatening to use nuclear weapons.\n\nSteinmeier said Berlin was working to help Ukraine with air defence equipment and would focus on assisting with repairs to infrastructure such as power grids before winter arrives.\n\nZelenskiy told the Berlin conference via video link that Russian rockets and Iranian-made drones had destroyed more than a third of his country's energy sector, but that Kyiv had yet to receive \"a single cent\" for a recovery plan worth $17 billion.\n\nThe European Commission urged EU countries and companies to donate more to Ukraine's energy sector.\n\n\"When we win this war, history will remember those who stood by our side in our darkest hour as well as those who openly supported the aggressor,\" the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said in a tweet. \"But most of all, it will remember those who stood idly by and pretended they didn't see a genocide happening in the middle of Europe.\"\n\nIn southern Ukraine, Russia has ordered civilians in Kherson to evacuate territory it controls on the western bank of the Dnipro River, where Ukrainian forces have been advancing this month after Russia claimed to have annexed the area.\n\nA defeat for Russia there would be one of its biggest setbacks in the conflict.\n\nA Reuters reporter in a remote hamlet near part of the Kherson frontline heard neither artillery nor shooting.\n\nResidents in the village, which cannot be identified under Ukrainian military regulations, said they hoped Russian forces who had shelled them in the past would soon withdraw.\n\n\"You fall asleep at night and you don't know if you will wake up,\" said Mikola Nizinets, 39, as dozens of villagers waited to collect water, food packets and simple wood-burning stoves delivered by aid volunteers.\n\nWith no power or gas and little food or potable water in the area, many residents have fled, abandoning cattle to roam among expended munitions poking from the soil.",

Footage was also broadcast of remarks he gave via videolink to a conference of regional intelligence services in which he doubled down on his accusations of a Ukrainian dirty bomb plot.\n\nHe also repeated other baseless allegations made by Russia in recent months against Ukraine, including that it had been turned by the US into a \"testing ground for military biological experiments\".\n\nUkrainian Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Wednesday that \"my personal opinion is that Putin won't use nukes\". Separately, he told US TV that Ukraine's counter-offensive in the south had been hampered by rainy weather.\n\nIn an address to the nation in September, Mr Putin said his country had \"various weapons of destruction\" and would \"use all the means available to us\", adding: \"I'm not bluffing.\"",

                "cc_text": "Energy markets began to tighten in 2021 because of a variety of factors, including the extraordinarily rapid economic rebound following the pandemic. But the situation escalated dramatically into a full-blown global energy crisis following Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The price of natural gas reached record highs, and as a result so did electricity in some markets. Oil prices hit their highest level since 2008.\n\nHigher energy prices have contributed to painfully high inflation, pushed families into poverty, forced some factories to curtail output or even shut down, and slowed economic growth to the point that some countries are heading towards severe recession. Europe, whose gas supply is uniquely vulnerable because of its historic reliance on Russia, could face gas rationing this winter, while many emerging economies are seeing sharply higher energy import bills and fuel shortages.\n\nWhile todays energy crisis shares some parallels with the oil shocks of the 1970s, there are important differences. Todays crisis involves all fossil fuels, while the 1970s price shocks were largely limited to oil at a time when the global economy was much more dependent on oil, and less dependent on gas. The entire word economy is much more interlinked than it was 50 years ago, magnifying the impact. Thats why we can refer to this as the first truly global energy crisis.\n\nSome gas-intensive manufacturing plants in Europe have curtailed output because they cant afford to keep operating, while in China some have simply had their power supply cut. In emerging and developing economies, where the share of household budgets spent on energy and food is already large, higher energy bills have increased extreme poverty and set back progress towards achieving universal and affordable energy access. Even in advanced economies, rising prices have impacted vulnerable households and caused significant economic, social and political strains.\n\nClimate policies have been blamed in some quarters for contributing to the recent run-up in energy prices, but there is no evidence. In fact, a greater supply of clean energy sources and technologies would have protected consumers and mitigated some of the upward pressure on fuel prices.",

All times EDT.\n\n10:13 p.m.: A planned underwater energy pipeline linking Barcelona in Spain and Marseille in France could take up to seven years to build, Spain's energy minister said Friday, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nFrance, Spain and Portugal announced Thursday they had agreed to build the maritime pipeline instead of a long-discussed pipeline across the Pyrenees but gave no timeline for its construction.\n\nThe underwater pipeline, dubbed BarMar, would initially be used for natural gas but, over time, more and more for hydrogen.\n\nSpain and Portugal had lobbied hard for the construction of a 190-kilometer pipeline across the Pyrenees to France, which would allow the shipment of gas further on into Germany, but France opposed it.\n\n9 p.m.: The World Central Kitchen, which is feeding Ukrainians affected by the war, is also helping to feed the pets of Ukraine, according to WCK CEO.\n\n8:22 p.m.: France's foreign minister said Friday it was vital to keep lines of communication open with Russia, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"We absolutely think it is crucial to keep a channel of communication with those making the decisions in Russia, including President Putin,\" French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said on a visit to Washington.\n\n\"Putin is probably isolated in his very strange vision of the world and the way it could be run. Reinforcing this isolation of his would not be a good option,\" she said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"We need him to hear when we mention our analysis and our assessment of the mistakes he made and what he could do to move on in a different direction,\" she said.\n\n7:47 p.m.: Missile attacks in the cities of Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia caused civilian casualties and damaged civilian infrastructure, including a school in Zaporizhzhia, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Friday during a humanitarian update on Ukraine, reports Margaret Besheer, VOAs United Nations correspondent.\n\nPower outages continue across four northern and central oblasts of Ukraine, as well as in the capital, Kyiv, Dujarric said.\n\nOn Thursday, a convoy of eight trucks delivered shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene materials to Velyka Oleksandrivka, a newly retaken area of southern Khersonska oblast. The supplies were provided by the International Organization for Migration, the U.N. Refugee Agency and the World Health Organization.\n\nAlso on Thursday, with the help of a local non-governmental organization, UNHCR delivered emergency shelter materials to a settlement in Zaporizhka. The delivery followed a missile attack that damaged or destroyed about 200 homes.\n\nUNHCR also provided generators and fan heaters to local authorities in the northern Sumska oblast to enable hospitals and other civilian infrastructure to keep running following missile attacks.\n\n6:57 p.m.: Spanish authorities moved a luxury yacht linked to the sanctioned head of Russian defense group Rostec after the shipyard where it was berthed stopped receiving payments for its repairs, a transport ministry source said, according to Reuters.\n\nThe multi-million-dollar Valerie was transferred to a marina last month, the source and other officials said, highlighting the logistical challenges authorities have faced managing vessels being held across Europe because of sanctions imposed over Russia's military actions in Ukraine.\n\n6:18 p.m.: The White House is in talks with billionaire Elon Musk about setting up SpaceX's satellite internet service Starlink in Iran, CNN reported on Friday, citing officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe satellite-based broadband service could help Iranians circumvent the regime's restrictions on accessing the internet and certain social media platforms.\n\nThe Islamic Republic has been engulfed by protests that erupted after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody last month.\n\nSpaceX and the White House did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\n5:25 p.m.: U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Friday.\n\n4:30 p.m.: The Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric dam in southern Ukraine was captured in the beginning of the invasion because of its strategic importance: it supplies the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula with water, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nLocated on the Dnieper River, the dam is one of the biggest facilities of its kind in Ukraine. And the reservoir behind it can hold 18km3 of water.\n\nBuilt in Soviet times in the 1950s, the Kakhovka dam pumps water into the North Crimean canal, which starts in southern Ukraine and crosses the entire Crimean Peninsula.\n\nThe dam and the hydroelectric power station were captured by Russian troops at the very start of the invasion on February 24.\n\nIf the dam were to burst, hundreds of thousands of people around the lower Dnieper would be in danger of flooding, including the city of Kherson itself.\n\n3:23 p.m.: The Ukrainian president's office said on Friday that 88 towns and villages had been recaptured in the southern Kherson region, where Ukrainian forces have been advancing in recent weeks, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"Kherson region: 88 settlements de-occupied,\" Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president's office, said on social media.\n\nLast week, Kyiv said 75 towns and villages had been liberated in the region.\n\nWhen exactly the settlements were recaptured is unclear.\n\n2:30 p.m: Ukrainian forces bombarded Russian positions in the occupied and illegally annexed southern Kherson region, targeting resupply routes across a major river while inching closer Friday to a full assault on one of the first urban areas Russia captured after invading the country, The Associated Press reported.\n\nRussian-installed officials were reported desperately trying to turn the city of Kherson, a prime objective for both sides because of its key industries and major river and sea port, into a fortress while attempting to evacuate tens of thousands of residents.\n\nThe Kremlin poured as many as 2,000 draftees into the Kherson region one of four provinces Moscow illegally annexed and put under Russian martial law to replenish losses and strengthen front-line units, according to the Ukrainian armys general staff.\n\nThe Dnieper River figures prominently in the regional battle because it serves critical functions crossings for supplies, troops and civilians; drinking water for southern Ukraine and the annexed Crimean Peninsula; and power generation from a hydroelectric station. Much of the area, including the power station and a canal feeding water to Crimea, is under Russian control.\n\n1:40 p.m.: During their counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces had to cross the Oskil River to push the enemy out of key settlements. After their successful operations, a bridgehead was created on the left bank that allowed them to liberate other strategic villages in the area. Some of the Ukrainian soldiers described their tactics in detail for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalists.\n\n1:05 p.m.: Britain, France and Germany on Friday called for a United Nations probe of accusations Russia has used Iranian-origin drones to attack Ukraine, allegedly violating a U.N. Security Council Resolution, Reuters reported.\n\nIn a letter signed by their U.N. envoys and seen by Reuters, the three backed Ukraine's call on Monday for such a probe, arguing the drone use breached U.N. Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2231 endorsing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\"We would welcome an investigation by the UN Secretariat team responsible for monitoring the implementation of UNSCR 2231 and stand ready to support the work of the Secretariat in conducting its technical and impartial investigation,\" the three nations, a group known as the E3, said in the letter.\n\n12:25 p.m.:\n\n11:45 a.m.: The European Union will give Kyiv 1.5 billion euros a month in 2023 to help run Ukraine as it fights back Russia's invading troops, the head of the bloc's executive said on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke after the 27 national EU leaders discussed supporting Ukraine during a second day of their summit in Brussels on Friday, the 240th day of Russia's war on its neighbor.\n\nShe said that the EU has so far given Ukraine 19 billion euros this year but that the summit looked at 2023.\n\n\"It is very important for Ukraine to have a predictable and stable flow of income,\" she said, adding that Kyiv estimated its monthly needs at 3-4 billion euros \"for the basics.\n\n11:30 a.m.: A court in Prague has acquitted a Russian citizen who was accused of taking part in Moscow's illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported Friday.\n\nThe Prague City Court ruled on October 20 that there wasn't enough evidence to prove Aleksandr Franchetti's involvement in organizing a criminal group and the illegal incarceration of 11 pro-Ukrainian residents of Crimea during the annexation of the peninsula.\n\nFranchetti remains in custody because the court's ruling was appealed by prosecutors.\n\nFranchetti was arrested in September last year at Ukraine's request. Kyiv accuses him of being an active participant in the events in Crimea in 2014 by joining paramilitary formations called North Wind and Crimea's Self-Defense. The two groups helped seize power lines and gas pipelines during the annexation.\n\nCzech media reports said earlier that Franchetti was granted permanent residence in the Czech Republic in 2000 and has worked in the country as a fitness trainer.\n\n11:15 a.m.:\n\n11:05 a.m.: Russia has hit at least half of Ukraine's thermal generation capacity and caused billions of dollars of damage in attacks since October 10, but not all stricken power units have stopped working completely, Ukraine's energy minister said on Friday.\n\nHerman Halushchenko told Reuters in an interview that 30-40% of overall national power infrastructure had been hit in attacks that he depicted as intended to destroy Ukraine's energy system -- a goal that he said had not been achieved.\n\n10:40 a.m.: The Defense Department says U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin has spoken on the phone to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu.\n\nFridays call was the first time the two had spoken since May 13. Defense officials have said that for some time the Russians had not responded to U.S. efforts to set up calls.\n\nVOAs national security correspondent Jeff Seldin shared the details on Twitter.\n\nAustin also spoke with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov \"to reiterate the unwavering U.S. commitment to supporting Ukraines ability to counter Russias aggression\" as well as the international communitys support for Ukraines future defense, according to a Defense Department statement.\n\n10:25 a.m.: Sweden has taken \"concrete action\" to address Turkey's concerns over its NATO membership bid, including stepping up counter-terrorism efforts against Kurdish militants, Stockholm told Ankara in a letter dated October 6 and seen by Reuters.\n\nThe two-page letter gives 14 examples of steps taken by Sweden to show it \"is fully committed to the implementation\" of a memorandum it signed with Turkey and Finland in June, which resulted in NATO member Turkey lifting its veto of their applications to the trans-Atlantic security alliance.\n\nSwedish officials delivered the letter, which was not previously reported, to Erdogan's office and the foreign ministry at the weekend, a source familiar with the situation said, requesting anonymity due to sensitivity over it.\n\nThe letter was meant to reassure Turkey of Sweden's efforts amid ongoing bilateral talks and to encourage ultimate approval of the NATO membership bid, the source added. According to the letter, Swedish authorities \"carried out new analyses of PKK's role in threats to Sweden's national security and in organized crime (and) this is likely to lead to concrete results.\"\n\n10:10 a.m.:\n\n9:50 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin has been open for negotiations with Ukraine \"from the very beginning,\" and \"nothing has changed\" in that respect, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday, commenting on remarks made by the Turkish president, The Associated Press reported.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan said earlier that Putin appeared to be \"much softer and more open to negotiations\" than in the past. \"We are not without hope,\" he said of the possibility of negotiations to end the conflict.\n\n\"If you remember, President Putin tried to initiate talks with both NATO and the United States even before the special military operation,\" Peskov said, referring to Russias aggression against Ukraine that started almost eight months ago.\n\nRussian officials have repeatedly said they will not negotiate the return of the four Ukrainian regions Moscow illegally annexed last month. After the land grab, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ruled out any talks with Moscow as long as Putin remains president.\n\n9:35 a.m.:\n\n9:20 a.m.: Russia has been sending in thousands of recently mobilized troops to reinforce the defense of the southern region of Kherson, where Kyiv's forces have been making major advances in their offensive to retake territory occupied by Moscow, the Ukrainian military said, as fresh Russian strikes on civilian targets were reported on Friday, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\n\"Up to 2,000 mobilized Russians arrived in the temporarily captured Kherson region to replenish losses and strengthen units on the contact line,\" the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"At the same time, the occupation authorities issued an order to prepare for the evacuation of the so-called banking institutions and Russian medical workers and teachers,\" the statement said.\n\nUkraine is trying to drive Russian forces in Kherson back east across the Dnieper River that bisects the country. Russian soldiers on the western bank, where the city of Kherson is located, are reportedly close to being cut off from supply lines and reinforcements.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said the Kremlin's forces repelled Ukrainian attempts to advance with tanks on the Kherson villages of Sukhanove, Nova Kamyanka, and Chervoniy Yar.\n\nNeither claim could be independently confirmed.\n\n9:05 a.m.:\n\n8:55 a.m.: European Union leaders struggled to find immediate practical solutions on how to deal with the energy crisis but avoided an open rift between Germany and France on Friday that would have exposed a divided bloc as it confronts Russian President Vladimir Putin over his war in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nAfter daylong talks in Brussels dragged well into the night, the 27 EU leaders papered over divisions between some of the biggest member states and at least agreed to continue working on ways to impose a gas price cap in case of big price increases.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron highlighted his work with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to create a veneer of unity after talks that started early Thursday. He said that together with close technical advisers, \"I will see Chancellor Scholz in Paris next week so that we can move forward, with our teams, on all the issues.\"\n\nScholz said the main issue was curbing \"spikes\" in gas trading that may last only a few hours but still send prices excessively upward. He said measures to counter that should be further examined.\n\n8:40 a.m.:\n\n8:25 a.m.: European Union leaders will discuss reducing their economic dependency on China, aiding Kyiv and punishing Iran for its involvement in the war that Russia is waging on Ukraine, when they meet for a second day of talks in Brussels on Friday, Reuters reported.\n\nThe previous day, the 27 EU leaders locked horns over a joint response to the acute energy crunch that has engulfed the bloc since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nTheir summit talks started on Thursday afternoon and ran into the wee hours on Friday as Germany stuck to its refusal to cap gas prices and the 27 could only agree to disagree, declaring they will keep on examining options to put a ceiling on costs.\n\nAs they turn to foreign policy on Friday, they will have a \"strategic discussion\" on their ties with China after the bloc's executive said earlier this week the EU should see Beijing more as a competitor.\n\n\"We have been a bit too complacent as European countries,\" said Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo. \"Over the past months, we've understood that in a lot of pure economic domains, geopolitics also play an important role.\"\n\n8:10 a.m.:\n\n7:50 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the West to warn Russia not to blow up a huge dam that would flood a swath of southern Ukraine, as his forces prepare to push Moscows troops from Kherson in one of the wars most important battles, Reuters reported.\n\nIn a television address, Zelenskyy said Russian forces had planted explosives inside the huge Nova Kakhovka dam, which holds back an enormous reservoir that dominates much of southern Ukraine, and were planning to blow it up to cover their retreat.\n\n\"Now everyone in the world must act powerfully and quickly to prevent a new Russian terrorist attack. Destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster,\" he said.\n\nRussia accused Kyiv earlier this week of planning to rocket the dam. Sergei Surovikin, the commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, said Ukrainian forces had already used U.S.-supplied HIMARS missiles against it in what Ukrainian officials called a sign Moscow could be planning to blow it up and blame Kyiv.\n\nNeither side produced evidence to back up their allegations.\n\n7:35 a.m.:\n\n7:20 a.m.: Iran advised its citizens on Friday not to travel to Ukraine and urged Iranians already there to leave, semi-official news agencies reported, a day after the United States accused Iran of helping Russia operate drones against Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Iranian foreign ministry advisory did not refer to the U.S. allegation. It gave a telephone number for the Iranian embassy in Kyiv to call for advice.\n\n\"Due to the military escalation in Ukraine, all Iranians are strongly advised to refrain from traveling to Ukraine. Also, Iranians living in Ukraine are advised to leave the country for their own safety,\" the ministry statement said.\n\n7:05 a.m.:\n\n6:50 a.m.: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan was quoted as saying on Friday he will meet with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson to discuss the Nordic country's bid to join NATO, as well as the extradition of people Ankara considers terrorists, Reuters reported.\n\nErdogan also said Kristersson, who was recently appointed prime minister, sided with the fight against terrorism, broadcaster NTV reported.\n\n6:30 a.m.:\n\n6:20 a.m.: The Kremlin on Friday sidestepped a question about whether or not President Vladimir Putin had given an order for Russian forces to withdraw from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, Reuters reported.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred the question to Russia's defence ministry.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters, when asked directly whether Putin had ordered a withdrawal, Peskov said: \"This question concerns the conduct of the special military operation, I recommend you address it to the defence ministry.\"\n\n6:10 a.m.:\n\n5:50 a.m.: The photograph, showing a man in combat fatigues posing on a river ferry alongside Russian military equipment, was posted on Russian social media on October 10. Three days later, a video that appeared on the same account seemed to show the same ferry and equipment, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\n\"And we're moving,\" the man, identified as Makar Teplinskiy, from the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk, says in the video. Later, off-screen, a voice can be heard asking, \"Who are you showing that to?\"\n\nThe ferry appears to be part of an ongoing Russian pullback of soldiers and equipment from the right bank of the Dnieper River, in the southern Kherson region, where Ukrainian forces have been making gradual advances. The video was identified and pinpointed by RFE/RL using geolocation, satellite imagery, and surrounding landmarks.\n\nThe findings, by RFE/RL's Russian Service and Schemes, the investigative unit of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, highlight the mounting pressure on Russian forces, who have been pummeled by Ukrainian troops pushing southward. Experts say the advances are likely to lead up to an effort to take back the city of Kherson itself -- the only regional capital to fall to Russian forces since Moscow launched a large-scale invasion on February 24.\n\n5:40 a.m.:\n\n5:25 a.m.: A luxury yacht belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarch Alexey Mordashov departed Hong Kong waters on Thursday, Reuters reported, heading for the South African port of Cape Town, according to private tracking site MarineTraffic.\n\nThe prominent sight of the 141-meter multideck Nord in the city's Victoria harbour in recent weeks had sparked criticism from the United States' State Department, which questioned the transparency of the financial hub and warned of reputational risks.\n\nMordashov, a billionaire close to President Vladimir Putin, was among several Russians sanctioned by the United States and European Union, but not the United Nations, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine for their links to Putin.\n\nWhile several Russian superyachts have been seized or denied entry in Europe and other jurisdictions, the Nord was left undisturbed in Hong Kong after its arrival on Oct. 5.\n\n5:09 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that Russia is likely continuing to prepare for a false-flag attack on the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Iran, the Institute said, is providing military support to Russian forces in Ukraine despite new international sanctions likely in part because Iranian leaders believe that they need Moscows help to upend the U.S.-led global order.\n\n4:25 a.m.:\n\n4:08 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry mentioned a video claiming to show the arrival of Russian troops in Belarus. The announcement is likely an attempt to demonstrate Russian-Belarussian solidarity and to convince Ukraine to divert forces to guard the northern border, the update said.\n\n3:04 a.m.: Jailed Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny said on Thursday that authorities had opened a new criminal case against him for promoting terrorism and extremism, potentially more than doubling his sentence, Reuters reported.\n\nNavalny, the most prominent domestic critic of President Vladimir Putin, is already serving prison terms totaling 11 1/2 years for fraud, contempt of court and parole violations, all of which he rejects as trumped-up charges intended to silence him.\n\n\"You all thought I had been isolated in prison for two years, but it turns out I was actively committing crimes. Luckily, the Investigative Committee was vigilant and didn't miss a thing,\" he said on Twitter.\n\n2:06 a.m.:\n\n1:06 a.m.: Talks on extending a July deal that resumed Ukraine Black Sea grain and fertilizer exports are not making much progress because Russian concerns are not being taken into proper account, Russia's U.N. ambassador in Geneva said on Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nSenior United Nations officials are negotiating with Russia to extend and expand the July 22 deal that could expire next month if an agreement is not reached.\n\n\"I wouldn't say that much has been achieved as a result of the latest consultations. The dialogue is continuing,\" Gennady Gatilov told reporters.\n\nHe reiterated Moscow's stance that Western sanctions were hamstringing its own exports of grain and fertilizer, even to poor countries that need the supplies.\n\n12:02 a.m.: Ukrainians turned off domestic appliances, wrapped themselves in blankets to keep warm and remained defiant Thursday as they faced the first nationwide electricity outages of the war against Russia.\n\nIn response to requests by the president and government, towns and cities restricted power supplies and limited electricity use so that energy companies could repair power facilities hit by a wave of Russian air strikes.\n\nCities including the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv in the northeast announced curbs on the use of electric-powered public transport such as trolleybuses and reduced the frequency of underground trains as winter looms.\n\nSome information in this report came from Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) When a missile struck a power station less than a mile from his apartment on the outskirts of Kyiv, Oleksander Maystrenko didnt panic, run to a bomb shelter or consider evacuating, even though he lives close to what suddenly has become the Russian militarys main target in the war: anything related to Ukraines vital infrastructure.\n\nHis neighbors also havent budged, despite the fact that Tuesdays attack marked by a loud explosion killed three people, severely damaged two facilities inside the plants compound and temporarily knocked out power to about 50,000 households, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko.\n\n\"We arent afraid because we arent just prepared logistically; we are morally prepared,\" Maystrenko said outside his apartment building, where he and two neighbors sat on a bench and smoked only hours after the attack.\n\nThis is what the latest phase of Russias nearly 8-month-old war in Ukraine looks like. Moscow has openly declared its intention to increasingly strike power stations, waterworks and other key infrastructure. One Ukrainian energy official said Wednesday that 40% of the countrys electric power system had been severely damaged, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian forces have destroyed 30% of Ukraines power stations since Oct. 10.\n\nBut Maystrenko and his neighbors say they are prepared.\n\nIf the Russians knock out the power, there are stocks of flashlights and candles, he said. If theres no gas for stoves, he has a plan to build a rudimentary stove in front of the buildings entrance and use firewood that has been collected to heat it. Water has been bottled and jars of pickled vegetables and canned goods have been safely stored.\n\nEveryone knows to have plenty of blankets and warm clothes for the winter, he added.\n\n\"Its never been a secret that this power plant is a target, but weve been preparing since this war started,\" Maystrenko said. The preparations have created a sense of community as well as a united front among neighbors, who once knew each other only in passing and are face a common enemy, he said.\n\nThe attacks have come at a critical time, with winter approaching. Klitschko said that Thursday marks the start of the heating season for Kyiv, which like most urban centers in Ukraine and even Russia uses a Soviet-era central system controlled by the city that provides heat for apartment buildings and businesses.\n\nThursday marked the start of a nationwide electricity conservation campaign announced by Zelenskyys office, with the public being asked to reduce power usage from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. There could also be rolling blackouts.\n\nAn energy facility and plant in Zelenskyys hometown of Kryvyi Rih were hit overnight, leaving the south-central city of 600,000 without electricity until repairs could be made. Regional Gov. Valentin Reznichenko reported serious destruction, appealing to the local population to conserve energy, noting that \"every illuminated business sign, billboard or washing machine can lead to serious emergency shutdowns.\"\n\nNoting the conservation steps on his Telegram channel, presidential adviser Kyrylo Tymoshenko urged all Ukrainians to \"please take this seriously.\"\n\nOne area where power and water were reported knocked out by shelling was Enerhodar, the southern city is next to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, one of the wars most worrisome flashpoints.\n\nUsing energy supplies as a weapon isnt a new tactic for the Kremlin, particularly when it comes to Ukraine.\n\n\"Energy was always quite a holy cow for the Russians, and they claim that by controlling energy they can control the country,\" said Hanna Shelest, the director of security programs at Foreign Policy Council Ukrainian Prism, based in Kyiv.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who declared martial law in four illegally annexed regions of Ukraine, has used his ability to turn off the gas that passes through the countrys extensive, Soviet-era pipeline as leverage. His tactic has been used not just against the government in Kyiv, but also against energy-dependent nations in Europe, who built pipelines via the Baltic Sea for Russian gas.\n\nUnder its new strategy, the Russian military hopes to destroy enough of Ukraines infrastructure to make life so intolerable that residents will blame their own government, Shelest said.\n\nPutin has called Ukraine a failed state and a historical part of Russia. In trying to make Ukrainians suffer, he hopes they will believe him, she said.\n\n\"What we see now is that it is definitely not working so well,\" Shelest said, adding that Ukrainians are increasingly directing their rage at Putin.\n\nZelenskyys admission that Russia had knocked out nearly a third of Ukraines power stations was noteworthy, said Mason Clark, an analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.\n\n\"If the Russians can keep up that sustained damage, and the Ukrainians cant repair it, that could actually start to have an effect,\" he said.\n\nClark said he didnt believe Russia would be able to affect the Ukrainian populations overwhelming support for their military in taking back the territory seized by Moscow.\n\nRecent attacks by what Kyiv describes as Iranian-supplied drones and missiles against civilian housing and other nonmilitary targets \"seem to be just terror attacks, essentially to try to intimidate the Ukrainian population,\" he said.\n\nRussia has used such scare tactics throughout the war out of \"a misguided belief that they will be able to force the Ukrainians to surrender and force negotiations,\" Clark said.\n\nFrom a military sense, Russias use of the Iranian-supplied drones and Kalibr and Iskander cruise missiles against Ukrainian infrastructure is a \"very poor use of limited-precision munitions,\" Clark said.\n\nThe Russians are struggling with dwindling supplies of these high-end weapons, he said, adding that a more strategic move would be to save them for the battlefield, because Ukraines air defenses have succeeded in intercepting and shooting down many of the drones.\n\n\"Its a waste by the Russians of very expensive and limited systems in an attempt to likely achieve a terror effect that isnt going to sway the Ukrainian government or population,\" Clark said.\n\nRepairing infrastructure often falls to local administrations to handle. The port city of Odesa in southern Ukraine designated crews to help neighboring Mykolaiv, which has been under Russian bombardment for weeks.\n\nIn the Kharkiv region, government official Roman Semenukha said Sunday that while repairs to heating systems were underway around the recently liberated city of Kupiansk, its a slow process that first must restore electricity, gas and water.\n\n\"I want to emphasize that private households will be connected to the gas supply, but the situation with high-rise buildings is a bit more complicated, for various reasons,\" said Andrii Besedin, an adviser to the head of the Kharkiv military administration.\n\nRegional authorities in Kharkiv also are assessing the need for firewood, Besedin said, adding that warming shelters will be set up and authorities would offer to evacuate those who want to leave for the winter.\n\n\"Those who wish to do so (will move) to safe areas, where there are all communications. We will work every day to restore the critical infrastructure of these networks,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nJustin Spike contributed to this report from Kupiansk.\n\n___\n\nFollow APs coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the pipelines are in the Baltic Sea, not the North Sea; and the APs style on spelling Kyiv mayors first name is Vitali.",

A single megawatt provides about the same amount of electricity consumed by 400 to 900 homes in a year, according to the Department of Energy.

                "cc_text": "WASHINGTON, DC Congressman Jamie Raskin today released the following statement.\n\n\"I am glad to learn of the withdrawal of the letter of October 24, 2022, whichbecause of its unfortunate timing and other flawsled to the conflation of growing Republican opposition to support for Ukraine, as exemplified by recent statements of Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, with the polar-opposite position of dozens of Democrats like me who have passionately supported every package of military, strategic and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people and are determined to see the Ukrainian people win victory over Vladimir Putin and expel his imperialist forces from their country.\n\n\"In the eight months since Russia began its atrocity-filled and illegal war of aggression against the people of Ukraine, the Ukrainian people have given Americans not just the chance to defend the values of national sovereignty, democracy and pluralism but also great hope for the worlds future. Had Ukrainians been quickly defeated by Putins army, as so many people expected, had Volodymyr Zelensky fled the country, as so many people expected, then a dangerous tyranny would have destroyed a nascent democracy, and prospects for democratic causes everywhere in the world would have darkened. Large countries would have felt emboldened to attack small countries everywhere.\n\n\"But today there is hope because of the strength of President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people, and the cause of democracy and freedom in Ukraine is the cause of the democratic world. We should unite around this just struggle and stay focused on it.\n\n\"Ukraine has given the world a lesson in anti-imperialism and how to fight a just war of self-defense even amidst enormous civilian suffering. Putin has claimed, as European colonizers did for hundreds of years, that the Ukrainian state and the Ukrainian nation do not exist. This obvious lie has been his rationale for an increasingly genocidal war of destruction, the openly avowed goal of which is the destruction of the Ukrainian people as such. These last weeks and days, Russian propagandists have repeatedly appeared on television to urge the murder of Ukrainian children and violence against the Ukrainian population.\n\n\"It is a bad colonial habit to suppose that ultimately peace depends upon the wishes of the great powers and the great powers alone, and even progressive and liberal people can fall into this colonialist reflex.\n\n\"Ukraines struggle embodies a democratic future. Its civilian and military leadership is young and diverse, representing a post-Soviet generation that has learned to treasure freedom and value democracy. Its president, who is Jewish and thus belongs to a small national minority, was elected with 73% of the population, and now has even higher levels of support, thanks to his extraordinary wartime leadership. Thousands of Ukrainian women are fighting on the front, and a woman serves as deputy minister of defense. Sexual minorities are represented within the Ukrainian armed forces. Ukrainians soldiers routinely speak two languages. Ukraine has displayed a striking degree of toleration and decency during a war.\n\n\"The Ukrainians also inspire democratic forces all over the world with their example of civil society. This war is fought and won on the Ukrainian side with the help of countless civilians, organized informally into small horizontal groups, who fill the gaps in logistics. An emblematic image of this war is of the vans driven to the front by civilians to supply soldiers. Where conscripted Russians destroy Ukrainian homes, neighbors come to help. Another common image of this war is the partially repaired house: in the regions from which Russia has been forced to retreat, Ukrainians do what they can to rebuild their neighbors' homes.\n\n\"Moscow right now is a hub of corrupt tyranny, censorship, authoritarian repression, police violence, propaganda, government lies and disinformation, and planning for war crimes. It is a world center of antifeminist, antigay, anti-trans hatred, as well as the homeland of replacement theory for export. In supporting Ukraine, we are opposing these fascist views, and supporting the urgent principles of democratic pluralism. Ukraine is not perfect, of course, but its society is organized on the radically different principles of democracy and freedom, which is why Russia's oligarchical leaders seek to destroy it forever. I am proud to have been banned from Putins Russia for my pro-Ukrainian legislative activism, and I look forward to visiting Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukrainians provide us with an example of courage in defense of national sovereignty and democracy. They are defending their democratic right to choose their own leaders and live in freedom and peace, and they are doing so at great risk and staggering personal cost.\n\n\"Ukrainians today give the democratic world a chance for a critical and historic victory, and we must rally to their side. It is important to be on the right side of a just war, and it is even more important to be on the right side and win. Just as Ukrainian resistance gives us hope, a Ukrainian victory would give us an opening to a much better future for all humanity. All champions of democracy over autocracywhether they call themselves progressives, conservatives or liberalsshould be doing whatever we can to ensure that Ukraine wins this just war as quickly as possible. Diplomacy by the Biden administration will inevitably follow as sustained diplomacy always marks the conclusion of wareven with tyrants and despots. But first Ukraine must winlet us continue to unite as Americans and focus on that central and historic imperative.\"\n\n###",

China repeatedly threatens to control Taiwan, by force if necessary, and Russia invaded Ukraine in February and continues to attack Ukrainian towns and cities with missiles and even Iranian-made kamikaze drones.\n\nA classified version of the report was released to Congress earlier this year.\n\nAnother senior defense official, also speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity Thursday, said nuclear weapons would continue to be the \"bedrock\" of U.S. military deterrence.\n\nAccording to the official, the new defense strategy reflects that the U.S. is now facing two major nuclear-armed competitors in Russia and China.\n\n\"Other non-nuclear capabilities have the potential to complement but cannot replace nuclear deterrence in some circumstances,\" the official said.\n\nOther major threats\n\nRussia's aggression against Ukraine poses \"an immediate and sharp threat,\" Austin said, causing the United States to increase its military presence in Europe from about 80,000 troops to more than 100,000.\n\nBut unlike China, Austin told reporters, \"Russia can't systemically challenge the United States over the long term.\"\n\nThe senior official added that \"Russia is absolutely deterred from attacking NATO,\" as the United States has made clear that it will defend every inch of NATO territory.\n\nBut the official raised concern that Russia's failures on the Ukrainian battlefield could cause it to rely more on its nuclear forces in the future.\n\nOther threats mentioned in the 2022 National Defense Strategy include North Korea, Iran and global violent extremists.\n\nIran remains a destabilizing presence in the Middle East and the greatest state sponsor of terrorism, all while continuing to develop nuclear capabilities that would enable Tehran to produce a nuclear weapon. However, according to the report, \"Iran does not today possess a nuclear weapon\" and the U.S. \"currently believe[s] it is not pursuing one.\"\n\nNorth Korea also continues to expand its nuclear and missile capabilities to threaten U.S. forces and American allies in the region.\n\nThe 2022 strategy is largely a continuation of the 2018 National Defense Strategy under then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, which made a fundamental shift away from primarily countering extremists to focusing first on a potential war with a near-peer competitor.\n\nLast year the U.S. ended its 20-year war in Afghanistan. The U.S. still has a small number of troops in Somalia, Iraq and Syria but has largely shifted away from major counterterrorism operations.\n\nThe new strategy calls for more advancements in technologies from hypersonic weapons to artificial intelligence. Austin added that the fiscal 2023 budget includes more than $130 billion for research and development, the largest such research budget in the department's history.",

                "cc_text": "The chair of the progressive caucus of the US House of Representatives, Pramila Jayapal, has retracted a letter sent by 30 of the members urging Joe Biden to engage in direct talks with Russia to end the war in Ukraine following a heated debate within the Democratic party about future strategy over the conflict.\n\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon, Jayapal made a dramatic U-turn, scrapping the letter that had been sent to the White House the previous day and implying it had all been a mistake. \"The letter was drafted several months ago, but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting,\" she said.\n\nJayapal went on to regret what she said was conflation of the progressive Democratic call for a diplomatic end to the Ukraine war with a recent statement by the Republican leader in the House, Kevin McCarthy, which threatened an end to aid for the stricken country should the Republican party take back the House in next months midterm elections.\n\nJayapal said: \"The letter sent yesterday has been conflated with GOP opposition to support for the Ukrainians just defense of their national sovereignty. As such, it is a distraction at this time and we withdraw the letter.\"\n\nJayapals retraction is the latest twist in a strange 24 hours of Democratic politics, which has seen the progressive caucus apparently lend its name to a call for direct talks with Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, followed by a fierce backlash and then staged walking back of the position.\n\nIn the original letter, sent to the White House on Monday and first reported by the Washington Post, the progressive Democrats called on Biden to make \"vigorous diplomatic efforts\" towards a \"negotiated settlement and ceasefire\". They highlighted the global hunger and poverty that could ensue from Russias illegal invasion of Ukraine as well as \"elevated gas and food prices at home\", concluding that Americas top priority should be to seek \"a rapid end to the conflict\".\n\nPerhaps the most controversial aspect of the letter was the proposal that Biden should explore \"incentives to end hostilities, including some form of sanctions relief\" for Russia.\n\nThe letter provoked fierce pushback from several Democratic lawmakers including one of its own signatories and elicited a frosty White House response. It was interpreted as the first sign of friction over Ukraine within the Democratic party, which has until now stood firm behind Bidens unconditional backing of Kyiv in its battle to defend and retrieve its sovereign territory from Moscow.\n\nThe timing of the correspondence was also criticised, coming at a crucial stage in the war and just a week after Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, said that Congress was \"not going to write a blank check to Ukraine\".\n\nThe blowback from Democrats was so intense that within hours of the letter being dispatched, Jayapal was forced to issue a \"clarification\".\n\n\"Let me be clear: we are united as Democrats in our unequivocal commitment to supporting Ukraine in their fight for their democracy and freedom in the face of the illegal and outrageous Russian invasion, and nothing in the letter advocates for a change in that support,\" she said.\n\nThe original letter was signed by several of the most prominent leftwing Democrats in the House, including the so-called \"Squad\" of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib. Jamie Raskin, a member of the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, was also among the 30.\n\nThe White House responded by repeating Bidens central approach that Ukraine will decide for itself when and how to negotiate with Russia. The press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, reiterated that there would be \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\".\n\nIndividual Democratic lawmakers were more pointed in their reaction including signatories. Mark Pocan, a congressman from Wisconsin who signed the letter, said it had first been drafted in July and indicated that he had been caught off guard by its publication.\n\n\"I have no idea why it went out now. Bad timing,\" he said.\n\nJoe Biden speaks by phone to Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in the Oval Office in December last year. Photograph: Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nA second signatory, Mark Takano of California, put out a statement after the letter was revealed saying he remained \"steadfast in support of the Ukrainian people\".\n\nRuben Gallego of Arizona, a member of the progressive caucus who declined to sign the letter, posted an acerbic response on Twitter. He wrote: \"The way to end a war? Win it quickly. How is it won quickly? By giving Ukraine the weapons to defeat Russia.\"\n\nThe sharpest comment from any Democrat came from the former marine and representative from Massachusetts, Jake Auchincloss. He condemned the letter as \"an olive branch to a war criminal whos losing his war. Ukraine is on the march. Congress should be standing firmly behind [Bidens] effective strategy, including tighter not weaker! sanctions.\"\n\nAfter the initial eruption of criticism, some of the progressive signatories defended their action. Ro Khanna of California, who pointed out that he had voted for each of the aid packages to Ukraine, said: \"Our nation should never silence or shout down debate.\"\n\nCongress has so far approved about $66bn for Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February, including military, humanitarian and economic help. With Ukraine stepping up its advance on Russian positions as a potentially punishing winter approaching, and with the US midterm elections looming on 8 November, the progressives letter could not have landed at a more sensitive time.\n\nRussia specialists warned that the intervention could embolden Putin and loosen US commitment to lead the international coalition in support of Ukraine. Yoshiko Herrera, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said, \"The biggest problem in the letter is that it may weaken US support for Ukraine by fostering the appearance of divisions among those who support Ukraine.\"\n\nCracks, albeit fine ones, are already clearly visible on the Republican side. The largest aid package for Ukraine, amounting to $40bn, was passed in May with 57 Republicans in the House and 11 in the Senate voting against.\n\nSupporters of the letter said that it reflected a desire to end the war through diplomacy an aspiration which Biden himself has championed. He was explicit about that goal in a speech he made in Delaware in June.\n\nBiden said: \"It appears to me that, at some point along the line, theres going to have to be a negotiated settlement here. And what that entails, I dont know.\"",

It said one vessel had received minor damage.\n\nHours later, a statement by the foreign ministry in Moscow said: \"The Russian side cannot guarantee the safety of civilian dry cargo ships participating in the 'Black Sea Initiative', and suspends its implementation from today for an indefinite period.\"\n\nIt said the move was \"in connection with the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces, which were led by British specialists\" and that these actions \"were directed... against Russian ships that ensured the functioning of the said humanitarian corridor\".\n\nMoscow claimed 16 aerial and maritime drones were destroyed, and that only a minesweeper had sustained damage.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether that is indeed the case, with reports suggesting that the flagship frigate was also hit. Claims and counterclaims have become part of this war.\n\nPresident Zelensky said Russia's decision was not one that had been made today, but in September \"when it blocked the movement of ships with our food produce\".\n\n\"Why is it that some handful of individuals somewhere in the Kremlin can decide whether there will be food on the tables of people in Egypt or in Bangladesh?\" he added.\n\nMr Zelensky said a strong international response was needed from both the UN and the world's twenty largest economies.\n\nThe White House said Russia was \"weaponising food\".\n\nA UN spokesman said the organisation, which brokered the deal with Turkey, was in touch with Moscow.\n\nIt added that it was \"vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative\", which it said was a critical humanitarian effort improving access to food for millions of people around the world.\n\nThe agreement allowed Ukraine to resume its Black Sea grain exports, which had been blocked when Russia invaded the country.\n\nIt was personally negotiated by the UN secretary general and celebrated as a major diplomatic victory that helped ease a global food crisis.\n\nBut Russia has complained that its own exports are still hindered, and had previously suggested it might not renew the deal.\n\nReuters\n\nThe Russian Navy at the entrance to the port city of Sevastopol in 2014\n\nIn recent days, Kyiv has accused Moscow of deliberately delaying the passage of ships, creating a queue of more than 170 vessels.\n\nSaturday's drone attack comes as Ukrainian troops successfully retake territory occupied by Russian troops since they launched their invasion on 24 February.\n\nRussia has responded by launching large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly on the country's energy grid.\n\nCrimea was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and is extremely symbolic for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn recent weeks, several attacks have hit the peninsula, where the Russian army has built up a large presence.\n\nSevastopol is the largest city in the region and home to Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-installed governor of the city, said Russia's navy had repelled the latest attack - the \"most massive\" on the city since February.\n\nHe said that all unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) had been shot down and no civilian infrastructure had been damaged.\n\nThe Ukrainian government rarely comments on claims made by Russian authorities in Crimea, although senior officials often celebrate incidents on the peninsula.\n\nUkraine has vowed to recapture all territory that is under Russian occupation, including Crimea, which has been a key base for President Putin's forces during the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWithout providing any evidence, the Russian defence ministry also accused British navy specialists of helping Ukrainian forces prepare the attack on Saturday morning.\n\nIt also said the same unit was \"involved in plotting, organising, and implementation of the terrorist attack in the Baltic Sea on 26 September this year to blow up the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines\".\n\nIn its reply, the MoD said: \"To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.\n\n\"This invented story, says more about arguments going on inside the Russian government than it does about the west.\"\n\nFrance also said it did not believe the Russian allegations.\n\nIn recent days, Russia has been engaged in what US and Ukrainian officials describe as a disinformation campaign, with unsubstantiated claims that Kyiv is preparing to use a radioactive dirty bomb, or even biological mosquitoes.\n\nRussia's Black Sea Fleet was previously targeted in April this year by Ukrainian forces when its flagship warship, the Moskva, was sunk. The 510-crew missile cruiser had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, and its sinking was a major symbolic and military blow.\n\nEarlier this month, a blast occurred on the Crimean bridge - a pivotal symbol of Russia's annexation of Crimea.",

It controls both the only land route to the Crimea peninsula Russia seized in 2014, and the mouth of the Dnipro, the 2,200-kilometre-long (1,367-mile) river that bisects Ukraine.\n\nStaff at Kherson's Russian-backed administration were also being relocated to the eastern side of the Dnipro, Saldo said, although he said Russia had the resources to hold the city and even counter-attack if necessary. Russian forces near Kherson have been driven back by 20-30 km (13-20 miles) in the last few weeks.\n\nEight months after being invaded, Ukraine is pressing major counter-offensives in the east and south to try to take as much territory as it can before winter.\n\nELECTRICITY CUTS\n\nRussia has intensified its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's power and water infrastructure this week in what Ukraine and the West call a campaign to intimidate civilians ahead of the cold winter.\n\nOn Thursday, electricity supply will be restricted nationwide between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., government officials and the grid operator Ukrenergo said. Street lighting in cities will be limited, a presidential aide said on the Telegram messaging app, adding that if electricity use was not minimised, there would be temporary blackouts.\n\nWhile limited to Thursday, \"we do not exclude that with the onset of a cold weather we will be asking for your help even more frequently,\" Ukrenergo said.\n\nRussia has destroyed three Ukrainian energy facilities over the last 24 hours, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Wednesday night video address.\n\nA Russian missile strike hit a major thermal power station in the city of Burshtyn in western Ukraine on Wednesday, the region's governor said.\n\nZelenskiy, who has said a third of his country's power stations have been hit by Russian strikes, discussed security at power supply plants with senior officials.\n\n\"We are working to create mobile power points for the critical infrastructure of cities, towns and villages,\" Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.\n\n\"We are preparing for various scenarios,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n[1/5]A view shows the city administration building hit by recent shelling in the course of Ukraine-Russia conflict, in Donetsk, Russian-controlled Ukraine, October 16, 2022. REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nPUTIN'S POWERS\n\nIn televised remarks to his Security Council, Putin boosted the powers of Russia's regional governors and ordered the creation of a coordinating council under Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to support his \"special military operation\".\n\nHe said the \"entire system of state administration\" must be geared to back up the Ukraine effort.\n\nIt was unclear what the immediate impact of Putin's declaration of martial law would be, beyond much tighter security measures in Kherson and the other three regions.\n\nBut Ukraine, which along with the West does not recognise Moscow's self-styled annexations, derided the move. Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called it \"a pseudo-legalisation of (the) looting of Ukrainians' property.\"\n\n\"This does not change anything for Ukraine: we continue the liberation and deoccupation of our territories,\" he tweeted.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said Putin had found himself in a difficult position and his only tool was to brutalize Ukrainian civilians. The U.S. State Department said it was no surprise that Russia was resorting to \"desperate tactics\".\n\nUkrainian and Russian forces exchanged intermittent artillery fire on a section of the Kherson front in the Mykolaiv region on Wednesday, the impacts marked by towers of smoke.\n\nSeveral Ukrainian soldiers said they were aware of the martial law declaration but were not worried, although they warned a visiting Reuters reporter of the danger presented by Russian drones.\n\n\"For sure he's (Putin) up to no good. We understand that,\" said Yaroslav, who declined to give his last name. \"But whatever they are doing, we will screw them anyway.\"\n\nOleh, who also withheld his last name, said Russia in the past had warned about what it claimed would be escalatory Ukrainian actions only to carry them out itself.\n\n\"We are just concerned about our people in the Kherson region,\" he said.\n\nMoscow denies deliberately targeting civilians, though the conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions and pulverised Ukrainian cities.\n\nThe Kremlin placed a nuclear umbrella over the regions it says it has annexed, among nuclear threats which Britain's chief of defence staff Tony Radakin said signalled desperation.\n\n\"It is a sign of weakness, which is precisely why the international community needs to remain strong and united,\" Radakin said during a speech.\n\nBritish Defence Minister Ben Wallace met his U.S counterpart in Washington this week to discuss shared security concerns about the situation in Ukraine, a senior defence source said in response to speculation around the sudden trip.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Balmforth, Max Hunder and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Andrew Osborn, Philippa Fletcher and Grant McCool; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne, John Stonestreet and Rosalba O'Brien\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraines foreign minister, said he extended a formal invitation to U.N. nuclear inspectors to independently establish that Ukraine has \"nothing to hide.\"\n\nThe Washington Post could not verify either sides claim. The Institute for the Study of War said that \"the Kremlin is unlikely to be preparing an imminent false-flag dirty bomb attack.\" Instead, the think tank noted, \"Shoigu likely sought to slow or suspend Western military aid to Ukraine and possibly weaken the NATO alliance\" with his allegations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe incident has thrown Western and Ukrainian fears of a Russian nuclear attack into sharp relief, as the conflict hits the eight-month mark Monday, and frustrations grow within Russia that what officials initially conceived as a quick victory is turning into a protracted and costly conflict.\n\nFor many, it has also raised the question: What is a dirty bomb?\n\nDirty bombs are made of conventional explosives and radioactive material, designed to spread the material once they explode. They are not nuclear weapons and bear no resemblance to the atomic bombs used by the United States in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Dirty bombs are far less powerful: Their \"radiation could be dispersed within a few blocks or miles of the explosion,\" according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.\n\nAs the department notes, the explosive substance in a dirty bomb is more likely to cause harm to humans than the radioactive material it carries. The goal of using a dirty bomb may not be maximal destruction, but rather an attempt to \"create fear and panic, contaminate property, and require potentially costly cleanup,\" it explains.\n\nShoigus claims that Ukraine would use a dirty bomb are particularly sensitive because Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for a guarantee from Russia that it would not attack Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussias claims also come as analysts say the war in Ukraine has entered a new chapter one that has seen Russia face several military losses, including Ukrainian gains in the south and the explosion that damaged the Crimean Bridge, which links Crimea to mainland Russia.\n\nMoscow has retaliated forcefully, with massive strikes against Ukraines capital and its energy infrastructure ahead of winter. But Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing increasingly vocal criticism at home, as a growing number of war propagandists bemoan a perceived lack of progress and thousands of Russian men flee their country to avoid being forced to fight in Ukraine.\n\nSetbacks in its invasion of Ukraine have led to increased nuclear threats by Russia, echoing Cold War events like the little-known 1983 nuclear crisis. (Video: Joshua Carroll/The Washington Post)\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Putin has threatened to use \"all means available\" to defend Russian-occupied territory. \"I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all means at our disposal,\" Putin said Sept. 21. \"This is not a bluff.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after that, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russias Security Council, wrote on Telegram that \"Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons if necessary.\" But he said Russia would do so only \"in predetermined cases\" laid out in its nuclear-policy documents.\n\nCIA Director William J. Burns told CBS News last month that it was difficult to assess how serious Putin is about the potential use of nuclear weapons. He said the U.S. intelligence community has not seen \"any practical evidence\" that there is an \"imminent threat.\" Still, he said the United States should take the comments \"very seriously.\"\n\nU.S. officials previously told The Washington Post that the United States for several months has been privately warning Russias leadership of the grave consequences that would follow the use of a nuclear weapon. Recent, more specific statements from Moscow appear to have set off alarm bells in Western countries and in Ukraine.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWhen asked about Putins nuclear threats, Col. Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of Ukraines ground forces, told ABC News in an interview released Monday, \"We are and should be worried.\"",

                "cc_text": "The Russia-Ukraine war created a great deal of geopolitical turbulence and a host of problems in the global economy. Since the war began, prices for energy and agricultural products have started to rise. Instability in the global economy has different effects on different regions. One of the most important regions affected by the Russia-Ukraine war is Central Asia.\n\nGenerally, the attitudes of Central Asian people toward the Russia-Ukraine war are mainly negative. For example, one question in the Central Asian Barometer (CAB) Survey Wave 11, which was conducted in May-June of 2022, asked: \"Do you think the situation in Ukraine will have a positive impact on our country, a negative impact, or no impact at all?\"\n\nAmong respondents from Kyrgyzstan, 36 percent and 34 percent answered that war will have a somewhat negative or very negative impact on their country, respectively. In addition, 35 percent and 20 percent of responders from Kazakhstan also answered that the war will have a somewhat negative or very negative impact on Kazakhstan.\n\nPeople are mainly concerned about that how war will affect their daily life and purchasing power. High prices in Central Asia have already impacted the public opinion of Central Asian countries. According to the CAB Survey Wave 11 question, \"Would you say that you were very concerned, somewhat concerned, somewhat unconcerned, or very unconcerned with high prices in our country?\" 32.4 percent and 29.3 percent of the respondents from Uzbekistan said they were very concerned or somewhat concerned about the high prices, respectively. Similarly, 68.7 percent and 25.2 percent of respondents from Kazakhstan say they are very or somewhat concerned about high prices.\n\nA main concern for the people of Central Asia is related to increasing prices of basic necessitates, such as food, clothing, gas, and so on. According to the CAB Survey Wave 11, 18.6 percent and 24.8 percent of respondents from Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan think that one of the negative consequences of war will be an increase in the prices of basic necessitates.\n\nPeople's opinions about rising prices reflect reality. Since the start of the war, the cost of living in the region has risen due to inflation. According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the regional inflation rate remains up at 16 percent.\n\nEnergy and food constitute a large part of household consumption. Prices of agricultural products rose after the Kremlin imposed a ban on grain exports to members of the Eurasian Economic Union. In addition to food prices, high gas prices negatively affect households and increase living costs. Gas plays an important role in the energy mix of Central Asian countries, especially Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, where high prices directly affect people's well-being and purchasing power.\n\nThe recent dramatic influx of Russians into Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, in particular, generates mixed effects for locals. On the one hand, Russians generally have significantly higher incomes than local people, and they can contribute to economic growth; on the other hand, they may cause further inflation and lead to additional increases in the price of food, real estate, and rent that have a negative affect on locals.\n\nRemittances are a particular concern. Seasonal migration to Russia provides a major lifeline to the households of Central Asian people because of the more competitive incomes in Russia. In this context, Russia is the first choice of Central Asian people for seasonal migration. According to the CAB Survey Wave 11, 40 percent and 56.6 percent of respondents from Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan find Russia the most attractive country for labor migration. Out of all the Central Asia republics, remittances contribute to the economy in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan most significantly, amounting to 31.3 percent of GDP in Kyrgyzstan and 26.7 percent in Tajikistan in 2020.\n\nAccording to the latest EBRD report, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan continue to receive remittances from Russia. The volume of remittances made to Uzbekistan in January-June 2022 reached $6.5 billion, two times more than the same period last year.\n\nHowever, despite the increasing foreign exchange flow to Central Asian countries, the large-scale war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia lead to uncertainties and complicate forecasts, which may cause unexpected risks for the Central Asian economies in the future. After sanctions, the deterioration of the business environment resulted in instability for labor migrants and caused an unbalanced flow of remittances. With the ongoing war, the reality resonates with peoples fear. The World Bank released an estimate that the flow of remittances is expected to decline by 33 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 21 percent in Uzbekistan, and 22 percent in Tajikistan.\n\nFinally, according to the CAB Survey Wave 11, growing uncertainty in international business has different impacts in Central Asian countries. The increasing price of oil and gas in the international energy market generated increasing revenue for Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan and the re-export of Chinese goods to Russia has been a boon for small and medium Kyrgyz businesses. However, despite these positive effects, there is also a range of negative effects. Due to Russias large-scale war in Ukraine, most Russian projects are expected to remain suspended or be canceled, which will have an impact on employment rates. In addition, rising production costs challenge local businesses. Since February, companies from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan have been facing growing production costs or import problems from Russia or Ukraine. As a result, this situation affects their competitiveness, increasing uncertainty, and leading to closures, and further job losses.\n\nTo sum up, despite a few positive surprises, the wars negative impacts on regional economies outweigh any incidental benefits. The consequences of war and economic problems mainly overlap with Central Asian people's economic concerns. In the short term, rising energy commodity prices may be a cushion for some Central Asian countries to decrease the negative effects of the war. However, in the medium term, growing uncertainty in the global economy and new sanction waves on Russia foresee challenges for Central Asian economies and unexpected external shocks.",

We will gradually come to this - with the help of our partners, I'm confident of this,\" the Ukrainian leader said in a video.\n\nAlmost a third of Ukraine's power stations and other energy-generating facilities have reportedly been destroyed in a wave of air strikes since Monday last week.\n\nThe areas targeted by the latest attacks include the Cherkasy region, south-east of the capital Kyiv, and the city of Khmelnytskyi, further west.\n\nAir strikes and power disruptions were also reported from Odesa in the south to Rivne and Lutsk in the north-west.\n\nThe national electricity operator, Ukrenergo, said the strikes may have caused more damage than intense bombardment earlier this month.\n\nMr Zelensky said that 36 rockets had been launched on Saturday, and most of them had been downed.\n\nReuters\n\nThe latest wave of strikes have also wrecked many homes\n\nThe deputy mayor of the western city of Lviv, Serhiy Kiral, told the BBC on Saturday that Russia's strategy was to damage critical infrastructure before the winter, and bring the war to areas beyond the front line.\n\n\"The more successes the Ukrainian armed forces are having at the front the worse it's going to be for people on the home front because Russia is going to do all it can to target civilians and to target critical infrastructure,\" he said in an interview with the Newshour radio programme.\n\nOn Friday Mr Zelensky accused Russia of planting mines at a hydroelectric dam in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, which is under the control of Moscow's forces.\n\nHe said that if the Kakhovka hydropower plant was destroyed, hundreds of thousands of people would be in danger of flooding. Russia has denied planning to blow up the dam and said Ukraine was firing missiles at it.\n\nThe dam may provide Russia with one of the few remaining routes across the River Dnieper (called Dnipro by Ukrainians) in the partially occupied Kherson region.\n\nThousands of civilians have been leaving the city of Kherson in recent days, as Ukrainian forces advance.\n\nAnd on Saturday a new directive from occupying Russian authorities was released, renewing its appeal for civilians to leave \"immediately\".\n\nThe transfer or deportation of civilians by an occupying power from occupied territory is considered a war crime. In September, the UN said there were already credible accusations of forced deportation of Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied areas.\n\nRussia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzia, said the allegations were unfounded.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's armed forces said that Russian troops on Saturday had left two villages - Charivne and Chkalove - in Kherson region. The claim has not been independently verified.",

                "cc_text": "Thats why, again, we see him doubling down. Hes got himself in a corner in the war and in a corner domestically at home. He has made himself the face of this war in Ukraine. His September 30th speech basically said its his war, his annexation, his Russia. And so, everything will fall on him if it falls apart.\n\nReynolds: In the autocratic system that Putin has built, he has to stand for election every so often even though its mostly window dressing. But it periodically renews his legitimacy. One of those years is 2024. Is he facing a deadline? Does he need to look like hes won this war by 2024?\n\nHill: One would think so. In 2024, the reelection has to be in the early part of the year. So, weve got a year and a few months in the Russian political calculations to start to prepare for this and ensure that it all goes smoothly. That was why Putin wanted to get the quick victory in Ukraine well out of the way. Ukraine started in February and March of 2022, because February and March of 2024 will be election time.\n\nIm sure Putin thought he would have been unassailable with a quick, victorious war. Ukraine would be back in the fold and then probably after that, Belarus. Moldova as well, perhaps. There would have been a reframing of the next phase of Putin as the great czar of a reconstituted \"Russkiy mir\" or \"Russian world.\"\n\nIf Putin had succeeded at that, maybe he could have found himself in a position where he could have begun to delegate some power to others.\n\nJust this past week, on October 7th, Putin turned 70. Hes in that age when people are asking, does he die in office? There are lots of questions about succession. 2024 is very much an inflection point for the system.\n\nReynolds: Do you feel like Ukraine is on course for a military victory and what would that mean to the Russian side?\n\nHill: Ukraine has already had a great moral, political and military victory. Russia has not achieved the aims of its special military operation. But I think Putin is obviously hoping that now, with all of the nuclear saber-rattling, threats of nuclear Armageddon, deploying Elon Musk and others to convey his messages, that basically he can take the territory that hes got and get recognition of that. And then he hopes that he will be able to put pressure back on Ukraine. Hed still like to see the Ukrainian political system crumble away. Hed like to get somebody as leader of Ukraine who is personally loyal to him. Putin hopes that hell still prevail, that hell find other ways of getting what he wanted when he went across the border in February.\n\nReynolds: So to some extent, the biggest thing that Putin wants right now is to get Zelenskyy out. He wants somebody more pliant.\n\nHill: Thats exactly what he wants. And Im sure he feels that he might still get that. I mean, everything that hes doing is an effort to discredit Ukraine and Ukrainians and Zelenskyy.\n\nUkraine has the right to choose their own leadership. But Putin will try to manipulate this whichever way he can. Hell keep trying to soften the battlefield beyond Ukraine, keep on trying to poison attitudes internationally against Ukraine.\n\nReynolds: Along those lines, what do you make of the fact that some Americans, primarily in the Trump wing of the Republican Party and some Fox News personalities, are expressing doubts about how much support the United States should direct to Ukraine? Is there something about this conflict that you dont think they understand?\n\nHill: This goes back to the point I tried to make when I testified at the first impeachment trial against President Trump. Theres a direct line between that episode and now. Putin has managed to seed hostile sentiment toward Ukraine. Even if people think they are criticizing Ukraine for their own domestic political purposes, because they want to claim that the Biden administration is giving too much support for Ukraine instead of giving more support to Americans, etc. theyre replaying the targeted messaging that Vladimir Putin has very carefully fed into our political arena. People may think that theyre acting independently, but they are echoing the Kremlins propaganda.\n\nReynolds: What do you think is the right response from the West if Putin does detonate some sort of nuclear weapon, either as a demonstration or something else?\n\nHill: What Putin is trying to do is to get us to talk about the threat of nuclear war instead of what he is doing in Ukraine. He wants the U.S. and Europe to contemplate, as he says, the risks that we faced during the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Euromissile crisis. He wants us to face the prospect of a great superpower war. His solution is to have secret diplomacy, as we did during Cuban Missile Crisis, and have a direct compromise between the United States and Russia.\n\nBut theres no strategic standoff here. This is pure nuclear blackmail. There cant be a compromise based on him not setting off a nuclear weapon if we hand over Ukraine. Putin is behaving like a rogue state because, well, he is a rogue state at this point. And hes being explicit about what he wants. We have to pull all the diplomatic stops out. We have to ensure that hes not going to have the effect that he wants with this nuclear brinkmanship.\n\nPutin is also making it very clear that to get what you want in the world, you have to have a nuclear weapon and to protect yourself, you also have to have a nuclear weapon. So this is an absolute mess. Global nuclear stability is on a knife edge.\n\nBut again, this is not about strategic issues. This is not an issue of strategic stability. This is Vladimir Putin pissed off because he hasnt got what he wanted in a war that he started. Its another attempt to adapt to the battlefield.\n\nReynolds: Can this war end in a way that would be satisfying for the West and with Putin remaining as Russian leader? Or is this the beginning of a revolution thats going to be very messy and dangerous?\n\nHill: Its unlikely this ends in any satisfying way. You need every side willing to compromise, and Putin doesnt want to compromise his goals.\n\nAny compromise is, in any case, always at Ukraines expense because Putin has taken Ukrainian territory. If we think about World War I, World War II or the settlements in many other conflicts, they always involved some kind territorial disposition that left one side very unhappy.\n\nThere is not going to be a happy or satisfying ending for anybody, and its also not going to be happy or satisfying for Vladimir Putin either, honestly.\n\nReynolds: It is striking to me that of all the conflicts that Russia has been engaged in since Putin became president, that none of them have been resolved with any kind of a peace settlement. They just have been fought to stalemate.\n\nHill: Theres not any good outcome I can see come out of this. Whats incumbent upon us is to figure out is how to constrain Russias ability to put Ukraine under pressure again in the future or invade again. If theres any interim freezing of battle lines, make sure that theyre not recognized as official. Maybe we can contemplate some international receivership. Weve had many of these different formulations in the past for disputed territory. We have to ensure, again, that Ukraine can always defend itself and make it impossible for Putin to break out of constraints and do this again.\n\nBut that still leaves you with lots of questions about the future relationship with Russia, the future configuration of any European security institutions. How do we reconfigure ourselves internationally to deal with this? The United Nations has proven to be in dire need of an overhaul. The United Nations has been a major player in this conflict. The secretary-general has been heavily involved investigating war crimes and pressing resolutions. But the United Nations has shown itself inadequate because of the configuration of the Security Council and the veto. Everybodys talking about how to address this.\n\nReynolds: It occurs to me that theres a kind of reckoning coming for NATO. With Finland joining, that adds a long direct border between NATO and Russia. With the new union between Belarus and Russia, theres going to be another NATO border between Poland and Belarus. Considering the fact that NATOs already getting a line across Europe that its going to have to defend, should NATO consider membership for Ukraine?\n\nHill: This is also going to be a big issue, right? There are so many people out there who still look at Ukraine as a proxy war. Many of the people trying to push Ukraine to surrender are basically those who believe that the United States or NATO is somehow using Ukraine in a proxy war with Russia.\n\nWere not in a proxy war with Russia, just like we werent in a proxy war with Germany during World War I when we were trying to get German forces out of France and Belgium. It wasnt a proxy war either when we were trying to get Germany out of Poland and all the other places that it invaded in Europe during World War II. We are trying to help Ukraine liberate itself, having been invaded by Russia.\n\nThis whole proxy war debate deprives Ukraine of agency. But, if we talk about Ukraine being part of NATO at this particular moment, it will simply feed into this flawed discussion. It will detract from the essence of what this war is, which is Russia trying to seize Ukrainian territory.\n\nRussia believes NATO is simply a cover for the United States in Europe. I think it should be very clear right now with Finland and Sweden wanting to join that this is not the case at all. Finland and Sweden did not apply to NATO before, they have now because NATO is focused on ensuring common collective security and defense, and Russia has put all of Europe at risk.\n\nI see current NATO expansion as a kind of an interim step, a way station to thinking more broadly about how we configure ourselves after Ukraine.\n\nYou know, theres also talk about making Ukraine a \"giant Israel,\" making Ukraine completely self-sufficient for its own security, as, frankly, Finland was before. I think we have to have an open discussion about all of this and not be fixated on one aspect or another.\n\nReynolds: In other words, even if Ukraine wins the war for its territory, even if Putin is somehow constrained or deposed, were still at the very beginning of a rethinking of the international order that those outcomes are not going to solve.\n\nHill: Yes. Weve also had the impacts of Covid. Weve got a climate crisis, which should be evident to everybody by now. There are so many things that we need to contend with, and weve only got the skeleton of an international system.\n\nPutin is holding the whole world hostage. Weve got so many things that we have to deal with. I understand why the Global South is so frustrated with all of this: \"While youre fighting this war in Ukraine over the same kind of territorial disputes you guys have been having for a hundred years now, were dying here from disease and climate change. Our countries have flooded. Were starving and you guys are expecting us to help you solve this?\" The United Nations system is breaking down, as [Antnio] Guterres, the secretary-general, has said over and over again. All the alarm bells are going off. And Vladimir Putin is behaving as if its the 1780s all over again.\n\nReynolds: So we need a new or a revamped global order to address the whole problem?\n\nHill: Thats obvious. So how do we do it? A lot of people dont find the idea of a revamped United Nations very popular. I can just imagine some of my former colleagues groaning loudly. We definitely need a slimmed-down version.\n\nBut we do need international institutions to deal with the magnitude of the problems that were facing. Its ironic that Elon Musk, the man who has been talking about getting us to Mars should be Putins messenger for the war in Ukraine, when were having a really hard time getting our act together on this planet. But its glaringly obvious to ordinary people that we need to do so. Time is not on our side.",

All times EDT.\n\n10:30 p.m.: Olha Shevchenko was seven months pregnant when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24. After her home in the village of Prudyanka was shelled that same morning, she fled to nearby Kharkiv and took refuge in a shelter beneath the factory where her husband works. Two months later, her baby boy, Zhenya, was born and he's been in the shelter his whole life. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n10 p.m.: A lawmaker from Vladivostok who fled Russia after it invaded Ukraine has received asylum in the United States, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nViktor Kamenshchikov, who represented the Communist Party in the citys legislature, said in a social media post on October 22 that his request for political asylum has been approved and he has been released from detention.\n\n\"I am free, I have received asylum, and now I can be a full member of American society. Was it a long process? Yes, but I don't regret it at all,\" he said in a Telegram post.\n\nKamenshchikov was detained by U.S. border officials in May as he tried to cross into the country from Mexico. Thousands of Russians have made the same trek since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24.\n\n8:46 p.m.:\n\n8:08 p.m.: In Northern Ukraine, Chernihiv braces for a winter amid attacks on the energy grid by Russia, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. \"We have bought three carloads of various kinds of firewood,\" said Iryna, an employee of the central heating plant in the city of Chernihiv, some 150 kilometers north of Kyiv and 40 kilometers south of the border with Belarus. \"We got the cheapest they had at the sawmill. Good firewood costs at least 6,000 hryvnyas ($165) per carload.\"\n\n\"This is pine,\" she said, showing a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporter around the modest pile that she hopes will get her family through the coming, cold winter. \"It burns quickly and gives little heat. We also bought a load of scrap lumber for 4,500 hryvnyas ($123). We will stay warm somehow.\"\n\nIryna who, like other locals interviewed for the story asked that their last names and images be withheld because of the ongoing Russian invasion lives in a house of some 100 square meters in the settlement of Zhavynka, on the southern edge of the Chernihiv. Because of her job, she has seen the damage inflicted on the citys heating and electricity infrastructure by recent Russian air attacks targeting civilians.\n\n\"I hope it will survive the winter,\" she said.\n\n7:18 p.m.:\n\n6:46 p.m.: French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday said the Russian Orthodox Church was allowing itself to be manipulated by the country's authorities to justify their war in Ukraine and urged it to resist such pressure, Reuters reported.\n\nMacron, who is on an official visit to Italy, spoke in a keynote speech at an international conference organized by Italy's Sant' Egidio Community, a worldwide peace and charity group.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church's number two, Metropolitan Anthony, sat in the front row of the conference hall with other religious leaders as Macron spoke.\n\nThe French president dedicated much of his speech at the conference, whose title is \"The Cry for Peace,\" to Ukraine.\n\n6:03 p.m.:\n\n5:15 p.m.: Iran announced Sunday a contract with Russia to supply it with 40 turbines to help its gas industry amid Western sanctions over Moscow's war in Ukraine, local media reported, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nIran's \"industrial successes are not limited to the fields of missiles and drones,\" Iranian Gas Engineering and Development Company's CEO, Reza Noushadi, was quoted as saying by Shana, the oil ministry's news agency.\n\n\"Currently, 85% of the facilities and equipment needed by the gas industry are built inside the country, and based on this capability, a contract has recently been signed to export 40 Iranian-made turbines to Russia,\" he added.\n\nNoushadi did not specify when the contract was signed, and when the turbines are due to be delivered.\n\nFollowing the imposition of economic sanctions over the Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine, Russia reduced or halted supplies to different European nations, causing energy prices to soar.\n\n4:28 p.m.:\n\n3:55 p.m.: In his nightly video address, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the electricity supply has been restored in all regions that were targeted by Russian terrorist attack yesterday. Responding to claims by Russian Minster of Defense Sergei Shoigu that Ukraine could use a \"dirty\" nuclear bomb, he added \"Wherever Russia has brought death and degradation, we are restoring normal life\" and added \"wherever Russia comes, it leaves behind mass graves, torture chambers, destroyed cities and villages, mined land, destroyed infrastructure and natural disasters.\n\n3:50 p.m.: U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in a phone call on Sunday that he \"rejected any pretext for Russian escalation\" in Ukraine, the Pentagon said.\n\nReuters reports Shoigu told his French, Turkish and British counterparts of Moscow's concern that Ukraine could detonate a \"dirty bomb,\" according to the Russian Defense Ministry.\n\n2:35 p.m.: Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said he has little hope of a diplomatic solution to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine \"until we see the clear defeat of Russia,\" RFE/RL reports. \"We have seen that negotiations and peace agreements with Russia simply do not work,\" Rinkevics said. \"Russia has no need for them. If Russia feels it is losing Ukraine and that the regime of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is losing the confidence of global public opinion and of Russian public opinion, then I think they will sit down at the negotiating table.\"\n\nThe international community should support negotiations if Moscow and Kyiv agree to pursue them, Rinkevics said in an exclusive interview.\n\n\"But at the same time, if an agreement is signed that is a half measure and does not include some sort of strict control over its implementation, then I no longer have any illusions the Russian Federation would abide by it,\" he added.\n\n2:30 p.m.: Norwegian oil and gas workers have noticed unidentified drones buzzing in the North Sea skies overhead, The Associated Press reports. With Norway replacing Russia as Europes main source of natural gas, military experts suspect the unmanned aircraft are Moscows doings. They list espionage, sabotage and intimidation as possible motives for drone flights. The Norwegian government has sent warships, coastguard vessels and fighter jets to patrol around the offshore facilities. The prime minister has invited the navies of NATO allies Britain, France and Germany to help address what could be more than a Norwegian problem.\n\n2 p.m.: German finance minister Christian Lindner said on Sunday it was not yet clear whether a gas price brake for consumers and small businesses planned from March could be implemented, \"pointing to technical and legal difficulties in accelerating the move.\n\nSome state ministers have called for the price brake to come into force in January, as will be the case for larger industrial firms in order to support smaller businesses and households through the winter, Reuters reports.\n\n\"We don't know at the moment whether it is technically possible,\" Lindner said, speaking on the \"Bericht Aus Berlin\" TV program on broadcaster ARD. \"These are technical and legal questions we need to look at... we are working as quickly as possible.\"\n\nUnder current plans, the government will make a one-off payment to cover the December gas bill for households and small and medium-sized businesses this year, with an ongoing mechanism to limit prices in place from March.\n\nMeanwhile, big industrial firms consuming more than 1.5 million kilowatt hours per year will see a brake on prices for 70% of their annual gas consumption from January, with the remaining 30% subject to market prices.\n\n1:30 p.m.: French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday he believed there was a chance for peace in Ukraine, even as Russia warned the conflict there could escalate, Reuters reports.\n\n\"There is the prospect for peace, it will come around at some moment,\" said Macron at a conference in Rome aimed at seeking ways to promote world peace.\n\n\"And at a particular moment, given how things are evolving, and when the Ukrainian people and its leaders will have decided on the terms of this, a peace deal can be built up with the other side,\" added Macron.\n\nFrance has repeatedly stressed the importance of keeping Western diplomatic channels to Moscow open since Russian forces invaded Ukraine on February 24.\n\n1 p.m.: In a tweet, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba characterized the Russian state-controlled RT media outlet an inciter of genocide on Sunday after a presenter said Ukrainian children who saw Russians as occupiers under the Soviet Union should have been drowned.\n\nIn a show broadcast last week, RT presenter Anton Krasovsky said children who criticized Russia should have been \"thrown straight into a river with a strong current,\" Reuters reports.\n\nHe was responding to an account by Russian science fiction author Sergei Lukyanenko about how, when he first visited Ukraine in the 1980s, children told him they would live better lives were it not for Moscow occupying their country.\n\n\"They should have drowned in the Tysyna (river),\" Krasovsky said in response. \"Just drown those children, drown them.\" Alternatively, he said, they could be shoved into huts and burned.\n\nIn a short segment of the interview, which was shared on social media, Krasovsky also laughed at reports that Russian soldiers had raped elderly Ukrainian women during the invasion.\n\n\"Governments which have still not banned RT must watch this excerpt,\" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in his tweet to a clip of the interview.\n\n\"Aggressive genocide incitement (we will put this person on trial for it), which has nothing to do with freedom of speech. Ban RT worldwide,\" Kuleba added.\n\n12:50 p.m.: Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday for the second time in three days and held calls with three other counterparts from NATO countries.\n\nMoscow provided no details on the conversation with Austin, which came after the two men spoke on Friday for the first time since May. Its readouts on the other calls said Shoigu had said the situation in Ukraine was worsening.\n\n\"They discussed the situation in Ukraine which is rapidly deteriorating,\" the Russian defense ministry said of Shoigu's call with French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu. \"It is trending towards further uncontrolled escalation.\"\n\nShoigu spoke separately to Turkey's defense minister Hulusi Akar and Britain's Ben Wallace.\n\nThere was no indication from the Russian side that the conversations had produced any positive result. They showed, however, that Russia and members of the U.S.-led NATO alliance are actively maintaining channels of communication at a time of rising international concern about a possible nuclear escalation.\n\nWith Russia reeling from successive defeats in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has said it would resort to nuclear weapons if necessary to defend its \"territorial integrity.\" U.S. President Joe Biden has said the world is closer to \"Armageddon\" than at any time since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Reuters reports.\n\n12:45 p.m..: Russian missiles smashed into a suburb of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine early on Sunday, destroying two apartment blocks. Nobody was killed because most residents had already moved away after a similar attack in the vicinity six months ago.\n\n\"All of the people who had small children decided to leave immediately\" after the April attack, said Svitlana, 46, as she salvaged belongings from her glass-and-plaster strewn apartment.\n\n\"The pensioners had also decided to leave.\"\n\nHer neighbor, Oleksii Begun, 35, said only about 15-20 flats in their 119-unit, 10-storey building were currently occupied after a Russian cluster munition hit a private home nearby in April, killing one person.\n\n\"It's a horror,\" he said, surveying the devastation wrought by Sunday's attacks.\n\nThe explosions in the Karabelnyi district of Mykolaiv, a ship-building center at the confluence of the Southern Buh and Dnipro rivers, continued a weeks-long Russian aerial offensive that has targeted civilian infrastructure, especially energy facilities, just weeks before the onset of winter, Reuters reports.\n\n10:15 a.m.: Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraines military, said that Russian troops are falling back from positions on the Dnipro River in the southern Kherson region, a gateway to Crimea, CNN reports. Russia is evacuating citizens from the area, but it claims it has not lost ground to Ukraine in Kherson. \"The evacuation of the city of Kherson continues. We provide maximum assistance to all those traveling to the eastern part of the Kherson region and other subjects of the Russian Federation,\" Kirill Stremousov, a Russian-appointed official in Kherson, said Sunday.\n\n10:10 a.m.: More than military bases or transport hubs in recent weeks,Russia has bombarded Ukraines electricity distribution and heating networks, CNN reports.\n\nWith winter weeks away, Russian missile and drone strikes are hitting thermal power stations, electricity substations, transformers and pipelines leading to widespread internet outages rolling power cuts and disabled water pumping stations. Oleksandr Kharchenko, CEO of the Energy Research Center in Kyiv, said \"this is a terrorist act planned with the help of competent Russian energy experts, which aims to shut down the energy system of Ukraine. That is, to achieve a complete blackout in the country.\"\n\n9:20 a.m.: Support for funding Ukraine is eroding among Republicans, CNN reports. If Republicans win the House in the midterm elections, they pledge to take a hard look at the money the US is spending to help foot the bill to the tune of billions in security aid for Ukraines defense against Russias invasion.\n\nAccording to CNN, Kevin McCarthy, who would likely be Speaker of the House in January if Republicans win the House November, he said there will be no more \"blank check.\"\n\nAt a fundraiser in Philadelphia for Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman. President Joe Biden said McCarthys comments show todays Republicans\" have not sense of American policy,\" Biden said. He added, \"Its a lot bigger than Ukraine its Eastern Europe. Its NATO. Its real, serious, serious consequential outcomes.\"\n\n9 a.m.: Alaska's senior U.S. senator Lisa Murkowski says two Russian Indigenous Siberians were so scared of having to fight the war in Ukraine, they to take a small boat across the treacherous Bering Sea to reach American soil. The two landed earlier this month near Gambell, on Alaskas St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Strait, where they asked for asylum. The U.S. Senator says the two feared for their lives because Russia is targeting minority populations for conscription into service in Ukraine. Murkowski says she met with the two Siberians recently but didnt provide more details about exactly when or where the meeting took place or where their asylum process stood, The Associated Press reports.\n\n8:55 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War says Russias military leadership has withdrawn its officers in the Russian-annexed city of Kherson across the Dnieper River in anticipation of an advance by Ukrainian troops. It said that to delay the Ukrainian counteroffensive as the Russians complete their retreat, Moscow has left newly mobilized, inexperienced forces on the other side of the major river. On Saturday, Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine told all Kherson residents to leave immediately.\n\n8:25 a.m.: In a phone call with French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu Sunday, published by the Russian side, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow had concerns Ukraine could use a \"dirty bomb\" in the conflict. He did not offer evidence to support the suggestion that Ukraine might use such a weapon.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said in a readout of the call \"They discussed the situation in Ukraine which is rapidly deteriorating,\" and \" trending towards further uncontrolled escalation.\"\n\nA so-called dirty bomb uses conventional explosives laced with radioactive material.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry did not provide any further information on its statement.\n\n8:20 a.m.: A Russian military jet crashed into a residential building in the Siberian city of Irkutsk on Sunday and the two pilots were killed, officials said. According to Reuters, this is the second such fatal incident in six days involving a Sukhoi fighter plane.\n\nIn a post on Telegram, Irkutsk governor Igor Kobzev said the plane crashed into a two-story house in the city. He published a video showing firefighters clambering over the wreckage and directing jets of water at the still smoldering rubble.\n\nNo one on the ground was hurt, the governor said.\n\nOfficials said the plane was a Sukhoi Su-30 fighter on a test flight. Last Monday, a Sukhoi Su-34 crashed into an apartment block in the southern city of Yeysk, near Ukraine, and at least 15 people were killed.\n\nVideos of Sunday's incident, shared on social media, showed the plane dived almost vertically before crashing in a fireball, sending dense black smoke into the sky.\n\nRussia's state Investigative Committee said it had launched a criminal investigation into violations of air safety rules.\n\n5:27 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that Russian forces conducted limited counterattacks with no confirmed advances to regain lost territory in Kharkiv, Luhansk, and Donetsk oblasts on October 22.\n\nOccupation authorities in Kherson Oblast ordered civilians to evacuate east on October 21. Evacuations from Kherson City will support likely Russian plans to blow up the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Plant (HPP) dam to cover their withdrawal.\n\n4:19 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said that on October 19, Wagner Group owner Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed online that his engineering team were constructing an extensive fortified \"Wagner Line\" of defenses in Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast, and posted a map showing the planned extent of the project.\n\nThe project suggests Russia is making a significant effort to prepare defenses in depth behind the current front line, likely to deter any rapid Ukrainian counter offensives, the update said.\n\n3:08 a.m.: Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the people of her besieged nation \"are fighting for our lives\" as they battle against the Russian invasion.\n\n\"We are fighting for our lives. Our planning horizon is maybe a day or two we don't know what tomorrow is or the day after tomorrow,\" she told the audience Oct. 22 at the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany.\n\nZelenska noted that there was renewed Russian shelling on the Ukrainian capital overnight.\n\nShe said such shelling and other effects of war have led to a daily search for normalcy, mentioning concerns for her children and the dangers facing her husband.\n\n1:26 a.m.: A former owner of a prestigious aircraft engine builder in central Ukraine has been detained on treason charges, Ukrainian media reported Saturday, quoting security sources, according to Reuters.\n\nSeveral of Ukraine's most prominent media outlets said Vyacheslav Boguslaev, the \"honorary head\" of the Motor Sich company in the central city of Zaporizhzhia, had been detained and was being taken to Kyiv in a convoy.\n\nThe reports quoted security sources as saying Boguslaev, a former member of parliament, was suspected of collaborating with and assisting Russian forces occupying parts of four Ukrainian regions, including Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe city of Zaporizhzhia remains under Ukrainian control.\n\nThe reports quoted security sources as saying investigators had to break down the front door of Boguslaev's home in order to conduct a search.\n\nProminent journalist Iryna Romaliyska, writing on Facebook and also quoting security sources, said Boguslaev was known for his pro-Russian views. He was suspected, she wrote, of supplying Russia with parts for helicopters and planes and of having contacts with Russian special services.\n\nMoror Sich is a well-known manufacturer of aircraft engines and industrial turbines. Ukrainian authorities last year blocked attempts by Chinese companies to take over the firm.\n\n12:02 a.m.:\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "The global energy crisis triggered by Russias invasion of Ukraine is causing profound and long-lasting changes that have the potential to hasten the transition to a more sustainable and secure energy system, according to the latest edition of the IEAs World Energy Outlook.\n\nTodays energy crisis is delivering a shock of unprecedented breadth and complexity. The biggest tremors have been felt in the markets for natural gas, coal and electricity with significant turmoil in oil markets as well, necessitating two oil stock releases of unparalleled scale by IEA member countries to avoid even more severe disruptions. With unrelenting geopolitical and economic concerns, energy markets remain extremely vulnerable, and the crisis is a reminder of the fragility and unsustainability of the current global energy system, the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO) warns.\n\nThe WEOs analysis finds scant evidence to support claims from some quarters that climate policies and net zero commitments contributed to the run-up in energy prices. In the most affected regions, higher shares of renewables were correlated with lower electricity prices and more efficient homes and electrified heat have provided an important buffer for some consumers, albeit far from enough. The heaviest burden is falling on poorer households where a larger share of income is spent on energy.\n\nAlongside short-term measures to try to shield consumers from the impacts of the crisis, many governments are now taking longer-term steps. Some are seeking to increase or diversify oil and gas supplies, and many are looking to accelerate structural changes. The most notable responses include the US Inflation Reduction Act, the EUs Fit for 55 package and REPowerEU, Japans Green Transformation (GX) programme, Koreas aim to increase the share of nuclear and renewables in its energy mix, and ambitious clean energy targets in China and India.\n\nIn the WEOs Stated Policies Scenario, which is based on the latest policy settings worldwide, these new measures help propel global clean energy investment to more than USD 2 trillion a year by 2030, a rise of more than 50% from today. As markets rebalance in this scenario, the upside for coal from todays crisis is temporary as renewables, supported by nuclear power, see sustained gains. As a result, a high point for global emissions is reached in 2025. At the same time, international energy markets undergo a profound reorientation in the 2020s as countries adjust to the rupture of Russia-Europe flows.\n\n\"Energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russias invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come,\" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. \"Even with todays policy settings, the energy world is shifting dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system.\"\n\nFor the first time ever, a WEO scenario based on todays prevailing policy settings in this case, the Stated Policies Scenario has global demand for every fossil fuel exhibiting a peak or plateau. In this scenario, coal use falls back within the next few years, natural gas demand reaches a plateau by the end of the decade, and rising sales of electric vehicles (EVs) mean that oil demand levels off in the mid-2030s before ebbing slightly to mid-century. This means that total demand for fossil fuels declines steadily from the mid-2020s to 2050 by an annual average roughly equivalent to the lifetime output of a large oil field. The declines are much faster and more pronounced in the WEOs more climate-focused scenarios.\n\nGlobal fossil fuel use has grown alongside GDP since the start of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century: putting this rise into reverse will be a pivotal moment in energy history. The share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix in the Stated Policies Scenario falls from around 80% to just above 60% by 2050. Global CO2 emissions fall back slowly from a high point of 37 billion tonnes per year to 32 billion tonnes by 2050. This would be associated with a rise of around 2.5 C in global average temperatures by 2100, far from enough to avoid severe climate change impacts. Full achievement of all climate pledges would move the world towards safer ground, but there is still a large gap between todays pledges and a stabilisation of the rise in global temperatures around 1.5 C.\n\nTodays growth rates for deployment of solar PV, wind, EVs and batteries, if maintained, would lead to a much faster transformation than projected in the Stated Policies Scenario, although this would require supportive policies not just in the early leading markets for these technologies but across the world. Supply chains for some key technologies including batteries, solar PV and electrolysers are expanding at rates that support greater global ambition. If all announced manufacturing expansion plans for solar PV see the light of day, manufacturing capacity would exceed the deployment levels in the Announced Pledges Scenario in 2030 by around 75%. In the case of electrolysers for hydrogen production, the potential excess of capacity of all announced projects is around 50%.\n\nStronger policies will be essential to drive the huge increase in energy investment that is needed to reduce the risks of future price spikes and volatility, according to this years WEO. Subdued investment due to lower prices in the 2015-2020 period made the energy sector much more vulnerable to the sort of disruptions we have seen in 2022. While clean energy investment rises above USD 2 trillion by 2030 in the States Policies Scenario, it would need to be above USD 4 trillion by the same date in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, highlighting the need to attract new investors to the energy sector. And major international efforts are still urgently required to narrow the worrying divide in clean energy investment levels between advanced economies and emerging and developing economies.\n\n\"The environmental case for clean energy needed no reinforcement, but the economic arguments in favour of cost-competitive and affordable clean technologies are now stronger and so too is the energy security case. Todays alignment of economic, climate and security priorities has already started to move the dial towards a better outcome for the worlds people and for the planet,\" Dr Birol said.\n\n\"It is essential to bring everyone on board, especially at a time when geopolitical fractures on energy and climate are all the more visible,\" he said. \"This means redoubling efforts to ensure that a broad coalition of countries has a stake in the new energy economy. The journey to a more secure and sustainable energy system may not be a smooth one. But todays crisis makes it crystal clear why we need to press ahead.\"\n\nRussia has been by far the worlds largest exporter of fossil fuels, but its invasion of Ukraine is prompting a wholesale reorientation of global energy trade, leaving it with a much-diminished position. All Russias trade ties with Europe based on fossil fuels had ultimately been undercut in previous WEO scenarios by Europes net zero ambitions, but Russias ability to deliver at relatively low cost meant that it lost ground only gradually. Now the rupture has come with a speed that few imagined possible. Russian fossil fuel exports never return in any of the scenarios in this years WEO to the levels seen in 2021, with Russias reorientation to Asian markets particularly challenging in the case of natural gas. Russias share of internationally traded energy, which stood at close to 20% in 2021, falls to 13% in 2030 the Stated Policies Scenario, while the shares of both the United States and the Middle East rise.\n\nFor gas consumers, the upcoming Northern Hemisphere winter promises to be a perilous moment and a testing time for EU solidarity and the winter of 2023-24 could be even tougher. But in the longer term, one of the effects of Russias recent actions is that the era of rapid growth in gas demand draws to a close. In the Stated Policies Scenario, the scenario that sees the highest gas use, global demand rises by less than 5% between 2021 and 2030 and then remains flat through to 2050. Momentum behind gas in developing economies has slowed, notably in South and Southeast Asia, putting a dent in the credentials of gas as a transition fuel.\n\n\"Amid the major changes taking place, a new energy security paradigm is needed to ensure reliability and affordability while reducing emissions,\" Dr Birol said. \"That is why this years WEO provides 10 principles that can help guide policymakers through the period when declining fossil fuel and expanding clean energy systems co-exist, since both systems are required to function well during energy transitions in order to deliver the energy services needed by consumers. And as the world moves on from todays energy crisis, it needs to avoid new vulnerabilities arising from high and volatile critical mineral prices or highly concentrated clean energy supply chains\"",

Reuters\n\nKYIV, Ukraine From towns near frontline battlefields to high-rises in the capital, Ukrainians were trying to conserve energy as President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Tuesday that Russian attacks over the past eight days had destroyed 30 percent of Ukraines power stations and caused \"massive blackouts across the country.\"\n\nThe latest strikes have increased the likelihood of a miserable winter, with residents having to do without basic services such as heat and water. The World Health Organization has warned of the potential for a spiraling humanitarian crisis, given that a lack of access to fuel or electricity \"could become a matter of life or death if people are unable to heat their homes.\"\n\nThe United Nations human rights body has said that deliberate strikes on such civilian targets could constitute a war crime. Mr. Zelensky urged Ukrainians in his nightly address on Monday to reduce their electricity use during peak hours to \"enable the whole country to go through this period more stably,\" and many residents and businesses have been doing their part.\n\nIn his statement on Tuesday, he did not specify which power stations had sustained significant damage. On Tuesday, blasts hit a district on the eastern shore of the Dnipro River in Kyiv, Ukraines capital, according to the mayor, along with cities in the north and center of the country.\n\nThe strikes on Ukraine in recent weeks have targeted both electrical infrastructure and thermal power plants. Many cities and towns rely on a centralized system to heat homes, pumping water from these thermal plants though pipes that reach houses and large apartment complexes across the region.\n\nIf the plants are damaged or the pipes it could threaten heating across a wide area. Those who rely on electric heaters also risk facing a winter without proper warmth in their houses because of rolling blackouts.\n\nThe attack on Kyiv killed three people and knocked out electricity and water in parts of the city, officials said, and came one day after Russia struck the city with exploding Iranian-made drones, apparently targeting electricity and heating facilities.\n\nIn Kyiv, lights flickered just after 9 a.m., and residents living in the citys eastern reaches said they had heard an explosion. The mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said that an \"object of critical infrastructure\" had been struck. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior official in Mr. Zelenskys office, said that at least three strikes had hit an energy site, resulting in \"serious damage,\" without elaborating.\n\nVideo Video showed smoke rising near power plants in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian attacks in recent days have destroyed 30 percent of the nations power stations, causing large-scale blackouts. Credit Credit... Unknown via Storyful\n\nBy midmorning, people in Kyiv were lining up at stores to fill bottles with fresh water, and electricity suppliers warned that the city would experience blackouts while repairs were underway.\n\nRussias Defense Ministry said that it had launched long-range strikes on Tuesday targeting \"the military control and energy systems of Ukraine\" and depots storing foreign-supplied military weapons and equipment, and that \"all the assigned targets had been neutralized.\" It was not possible to verify the claim.\n\nEven as Russias forces lose ground on the battlefield to Ukrainian counteroffensives in the east and south, Moscow has stepped up its aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities, including many, like Kyiv, that lie far from the front lines.\n\nOn social media, shops, banks and other major retailers have posted photos of the measures that they are taking to reduce energy use, such as turning off illuminated signs. In the capital, some billboards are no longer lit up at night, and streetlights are being partly turned off. Still, towns and cities across Ukraine are dealing with rolling blackouts or going without power entirely.\n\nIn Washington, Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said on Tuesday that, with its latest airstrikes on Ukraines electrical grid, the Kremlin was \"obviously trying to inflict pain on the civilian society as well as try to have an impact on Ukrainian forces.\"\n\n\"But what weve seen so far is Ukraine be very resilient and their ability to get things like their power grids back up online quickly,\" General Ryder told reporters.\n\nOleksandra Mykolyshyn and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.",

                "cc_text": "The Biden Administration unveiled a new defense strategy Thursday that puts the U.S. military on a Cold War-footing with China and Russia, detailing a plan to confront two nuclear peer adversaries for the first time in history with a multi-year build-up of modernized weaponry, enhanced foreign alliances and a top-to bottom overhaul of the American nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe 80-page document serves as the Administrations roadmap for global security for the decades to come, and makes clear the U.S. faces two powerful but very different competitors. It characterizes China as a long-term \"pacing challenge\" with its growing power projection in the Pacific region, while deeming Russia to be an immediate \"acute threat\" amid its ongoing war with Ukraine and continual threats to launch a nuclear strike.\n\n\"We chose the word acute, carefully,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters at the Pentagon. \"Unlike China, Russia cant systemically challenge the United States over the long-term, but Russian aggression does pose an immediate and sharp threat to our interests and values.\" In recent weeks, Russian missile strikes on civilian targets in Ukraine and unfounded claims of a pending \"dirty bomb\" detonation have sparked fears the world is inching ever closer to the brink of nuclear war. The Administration has deep concerns about the conflict escalating, Austin said, but remains committed to continuing to support Ukraine with weapons and the means to defend itself.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly discussed the possible use of nuclear weapons in the eight-month-old war and this week observed nuclear drills, called Grom or \"Thunder\" exercises, involving Russian submarines, bombers and ballistic missile launches inside Russia. Austin shot-down speculation that the war games were subterfuge for a real nuclear attack, saying U.S. intelligence had not observed any indication that such preparations were taking place. He added that senior Russian officials had privately said there are no plans to use a nuclear device in Ukraine, but the U.S. remained cautious.\n\n\"It would be the first time that a nuclear weapon has been used in over 70 years, so that certainly has a potential of changing things in the international community,\" Austin said. \"Were going to continue to communicate that any type of use of a weapon of that sort, or even the talk of the use of a weapon of that sort, is dangerous and irresponsible.\"\n\nRead More: Fears Over Military Miscalculation Grow In Ukraine\n\nChina, meanwhile, is depicted in the strategy document as the \"most consequential strategic competitor for the coming decades.\" The U.S. says Beijing is actively seeking to weaken U.S. alliances with Asian partners, building up its military and nuclear forces and threatening invasion of the U.S.-allied island of Taiwan. China \"is the only competitor out there with both the intent to reshape the international order, and increasingly the power to do so,\" Austin said.\n\nThe Administration has determined that Beijing is planning a threefold increase in nuclear warheads to 1,000 by 2030, while simultaneously constructing hundreds of new silos capable of launching long-range ballistic missiles, potentially targeting the U.S. and its far-flung nuclear forces. While the U.S. has more than 10 to 1 advantage over China in the number of nuclear warheads and the weapons to deliver them, the Pentagon sees a need to prepare for the decades ahead. The Chinese nuclear build-up is an unprecedented challenge for the military, which since the end of World War II has only had to focus on deterring one near-peer adversaryformerly the Soviet Union, now Russiafrom launching a nuclear attack.\n\n\"I do not want to suggest that this is a solved or closed problem and that we now have the answers,\" a senior defense official, who wasnt authorized to speak publicly on the matter, told reporters. \"This is new territory for us How do you successfully fight one adversary, while having enough reserve to hold the other bay? And just the second part of that cannot be a solution where if China has 1,000 (nuclear warheads) and Russia has 1,000, that we need 2,000, because that is an arms race that nobody should want to be in.\"\n\nRead More: Inside the $100 Billion Mission to Modernize Americas Aging Nuclear Missiles\n\nThe strategy laid out by Austin largely breaks from President Joe Bidens campaign pledge to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy. There are a few nods in the direction of disarmament, including directives to stop developing a nuclear-armed sea launched cruise missiles, retire the largest gravity bomb, the B83, in the U.S. arsenal, and eliminate the declared policy to hold onto nuclear weapons as a \"hedge against an uncertain future.\" But there is no drastic change that non-proliferation experts were hoping for.\n\n\"It largely continues the nuclear deterrence strategy and posture, including capability added in the Trump Administration. It is unclear how it reduces the role of nuclear weapons as the President directed,\" says Leonor Tomero, who served as Bidens Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for nuclear and missile defense before leaving in October 2021. \"There is an urgent need to reduce the risk of nuclear war, especially at a time when nuclear tensions are higher than they have been for years.\"\n\nThe risks of miscalculation and of unintended rapid escalation could lead to nuclear weapons use, Tomero says. \"These new threats require clear solutions and practical steps to adapt and strengthen deterrence to reduce these risks,\" she says.\n\nRight now, the U.S. and Russia are limited on the number of strategic warheads and delivery systems until February 2026 under a bilateral treaty known as New START. China, however, is not part of that agreement and has shown no signs of wanting to rein in their nuclear weapons programs, which raises questions about whether continued nuclear arms reductions by other countries will be possible.\n\n\"There are repeated references to adjusting U.S. posture in the future, which tees-up a future Administration to increase the size of the arsenal or resume nuclear testing,\" says Jeffrey Lewis, an analyst with the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies.\n\nThe advancement of non-nuclear weapons systems, such as hypersonic missiles, as well as space-based and cyber capabilities are also concerning to the administration. The strategy calls for \"building enduring advantages,\" involving investments in the Defense Departments workforce, improvements in weapons-buying processes and preparing for climate change. Other challenges discussed in the document emanate from Iran and North Korea, and \"violent extremist organizations,\" which is military jargon for terrorist groups.\n\nThe Biden teams focus on Moscow and Beijing is consistent with the U.S. national security complexs desire to pivot from the morass of violence and counter-terrorism operations in the Middle East and engage in Great Power competition. Each Administration is mandated by Congress to issue a new national defense strategy every four years, and two versions are drawn up: one secret, one public. The document released Oct. 27 marked the first time the strategy also included the so-called Nuclear Posture Review and Missile Defense Review, which shape funding allocations for the coming years. \"By weaving these documents together,\" Austin said, \"we help ensure that the entire department is moving forward together and matching our resources to our goals.\"\n\nWrite to W.J.

They are known as \"kamikaze\" drones because they are destroyed in the attack - named after the Japanese fighter pilots who flew suicide missions in World War Two.\n\nUkraine says around 400 drones have already been used by Russia, from a total order of roughly 2,000 weapons.\n\nBut Tehran has repeatedly denied that it has struck any arms deal with the Kremlin, and Moscow also denies using Iranian drones.\n\nOn Wednesday, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian called the accusations \"baseless\" and urged Ukraine to \"present any evidence supporting the accusations\".\n\n\"If... it becomes clear to us that Russia has used Iranian drones in the war against Ukraine, we will definitely not be indifferent about this issue,\" he added.\n\nTehran's regional adversary, Israel, has also attacked Iran over the alleged exports. During a meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday, President Isaac Herzog slammed the regime's activities.\n\n\"The fact that Iran, following its activities in killing its own citizens, in working towards nuclear weapons endlessly, endangering the entire world and the region and now killing innocent civilians in Ukraine, clearly that gives you a picture of what Iran is all about,\" Mr Herzog said.\n\nPrior to the visit, he had pledged to share \"proof\" with Mr Biden that Iran was supplying the weapons.\n\nMeanwhile, US officials have said they will supply Ukraine with an additional $275m (237m) of military aid, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe assistance is expected to be used to restock ammunition for Ukrainian artillery systems, including the HIMARS launchers that Kyiv's forces have used to great effect.\n\nOn the ground, fighting has slowed in recent days, with a much anticipated Ukrainian advance on the southern city of Kherson stalled due to poor weather.",

The consequences of this are very dangerous, again for all of us in Europe,\" Zelenskyy said in an address to the EU council\n\nEnergy-saving measures were put in place across the country after Russian missile and drone strikes destroyed at least 30% of the countrys power stations in a week, according to authorities.\n\nFollowing blackouts in parts of Kyiv overnight, the citys mayor Vitali Klitschko urged businesses to limit screens and signage lights \"as much as possible\".\n\n\"Even small savings and a reduction in electricity consumption in every home will help stabilise the operation of the national energy system,\" he said.\n\nUkrainians responded defiantly.\n\n\"Its not going to change our attitude, maybe we will only hate them more,\" said Olga, a resident of Dnipro in central Ukraine who declined to give her last name.\n\n\"I would rather sit in the cold with no water and electricity than be in Russia,\" she said.\n\nPeople were rushing to buy auxiliary power supplies like generators and batteries, according to Kyrylo, an electronics vendor.\n\nSpeaking of the coming winter, he said: \"I think that there will be nothing that we cannot survive.\"\n\n\"There will be some kind of heating in any case, and the fact that it will be 16 degrees Celsius instead of 20 doesnt matter much. Just put on a thermal and socks,\" he said.\n\nIranians on the ground\n\nThe White House meanwhile said it had evidence of Iranians taking a direct role in the war, helping Russians direct their Iranian-made \"kamikaze drones\" which are destroyed in attacks on Ukrainian targets such as power stations.\n\n\"Tehran is now directly engaged on the ground, and through the provision of weapons that are impacting civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby.\n\nHe added that there was also concern Iran might supply surface-to-surface missiles to Russia for use in the war.\n\n\"The United States is going to pursue all means to expose, deter and confront Irans provision of these munitions against the Ukrainian people,\" he added.\n\nThe European Union and United Kingdom announced sanctions on three Iranian generals and an arms firm accused of supplying Russia with drones.\n\nEU agrees sanctions over Iranian kamikaze drones in Ukraine EU member states agreed on Thursday (20 October) on fresh sanctions against three individuals and one entity for supplying Iranian drones that have been used by Russia to bomb Ukraine in recent weeks.\n\nHowever, bipartisan support for military aid to Ukraine is starting to wane in Washington, with Republicans signalling that funding could be cut after congressional midterm elections next month.\n\n\"They said that if they win theyre not likely to fund, to continue to fund Ukraine,\" US President Joe Biden said while campaigning in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"They have no sense of American foreign policy.\"\n\nKherson evacuation\n\nLittle changed along the long front lines, where Russia has been sending many of the 200,000 troops newly called up to the fight.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday visited a training centre for mobilised troops south-east of Moscow where he embraced soldiers and fired a gun.\n\nWhile @ZelenskyyUa meets soldiers on the frontlines, Putin climbed out of his bunker and went to visit mobilized men. For some reason he didn't come to Donbas but chose Ryazan, close to Moscow. He tried a Russian sniper gun.

Nobody left. We see it and dont believe them,\" he told Corriere della Sera, an Italian newspaper, on Thursday.\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman who spent months on the southern front lines says the Russian media buzz is too pre-calculated and loud to be true.\n\n\"We are not falling for it, because its too deliberate and designed to create media buzz, to create a certain mood,\" the serviceman told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.\n\nThere is no hope for a miraculous retreat of Russians from such a strategic region, and Ukraines top brass needs to concentrate on improving the living conditions on Khersons front line, in the bare, windblown steppes that offer no shelter from the elements and Russian shelling, he said.\n\n\"A lot more has to be invested in the survival of the existing manpower,\" he said.\n\nIntelligence data and satellite photos show that, in recent days, Russians have been building fortifications and defensive lines in the regional capital, also named Kherson, and Nova Kakhovka, the town next to the dam and hydropower station.\n\n\"The evacuation of civilian residents from the [Dniepers] right bank to the left one is all preparations and propaganda tricks,\" Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of Ukraines general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"In fact, theyre strengthening their grouping there, with manpower. Theres more of it,\" he said.\n\nThe grouping is even getting ready for a possible counterattack, he said.\n\nIn the first days of the invasion, Moscow hoped that its blitzkrieg would topple Zelenskyys government. But after weeks of heavy resistance and failures, it withdrew its forces from northern Ukraine and around Kyiv.\n\nMoscow hoped to advance in the east and south to seize Ukraines Black Sea coast and pave the way to the breakaway pro-Moscow region of Transnistria, in neighbouring Moldova, where Russian \"peacekeepers\" have been stationed for years.\n\nThese hopes have failed too as Ukraine has liberated most of the eastern region of Kharkiv, dealt heavy blows to Russian forces in Luhansk and Donetsk, and started retaking parts of Kherson.\n\nIn recent days, heavy rains and muddy roads became another factor that slowed Ukraines advance, Romanenko said.\n\nHowever, small groups of Ukrainian troops are constantly pin-pricking the Russians destroying command centres, depots, and supply routes and preventing the delivery of manpower, he said.\n\nThe timing of a decisive advance is yet to be determined.\n\n\"We have to identify the enemys weak spots, we have to gather reserves, increase our potential and only then make final decisions for more action,\" he said.\n\nPro-Moscow figures claim that Russias recent decision to mobilise 300,000 men and destroy key Ukrainian infrastructure with cruise missiles, rockets and drones means Kyiv has no choice but to hastily move forward in Kherson.\n\n\"[Ukraine] is forced to hurry with an advance while its rear structures remain operational,\" Igor Strelkov, a former \"defence minister\" in separatist Donetsk, who recently returned to the front line, wrote on Telegram on Sunday.\n\nAnother analyst said Ukraines stalled advance reflects its manpower shortages and its increasingly cautious strategy of inching forward small groups.\n\n\"It can advance only after identifying sizeable breaches in the Russian defence,\" Nikolay Mitrokhin, a Russia researcher at Germanys Bremen University, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAlmost daily, the Ukrainian army suffers heavy losses, according to Russian reports, but keeps looking for new \"holes\", he said.\n\n\"Such holes appear as a result of effective artillery fire or operation of drones, so, there are chances\" for further gains, he said.\n\nHowever, Russia promptly fills the holes with thousands of newly-mobilised troops even though they have next to no training and combat experience.\n\n\"Thats why Ukraine keeps hoping that its push-out tactics of hitting the rear, headquarters and the destruction of enemy manpower on the front line with artillery or drones that drop little bombs right on the soldiers heads will gradually work,\" Mitrokhin said.",

If you say you are worried about escalation, arent convinced that Russian President Vladimir Putins ultimate goal is to restore the old Soviet empire, and voice concerns that the war is a costly and potentially dangerous distraction from other foreign-policy priorities, then youll probably be accused of being an appeaser, an apologist for Moscow, or something even worse.

If you say you are worried about escalation, arent convinced that Russian President Vladimir Putins ultimate goal is to restore the old Soviet empire, and voice concerns that the war is a costly and potentially dangerous distraction from other foreign-policy priorities, then youll probably be accused of being an appeaser, an apologist for Moscow, or something even worse. By contrast, if you favor open-ended Western support for Ukraine, dismiss the possibility of escalation, and believe the war must continue until Russia suffers a decisive defeat and Putin is ousted, your critics will denounce you as a warmonger whose disregard for costs and risks could get us all vaporized.\n\nThis level of vituperation is not conducive to a serious discussion of alternative perspectives and policy options at a time when uncertainty is rife and weighing the costs and benefits of different courses of action carefully is critical. Humility, empathy, and attention to logic and evidence should be the worlds guiding principles, but these traits are hard to sustain when war is raging, people are dying, and passions are inflamed.\n\nIf we step back a bit, however, the debate on Ukraine can be seen as an illustration of a long-standing divide in foreign-policy circles. This divide was evident in debates on Vietnam in the 1960s and over the decision to invade Iraq in 2003. These competing worldviews are also fundamental to the policy differences between advocates of energetic U.S. interventionism and those who favor greater foreign-policy restraint.\n\nThose who favor open-ended support for Ukraine see the world as highly interconnected and sensitive to small changes. In this view, international order is a fragile thinglike a financial market where a bit of bad news can spark panic and trigger a total market meltdown. For those who think this way, even minor setbacks can destroy a great powers reputation, lead its allies to switch sides and bandwagon with an opponent, embolden revisionist powers, and produce rapid and far-reaching changes in the international order.\n\nBy the same logic, advocates of this view also tend to believe that even modest victories can produce big benefits in other areas and issues. If the United States comes out on top in some international dispute, allies around the world will supposedly be reassured, potential aggressors will be deterred for years, and the existing order will be reinforced. If the United States loses or even compromises, however, look out.\n\nFrom this perspective, if Russia gets anything out of the war, then Putins appetite will grow ever larger, and he is likely to think he can keep blackmailing the West into giving him whatever he wants. The United States and NATO will lose credibility, wars of conquest will once again be seen as legitimate tools of statecraft, China will decide it can take Taiwan whenever it wants, any semblance of a \"rules-based order\" will collapse, and woe will be us. But if Russia is soundly defeated and Putin is retired (to put it politely), then revisionists around the world will learn once again that aggression does not pay. Ukrainian democracy will flourish, liberalism will get a new lease on life around the world, China will stand down over Taiwan, inflation will subside, and happy days will be here again.\n\nOne can understand why the Ukrainian government and its most fervent supporters in the West tend to purvey this view. If compromise would lead to all these horrible outcomes and victory would bring such tremendous benefits, then giving Ukraine whatever it needs to achieve its war aims seems like the obvious thing to do. This is the classic formula for starting or continuing a war: You try to convince people that doing more will bring great benefits at a reasonable cost and that failing to do so will lead to disaster. Given that, in this case, we are dealing with a nuclear-armed adversary, those who embrace this view also tend to argue that Putins nuclear threats are signs of desperation and warn against succumbing to nuclear blackmail. Not surprisingly, this is the official view from Kyiv.\n\nBut heres the rub: If Putin and his advisors are thinking along similar linesand theres reason to believe that they arethen they also have a bit of an incentive to continue the war (and maybe escalate it if they are losing). If Putin sees the world the same way that Western hawks do, then he believes defeat in Ukraine would consign Russia to the second rank of world powers, make China question Russias value as an ally, reinforce U.S. global dominance, and quite possibly threaten his regime and personal survival. And he may still hold out hope that a compromise for peace, which kept Ukraine from becoming a de facto Western ally and struck a blow against what he sees as a U.S.-led effort to weaken Russia, would vindicate his original decision to go to war and justify the enormous price that Russia has paid for his miscalculations and incompetence.\n\nThe bottom line is more that key decision-makers on both sides view the war as an all-or-nothing struggle with far-reaching global implicationsworsening the risk of dangerous escalation the longer it lasts. If you want to understand how that might happen, check out the European Council on Foreign Relations Jeremy Shapiros depressing take here.\n\nBut there is another way to think about this whole issue. If you believe world events are only imperfectly interconnected, then what happens in Ukraine is important but not likely to determine the fate of the planet. In this view, dramatic shifts of the sort described above happen rarelyand typically only when a great power collapses entirely and the entire structure of world politics is transformed. Most of the time, states adjust their policies to try to keep the strongest power(s) in check, balances of power tend to reform, and even one-sided victories typically create new problems rather than perpetual peace.\n\nPeople who see the world this way agree that helping Ukraine defend itself is desirable on both moral and strategic grounds and that outside support should continue. But however much they might applaud a Ukrainian victory and the removal of all Russian troops from Ukrainian soil, they dont think the question of who controls the Donbas will have much impact on Chinas policy toward Taiwan, Irans nuclear decision-making, the refugee crisis in Africa and Central America, or the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. They suspect rifts in Europe will continue even if Ukraine is triumphant and that these divisions are likely to increase once todays heightened fears of Russia diminish. A defeated Russia would be chastened for a while, but new Russian leaders might be as uncomfortable with U.S. dominance as Putin has been and still capable of mischief-making in several places. The internal challenges facing the democracies of the West would not disappear after a victory parade in Kyiv, and local rivalries and conflicting interests would continue to bedevil anyone who is foolish enough to try to dictate the political evolution of a diverse and divided planet.\n\nIf you think this way, it follows that victory in Ukraine, while desirable, is not going to solve all the worlds problems. Similarly, failure to inflict a traumatic defeat on Russia would not be a catastrophic blow to the global balance of power or the evolving world order. Even if Russia somehow manages to hang on to Crimea and maybe some parts of the Donbas, it is going to get substantially weaker over time, and theres very little Putin (or a successor) can do about that.\n\nWhich of these two sharply contrasting worldviews is correct? Although I believe modern history strongly supports the second alternative, the conflict over Ukraine could be an exception to the balancing tendencies Ive described. I cant prove that the hard-liners are wrong either about Putins willingness to escalate or the broader consequences of what happens in Ukraine. Nor can they prove that the less alarmist view Ive sketched is wrong.\n\nBut I continue to believe that a far more important issue for the future world order is whether the United States continues to dominate the commanding heights of the world economy or gradually surrenders that position to China as well as whether humankind can keep climate change from rendering these other problems trivial by comparison. What happens in Ukraine wont affect these issues that much unless a prolonged war becomes a costly distraction for the United States and a growing burden on its European allies, even as China buys cut-rate oil and gas and remains happily aloof from yet another costly and dangerous global conflict.\n\nThe other way the war in Ukraine could exert a dramatic effect on world politics, of course, would be a shattering of the nuclear taboo, especially if this step leads to a significant nuclear exchange. The Biden administration seems to be more mindful of this danger than some of the people who are egging it on, which is a good thing. Id like to think that people with sharply contrasting worldviews could still agree that a nuclear war would ruin everyones day and that there are no political objectives that would justify it.",

He provided no evidence to back up his accusations.\n\nHe said he was \"concerned about possible provocations by Kyiv involving the use of a dirty bomb\".\n\nOther top Russian commanders made the same allegation.\n\nBut in a joint statement, the foreign ministers of France, the UK and the US said their governments \"all reject Russia's transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory\", stressing that they would continue supporting Ukraine in \"the face of President [Vladimir] Putin's brutal war of aggression\".\n\nMilitary analysts note that the Russian accusations come after a string of heavy Russian military defeats and as Ukrainian troops continue their counter-offensive operations in the east and south of the country.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February 30-nation Nato has provided Kyiv with billions of dollars' worth of weapons and military training, but it refuses to intervene directly - with air support or troops - as Ukraine is not a member.\n\nPresident Zelensky accused Russia of being \"the source of everything dirty that can be imagined in this war\".\n\nHe said Russia was threatening the world \"with a radiation disaster\" at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant which it had captured, and also spoke of Moscow's threats to detonate a major dam in southern Ukraine. The Kremlin denies the allegations.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader said \"the world should react in the toughest possible way\".\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Wallace said he rejected Mr Shoigu's allegations that \"Ukraine was planning actions facilitated by Western countries, including the UK, to escalate the conflict in Ukraine\".\n\nHe also cautioned that such claims \"should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation\".\n\nThe US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in a series of tweets that Mr Shoigu \"likely sought to slow or suspend Western military aid to Ukraine and possibly weaken the Nato alliance in scare-mongering calls\".\n\nHowever, the ISW added: \"The Kremlin is unlikely to be preparing an imminent false-flag dirty bomb attack. Shoigu's claims further a longstanding Russian information campaign.\"\n\nIn other developments on Sunday:",

Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse Getty Images\n\nPower has again been restored at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility, reducing worries about an accident at one of the wars most sensitive sites. But the head of the United Nations atomic watchdog warned that Ukrainian workers were under yet more intense pressure as Moscow tries to assert further control of the plant.\n\nWhile Ukrainian engineers have continued to operate the plant under the watch of Russian soldiers, Moscow recently said it was nationalizing the facility. The effort is part of a broader bid to claim, in a parade of formalities designed to give the moves a sheen of legitimacy, that parts of Ukraine are now Russian. The nuclear plant sits in one of four Ukrainian provinces that President Vladimir V. Putin declared this month had been annexed to Russia a move that has been widely rejected and condemned as illegal.\n\nLate Friday, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a statement that employees at the nuclear plant were now facing \"unacceptable pressure\" to sign employment contracts with the Russian nuclear energy company, Rosatom, in defiance of Kyiv.\n\nThat pressure only adds to the stresses on the workers that Ukrainian officials have been warning about for months, saying that Russian soldiers had subjected already fatigued staff to harsh interrogations and torture.\n\nHolding the plant gives Moscow a military advantage but also significant leverage over Ukraines energy infrastructure. Russian authorities could also, in theory, connect the facility to their grid, funneling power south to Ukrainian territory that Moscow has seized.\n\nAmid the continuing management struggle between Moscow and Kyiv, Ukraines nuclear power company said this week that Russia had kidnapped another senior official from the plant, expressing fears he could be forced to disclose information about Ukrainian personnel working there. The head of the plant had previously been detained and released.\n\nUkraines state energy company, Energoatom, said on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday that it had set up a hotline for workers at the plant that could be used by \"everyone who has information about cases of kidnapping and torture\" by Russian authorities.\n\nDespite Russias claims to have nationalized the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency says that it views the plant as Ukrainian, since the U.N. charter does not recognize illegal annexations.\n\nIn a \"much-needed development,\" the Ukrainian engineers who have been working at the Zaporizhzhia site under intense Russian pressure have managed to restore backup power, ending the plants reliance on diesel generators. Most nuclear power plants consider diesel generators a last line of defense to be used only in extreme circumstances.\n\nIt was the second time in recent days that shelling had cut power lines that feed the cooling systems for the plants six reactors, all of which are shut down.\n\nThe war marks the first time that a nuclear facility has become an active battle zone. Russia has stationed troops and artillery at the plant since seizing it in March. Ukrainian authorities say the Russians have shelled nearby cities from the plants grounds, aware of the risk of returning fire. A waste storage site has been hit several times, and power lines have been a frequent target. Each side has blamed the other for the attacks.\n\n\"Working in very challenging conditions, operating staff at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant are doing everything they can to bolster its fragile off-site power situation,\" Mr. Grossi said. \"Restoring the backup power connection is a positive step in this regard, even though the overall nuclear safety and security situation remains precarious.\"\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant is not providing electricity to Ukraines grid, given that its reactors are shut down. But it needs its own power source for safety reasons. Workers have been wrestling for weeks with how to provide that.\n\nMr. Grossi said that efforts to restart one of the reactors for that purpose would begin on Saturday in a process that would take several days. In addition, more diesel fuel has arrived, from both the Ukrainian and Russian side of the front line, to power Zaporizhzhias generators for at least 10 days should the plant again be cut off, he said.",

Just over one in four (26%) favor negotiating to end it as soon as possible.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nGallup collected these data Sept. 2-11 across all regions of Ukraine, including the Donbas, as the country's military successfully retook swathes of Russian-held territory but before the recent retaliatory missile attacks across the country.\n\nAt that time, majorities of Ukrainians from all major demographic subgroups favored continued fighting to win the war. However, there are substantial differences in the levels of support among these groups. One of the largest divides is by gender, with 76% of Ukrainian men in favor of fighting the war until it is won, compared with 64% of women who say the same.\n\nSupport for continuing to fight is stronger in regions farthest from the ground war and weaker in parts of Ukraine where people are closest to the action. Backing for the war effort is highest in places such as the country's capital, Kyiv (83%), and in the West (82%), Central (78%) and North (75%) regions of the country. Much smaller majorities in the country's East (56%) and South (58%) support continuing the war.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nWhat Does Victory Mean to Ukrainians?\n\nUkrainians who said their country should fight on until victory were asked a follow-up question about what would have to happen for Ukraine to declare victory. About nine in 10 (91%) said that victory would entail Ukrainian forces retaking all territory that Russia has seized since 2014, including Crimea.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nBottom Line\n\nAmid the success of Ukraine's counteroffensive that started in late August, the country's public is tremendously optimistic about continuing to fight the war until victory is achieved and what that victory would look like. While the Ukrainians have tasted victory on the battlefield, the war is far from over.\n\nThe most recent spate of Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns, far behind the front lines, have focused on civilian infrastructure. And, while ballistic missile attacks in the past have not broken the will of civilian populations to fight, Ukrainians' attitudes may shift if they are faced with a cold, dark winter due to the Russian attacks on infrastructure and increasing energy costs -- or, alternatively, such continued attacks may further strengthen the resolve of the population to fight.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on Twitter.\n\nFor complete methodology and specific survey dates, please review Gallup's Country Data Set details.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup World Poll works.",

                "cc_text": "Losing on the battlefield, Russian President Vladimir Putin has resorted to implied threats of nuclear weapons use in his war of choice in Ukraine. The United States, Group of Seven (G7) nations, NATO, and the European Union (EU) have responded to his brinksmanship by reaffirming support for Ukraine and its territorial integrity.\n\nAdditionally, the United States and others have sent public (and, reportedly, private) messages on the severe consequences Russia will face if it indeed uses any type of nuclear weapon against Ukraine. Although unlikely, the chances of Russian use of nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine are not negligible. After all, Putin surprised many (though not the US government) when he launched his February 24 offensive against Ukraine.\n\nLaying out for the Russians the consequences of any nuclear use is a good idea. Those conversations must necessarily focus on military options as the most effective deterrent, but should not end with them. Even though Putin has eschewed traditional rational actor behavior in the political and economic sphere with his unprovoked and gruesome invasion of Ukraine, the West should still threaten severe political and economic steps in response to any Russian nuclear use. All these measures should be prepared for rapid application by the G7 and coordinated to at least some extent with other key countries, including China. Russias use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine would demand a fast, near-immediate response by a broad coalition of concerned states beyond just the current Western-aligned nations.\n\nImpose a full economic, financial, and trade embargo. Turning Russia into Iran or North Korea, economically, should be the moral and logical starting point for any Russian use of a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The G7 and EU countries have imposed extraordinary sanctions thus far over Russias invasion of Ukraine, but in large part, they have also been measured in their steps to avoid negative spillover to the global economy. Any nuclear weapon use by Putin in Ukraine must eviscerate any thoughts of a measured escalatory ladder. Morally, it would place Russias behavior far beyond the atrocities committed by similarly embargoed nations such as Iran, Syriaand even North Korea. Logically, it would also be incongruous for the West to hope that Russia under Putin can be a reliable participant in an international economic order that relies on mutually agreed-upon rules.\n\nThere may need to be some allowances for an extended wind-down of certain trade sectors (energy and perhaps some specified metals) and longer exemptions for continued food-related and medical trade, including Russian exports of grain and fertilizer. There would need to be carve-outs for humanitarian contingencies and measures to support the Russian people, such as authorizing communications apps and devices that allow beleaguered Russian dissidents and human-rights activists to communicate with the outside world. However, the baseline assumption for the day after Russian use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine should be that of a complete embargo: All Russian companies would be considered under full blocking sanctions with exceptions available. The overseas property of Russian oligarchs or Russian state companies should be made subject to nationalization.\n\nEnforcement would include broad use of secondary sanctions against any foreign persons or nations, China included, that violate such sanctions. This would include the rapid imposition of sanctions on any bank, insurance company, logistics provider, or other financial or non-financial entity trading with Russia or facilitating prohibited trade. Given Russias use of practices to hide investments and their ownership, the United States, EU, United Kingdom, and G7 countries should consider regulatory (preferably) or legislative action forcing transparency and disclosure of any Russian investment or other significant ownership whether in a company, real estate, art, or financial instruments. The Russian state is familiar with money laundering and would almost certainly become more akin to a criminal enterprise, like North Korea, than a normal government, if it is placed under broad economic sanctions.\n\nSanctions on this level will have a significant, negative impact on the global economy. However, it is unlikely that they would be much more economically destabilizing than the use of a nuclear weapon on European soil. Western nations must make clear to Putin and his inner circle that they are ready to bear the economic consequences.\n\nSeize Russian state assets. Within days of Putins February 24 attack on Ukraine, G7 countries locked down over three hundred billion dollars of Russian foreign-exchange reserves held in their countries. That effective freeze does not, however, allow the use of those funds for any purpose. We have noted elsewhere that there is widespread desire to make use of those funds for Ukraines reconstruction, given both Russias responsibility for the war and the problem of asking the taxpayers of G7 countries to pay to rebuild Ukraine while sitting on large amounts of Russian state funds.\n\nThere are enormous legal complications in doing so, however. Russian nuclear use would make taking those assets for use in Ukraine, including post-nuclear attack reconstruction, an immediate objective. Arguments over precedent should and probably would give way to a categoric imperative of acting against nuclear weapons use.\n\nRemove Russia from international organizations. Although Russia was kicked out of the G8thus making it the G7back in 2014, it remains party to a number of international organizations. Should Russia use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, its participation in other international organizations should be reviewed. The first place to begin curtailing Moscows participation should be in economically focused organizations, including the Group of Twenty (G20) and international financial institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), and perhaps even the World Trade Organization. Expelling or curtailing membership in any of these bodies would be unprecedented and, interestingly, not explicitly in violation of their existing bylaws. Therefore, expelling Russia would entail a complex political and bureaucratic undertaking, and require substantial support of the governing members of each institution; the IMF would require at least 85 percent of voting members to agree to expel Russia, for instance. Political support for such a drastic action may be more forthcoming following a Russian nuclear strike.\n\nThere may be good arguments for keeping Russia engaged in international political organizations such as the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, as venues for potentially valuable diplomacy with the Kremlin even after nuclear weapons use. However, Russias membership even in those groups should be reviewed and reconsidered in light of such a dramatic escalation.\n\nNow is the time to consider and prepare such severe responses, and to coordinate them ahead of time within existing G7 and transatlantic forums. There should be no illusions about the lengths to which Putin will go in Ukraine.\n\nThe Wests planned responses need not be made public but could usefully be communicated both to the Russian government and to other strategically important nations that stayed relatively neutral in the current conflict, such as China, India, Turkey, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut this planning shouldnt preclude the United States and its allies from responding to the horrors Putin is inflicting right now with conventional weapons. They should prepare for the worst while continuing to intensify current efforts across the boardmilitary, economic, and politicalto constrain Russia and help Ukraine defend itself and prevail.\n\nBrian OToole is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Councils GeoEconomics Center.

It carries a small warhead that explodes on impact.\n\nFateh-110 and Zolfaghar are Iranian short-range surface to surface ballistic missiles capable of striking targets at distances of between 300 km and 700 km (186 and 435 miles).\n\nThe Iranian diplomat rejected assertions by Western officials that such transfers breach a 2015 U.N. Security Council resolution.\n\n\"Where they are being used is not the seller's issue. We do not take sides in the Ukraine crisis like the West. We want an end to the crisis through diplomatic means,\" the diplomat said.\n\nUkraine has reported a spate of Russian attacks using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in recent weeks. Iran's foreign ministry on Tuesday dismissed as baseless reports of Iran supplying drones and other weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine, while the Kremlin on Tuesday denied its forces had used Iranian drones to attack Ukraine.\n\nAsked if Russia had used Iranian drones in its campaign in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin did not have any information about their use.\n\n\"Russian equipment with Russian nomenclature is used,\" he said. \"All further questions should be directed to the Defence Ministry.\"\n\nThe ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe appearance of Iranian missiles in addition to drones in Moscow's arsenal in the war with Ukraine would raise tensions between Iran and the United States and other Western powers.\n\nSHIPMENT 'SOON, VERY SOON'\n\nThe U.S. State Department assessed that Iranian drones were used on Monday in a morning rush hour attack on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, a U.S. official said. White House spokesperson Karinne Jean-Pierre also accused Tehran of lying when it said Iranian drones are not being used by Russia in Ukraine.\n\nA European diplomat said it was his country's assessment that Russia was finding it more difficult to produce weaponry for itself given the sanctions on its industrial sector and so was turning to imports from partners like Iran and North Korea.\n\n\"Drones and missiles are a logical next step,\" said the European diplomat.\n\nAsked about sales of Iranian surface-to-surface missiles to Russia, a senior U.S. military official said: \"I don't have anything to provide at this time in terms of whether or not that is accurate at this point.\"\n\n[1/4]A view of drones during a military exercise in an undisclosed location in Iran, in this handout image obtained on August 24, 2022. Iranian Army/WANA (West Asia News Agency)/Handout via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nChafing under Western economic sanctions, Iran's rulers are keen to strengthen strategic ties to Russia against an emerging, U.S.-backed Gulf Arab-Israeli bloc that could shift the Middle East balance of power further away from the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe top commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami said last month some of the \"world's major powers\" are willing to purchase military and defence equipment from Iran.\n\nRahim Safavi, a military adviser to Irans Supreme leader, was reported by state media on Tuesday as saying that 22 countries want to buy Iranian drones.\n\nIran's rulers are also under pressure from nationwide demonstrations which were ignited by the death in custody of a 22-year-old woman detained for \"inappropriate attire\".\n\nSeveral European Union states on Monday called for sanctions on Iran over its supply of drones to Russia, as the bloc agreed a separate set of sanctions over Tehran's crackdown on unrest.\n\n\"They (Russians) wanted to buy hundreds of our missiles, even mid-range ones, but we told them that we can ship soon a few hundred of their demanded Zolfaghar and Fateh 110 short-range, surface to surface missiles,\" said one of the security officials.\n\n\"I cannot give you the exact time, but soon, very soon those will be shipped in 2 to three shipments.\"\n\nAn Eastern European official tracking Russia's weapons activity said it was their understanding that this arms deal was happening, although he had no specific evidence to back it up. The official said that a decision had been taken by the Iranian and Russian leaders to proceed with the transfer.\n\nMoscow had specifically asked for surface to surface short-range Fateh 110 and Zolfaghar missiles, and the shipment will happen in a maximum of 10 days, said another Iranian diplomat.\n\nATTACK DRONES\n\nThe stakes are high for Iran, which has been negotiating with Western states to revive a 2015 deal that would ease sanctions on Tehran in return for limits on its nuclear work.\n\nThe talks have deadlocked, and any disputes between Tehran and Western powers over arms sales to Russia or Iran's crackdown on the unrest could weaken efforts to seal an accord.\n\nThe United States agrees with British and French assessments that Iran supplying drones to Russia would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution that endorsed the 2015 deal, U.S. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said on Monday.\n\nThe Western official, who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the matter, said that like the drones, missile transfers would also violate U.N. resolution 2231.\n\nSeveral senior Iranian officials are outraged about \"unjust\" planned sanctions on Iran over its arms shipments to Russia, said the second diplomat.\n\nIn September, Tehran had refused a request by President Vladimir Putin for the supply of Iran's sophisticated Arash 2 long-range attack drones, three Iranian officials told Reuters.\n\nWhen asked the reason for the refusal, one of the officials cited several issues including \"some technical problems\".\n\n\"Also the (Revolutionary) Guards' commanders were worried that if Russia uses this Arash 2 drone in Ukraine, Americans may have access to our technology.\"\n\nWriting by Michael Georgy, Editing by William Maclean\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times\n\nRussia on Saturday said that it was suspending its participation in an agreement to export grain and other agricultural products from Ukrainian ports, upending a deal that was intended to alleviate a global food crisis.\n\nThe announcement from Russias Defense Ministry came hours after it accused Ukraine of launching an attack on ships from the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea that it said were participating in the grain initiative, which was organized around specific shipping lanes in the Black Sea.\n\nRussia at first said that it had repulsed the attack by Ukrainian drones, but later backtracked and said at least one minesweeper had sustained damage.\n\nGiven the attack, the statement from the Defense Ministry said, \"Russia suspends its participation in the implementation of the agreements on the export of agricultural products from Ukraine.\"\n\nThe suspension will be \"for an indefinite period,\" according to Russias Foreign Ministry. It said in a statement that Russia stood ready to sell its own grain to world markets as a replacement for Ukrainian grain.\n\nThe agreement, known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative, was signed in July and ended a five-month Russian blockade of Ukraines ports. Brokered with Russia and Ukraine by the United Nations and Turkey, the deal was set to expire on Nov. 19. In recent weeks, its future had appeared uncertain.\n\nThe United Nations said Saturday that it was in touch with the Russian authorities regarding the reports that Russia was suspending participation.\n\n\"It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people,\" Stphane Dujarric, the spokesman for Antnio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said.\n\nUkraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government had warned that Russia would try to upend the deal.\n\n\"Now Moscow uses a false pretext to block the grain corridor which ensures food security for millions of people,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"I call on all states to demand Russia to stop its hunger games and recommit to its obligations.\"\n\nAlthough the grain deals primary goal was to end Russias blockade on Ukrainian exports, which had been contributing to a global food crisis, it also allowed for more shipments of Russian grain and fertilizer. As part of the deal, the United States and the European Union gave assurances that banks and companies involved in trading Russian grain and fertilizer would be exempt from sanctions.\n\nIn recent weeks Russia had suggested it might refuse to extend the agreement if Moscows demands over its food and fertilizer exports were not met.\n\nUnder the pact, Ukrainian pilots guide ships through Ukrainian minefields around the ports, and are then given safe passage by the Russian Navy to Turkey, where teams with representatives from all the parties inspect them before they head to delivery ports. Returning ships are also inspected for arms.\n\nCassandra Vinograd contributed reporting.",

Otherwise, we will have to reassess our collaboration with them, which is hardly in anyones interests,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe US and European Union say they have evidence that Iran supplied Russia with Shahed-136s, low-cost drones that explode on landing. Washington says any arms transfer was in contravention of UN Security Council Resolution 2231 which is part of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a now moribund deal to curb Irans nuclear activities and prevent the country from developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nTehran denies supplying the drones to Russia and earlier this week said it was ready for \"dialogue and negotiation with Ukraine to clear these allegations\" after Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine should break diplomatic ties with Tehran.\n\nOn Wednesday, Irans UN envoy, Amir Saeid Iravani, rejected the \"unfounded and unsubstantiated claims\" on the drone transfers and said that Tehran, which has abstained in votes on the war, wanted a \"peaceful resolution\" of the conflict, which began when Russia sent its troops into Ukraine on February 24.\n\nIravani said Ukraines invitation \"lacks any legal foundation\" and called on Guterres \"to prevent any misuse\" of the resolution and UN officials on issues related to the Ukraine war.\n\n\"Iran is of the firm belief that none of its arms exports, including UAVs, to any country\" violate resolution 2231, he added.\n\nEU prepares sanctions\n\nUnder the 2015 resolution, a conventional arms embargo on Iran was in place until October 2020.\n\nBut Ukraine and its Western allies argue that the resolution still includes restrictions on missiles and related technologies until October 2023, and can encompass the export and purchase of advanced military systems such as drones.\n\nFrench UN Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said Guterres has a \"clear mandate twice a year to report on all these things and to make technical assessments, so I think the UN secretariat will have to go and will go\".\n\nGuterres reports twice a year to the Security Council traditionally in June and December on the implementation of the 2015 resolution. Any assessment of the drones in Ukraine would probably be included in that report.\n\n\"As a matter of policy, we are always ready to examine any information and analyse any information brought to us by Member States,\" UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Wednesday.\n\nToday I raised in the Security Council the UKs serious concerns over Iranian drones being used to target civilians in Ukraine by Russia. The Iranians have denied this but it doesnt stand up to scrutiny. Council members have asked the UN to investigate. 1/2 Ambassador James Kariuki (@JamesKariuki_UN) October 19, 2022\n\nThe EU is expected to approve sanctions over the drones ahead of a summit that starts on Thursday in Brussels.\n\nA list seen by the AFP news agency showed the 27-nation grouping would take action against three senior military officials, including General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, the chief of staff of Irans armed forces, as well as drone maker Shahed Aviation Industries, an aerospace company linked to the countrys Revolutionary Guards.\n\nNabila Massrali, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, said the bloc had \"gathered our own evidence\" and would prepare \"a clear, swift and firm EU response\".",

                "cc_text": "Illustration: Liu Rui/GT\n\nA letter signed by 30 members of the progressive caucus of the US House of Representatives and sent to the White House on Monday, which urged President Joe Biden to engage in direct talks with Russia to end the Ukraine crisis, was rescinded only one day later.The letter triggered fierce pushback from many Democrats as well as Republicans who believe it's an unrealistic idea. The letter called on Biden to pair the economic and military support the US is providing Ukraine with a \"proactive diplomatic push, redoubling efforts to seek a realistic framework for a cease-fire,\" which involves direct talks with Russia. According to the Washington Post, this was the first time prominent members of Biden's own party have pushed him to change his approach to Ukraine.Solving the Russia-Ukraine conflict via diplomatic means is a pragmatic suggestion. As the conflict has dragged on for more than eight months, prices of food, energy, and other bulk commodities have soared, leading to inflation worldwide. Inflation in the US has even reached a 40-year high. It is a thorny domestic issue Biden needs to tackle urgently, over which his Republican rivals attacked him harshly. Therefore, easing the situation in Ukraine via diplomacy instead of cruel military means to avoid US resources from being further consumed fits the interests of the Democratic Party and the US.Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times that at the beginning, the progressives inside the Democratic Party had not voiced strong opposition to Biden's support of Ukraine, either out of the so-called shared values, hostility toward Russia or obligations to allies. But as the conflict continues, the negative impact on the US economy has driven them to suggest Biden change course.Xu Liang, an associate professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing International Studies University, believes that the letter signed by some progressives reflects the fact that inside the US, there are people who do not want the US to be dragged in the mud of war for long. However, the criticism the letter had drawn and its retraction show that in the US, \"political correctness\" dominates.For the US, it is politically correct to support Ukraine and sanction Russia. There is no room for compromise. Since the Ukraine crisis, the US has kept instigating other countries to strengthen sanctions on Russia and expand military assistance to Ukraine, which shows the US has no will to play a constructive role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As a result, voices that called for a proactive diplomatic push were quashed right away. Obviously, within the Democratic Party or the US, there is no such thing as \"democracy\" - they all speak in one voice.The midterm elections are looming large. As people hold a negative view of Biden himself and the performance of his Democratic Party, the mainstream Democrats may think that the release of the letter does no good to the Democratic Party because it goes against the political correctness of the US on the Ukraine issue.\"Mainstream Democrats place the interests of elections higher than the significance of solving the Ukraine crisis properly,\" said Zhang Tengjun, deputy director of the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies at the China Institute of International Studies.As long as anti-Russia and pro-Ukraine political correctness continues to dominate US policy, and as long as US politicians continue to regard political naivety as political freedom, the US will not have a pragmatic mindset for diplomatic negotiations. When the voices of pragmatism and rationality are suppressed, it is impossible for the US to play a fair role in the Russia-Ukraine issue and assume the responsibilities it should have.This means that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will be more difficult to solve, because it is not just one that Russia has with Ukraine, but a concentrated outbreak of geopolitical conflicts that Russia has with the US-led NATO. The US, the initiator of the conflict, must show some sincerity and push forward some substantive measures. If it does not seize the opportunity, it is difficult to predict how the crisis will play out in the future.",

Our command has gone f***ing nuts.\n\nHumanitarian\n\nOccupiers order Kherson citizens to leave the city and make it to Dnipros left bank, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing occupying \"authorities\" of Kherson Oblast on Telegram. \"On 22 October, the occupying \"authorities\" in Kherson Oblast ordered the residents to leave the city and cross to the left bank of the Dnipro river due to the \"tense situation at the front\". The \"authorities\" also ordered people to take documents, money, valuables and clothes with them.\n\nOn 20 October, Ukrainian media reported that the Russian occupation forces were transferring their military equipment and personnel from the right bank of the Dnipro river to its left bank in Kherson Oblast, following recent successes of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in liberating the Oblast.\"\n\nThe energy facility was completely destroyed in Lutsk. Ukrainska Pravda reports. \"Ihor Polishchuk, the Mayor of Lutsk, reports that a Russian missile strike on 22 October resulted in the complete destruction of one of the citys energy facilities. Damage to the affected energy facility was critical. In fact, it has been destroyed. It is currently impossible to restore it.\n\nAccording to the preliminary information from the Mayor, the attack involved the use of three X-101 cruise missiles.\"\n\nRussian missile strikes leave an estimated 1.5 million Ukrainians without electricity, Ukrainska Pravda reports. \"Russian missile attacks on energy facilities have left 1,451,603 Ukrainians across the country without electricity.\n\nAccording to information from the Presidents Office, as of 14:00 on 22 October, Russian missile attacks have cut off: 672,000 people in Khmelnytskyi Oblast; 188,400 in Mykolaiv Oblast; 102,000 in Volyn Oblast; 242,000 in Cherkasy Oblast; 174,790 in Rivne Oblast; 61,913 in Kirovohrad Oblast; and 10,500 in Odesa Oblast.\"\n\nTodays damage to energy facilities may exceed the consequences of attacks on 10-11 October, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing the press service of Ukrenergo. \"Today, 22 October, the Ruscists carried out another missile attack on the energy facilities of the main power networks in the western oblasts of Ukraine. The extent of the damage is comparable to or may exceed the consequences of the attack on 10-12 October.\"\n\nRussia wants to provoke refugees to flee from Ukraine by striking energy facilities Office of President of Ukraine, Ukrainska Pravda reports. \"Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, believes that Russia is carrying out massive attacks on critical infrastructure in order to cause an influx of refugees from Ukraine into Europe.\n\nAccording to him, whether Vladimir Putin, the president of the aggressor country, [can] implement his plan today depends entirely on the European leaders. Podoliak believes that the only way to stop the humanitarian catastrophe is to provide Ukraine with air defence equipment as soon as possible.\"\n\nEnvironmental\n\nThe occupiers have begun discharging water from the Kakhovka Reservoir, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing Kommersant media outlet. \"The (Kakhovka ed.) Hydroelectric Power Plant continues to work, even though three units are out of order. It has not stopped working for a single day since 24 February. Last week, the water discharge intensified to decrease the quantity of water gushing down the stream in the worst-case scenario. [Volodymyr Leontiev, the Russian-appointed puppet leader/governor of the city of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region], added that \"the level of water down the stream has risen; all the stop logs are open; preventative water discharge is being conducted now.\n\nOn 20 October Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, reported that Russians mined the dam and units of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant and are planning to commit a terrorist attack under the Ukrainian flag.\n\nOn 21 October Ukraine called upon the UN, EU and other organisations to send an international monitoring mission to the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant in the occupied part of Kherson Oblast.\"\n\nPresident Zelenskyy: World should act more actively to end Russias nuclear blackmail, Ukrinform reports, citing President Volodymyr Zelensky in an interview with Canadas CTV and CBC. \"We are dealing with terrorists. We do not have to constantly respond to any of their conditions. We must show that the world is stronger than any terrorist, and you, the terrorists, will fulfill our conditions, so that we can sit down at the negotiating table with you,\" Zelensky said.\n\nIn his words, Russia resorted to nuclear blackmail after seizing Zaporizhzhia NPP and created an uncertain security situation in order to impose its own conditions. According to the President of Ukraine, 500 armed Russian militants are staying within the plant with explosives.\n\nAt the same time, Zelensky thanked the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the condemnation of Russias policy regarding Zaporizhzhia NPP and urged the world to take more decisive steps required to liberate the plant. The demilitarization of the plant not just words but the withdrawal of all militants from the plant such serious conditions should be imposed by the IAEA, Europe and the world. Otherwise, the IAEA should break off relations with Russia, Zelensky stressed.\n\nAccording to Zelensky, Russia should clearly understand the effects of its actions, as no one is allowed to blackmail the world.\"\n\nLegal\n\nRussian drone and missile strikes are illegal and may constitute war crimes Norwegian statement in the Security Council meeting on Ukraine, 21 October 2022. \"Norway will continue to stand with Ukraine, and the Ukrainian people, against this Russian aggression, which is a gross violation of international law, and the UN Charter. We are alarmed by the escalation, and brutality, of the recent Russian attacks on civilians, and civilian infrastructure, with missiles and drones. These attacks which seem deliberate have killed civilians and hit several power facilities across Ukraine. Damage to energy infrastructure brings great humanitarian harm, and will certainly cause illness and death when the cold winter arrives.\n\nThe attacks have no military purpose. The aim seems to be to terrorize the population. They are illegal and may constitute war crimes. Those responsible must be personally held to account.\n\nRussias devastating attacks against cities and urban areas over the last eight months have killed and maimed civilians, including children, and led to massive displacement both internally and across borders. We are concerned about sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking, that women and unaccompanied children are particularly exposed to. We must facilitate their return, and the delivery of essential services, and mitigate the long-term effects that Russias war has imposed on them.\n\nThe Independent International Commission of Inquiry has concluded that violations of human rights and international humanitarian law amounting to war crimes have been committed by Russian armed forces. The killing of civilians, mass graves, rape, and other forms of sexual violence, forced disappearances and torture have all been recorded.\n\nAlong with reports of deportations to Russia, and adjustments to procedures to allow Russians to adopt Ukrainian children without the consent of their parents. And more. The victims deserve justice. Survivors must be cared for. And those responsible must be held accountable. But to stop these grotesque violations in the first place, this war must come to an end. Russia must withdraw its troops from within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine and stop the war.\"\n\n430 children were killed, 820 children injured, 8,709 deported by foe forces, and 243 reported missing the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine reports as of October 23. 2,663 educational establishments are damaged as a result of shelling and bombings, and 326 of them are destroyed fully. 41,644 crimes of aggression and war crimes and 18,339 crimes against national security were registered.\n\nSupport\n\nFollowing Russias missile strike, Ukraines Foreign Minister calls on the West not to delay air defence systems supply to Ukraine, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing European Pravda. \"Saturday in Ukraine starts with a barrage of Russian missiles aimed at critical civilian infrastructure. We have intercepted some of them, others hit targets. Air defence saves lives. There should not be a minute of delay in the capital deciding on air defence systems for Ukraine. Kuleba wrote on Twitter.\n\nGermany hands over another batch of weapons, ammo, and winter clothing to Ukraines Army, Ukrinform reports, citing the federal government press service. \"Germany has delivered to Ukraine a new batch of weapons, packages of winter clothing and equipment for the military.\n\nAs follows from the updated list of deliveries, five more armoured recovery vehicles were transferred (the same number as delivered in the previous consignment); 7 heavy and medium bridge systems; 167,000 cartridges for firearms, 100 tents (the total number now reaches 200); 183 generators (previously 12 were transferred); 116,000 winter jackets; 80,000 winter pants; and 240,000 winter hats.\"\n\nA $1 trillion question for the West: How to rebuild shattered Ukraine, the Editorial Board at The Washington Post asks. \"Beyond Ukraines stunning recent battlefield successes, eight months of war have rendered the country a physical, financial and economic basket case. Millions of refugees have fled, the countrys gross domestic product has shrunk by about one-third, and the government, its budget depleted by the war, runs monthly deficits of $4 billion or more mainly financed by Western grants, a lifeline for teachers, retirees living on pensions and millions of others.\n\nEven if Russia were to withdraw now, Ukraine would remain enfeebled for years. Before Russian President Vladimir Putin rained missiles on Ukrainian power plants and other facilities this month, the cost of repairing damage to the countrys critical infrastructure had already been estimated at nearly $200 billion, according to a study by the Kyiv School of Economics. And that is just a fraction of the overall wreckage wrought by Moscows indiscriminate attacks.\n\nRebuilding the country, among Europes biggest by population and area, will be a generational undertaking. \"Its not every day that you rebuild a whole country,\" said Vlad Rashkovan, a former deputy governor of the Ukrainian central bank who now represents the country on the International Monetary Funds executive board. One question the $1 trillion question, in the estimate of some economists is who will pay for it. The United States and Europe, along with international banks and development institutions, must take leading and shared roles.\n\nFor Ukraine to succeed, it must also be reformed and broadly reinvented as a viable candidate for admission into the European Union, which can wield the leverage to effect those reforms. That means the reconstruction of Ukraine will depend on more than cash and concrete, although heroic quantities of both are needed. Ultimately its fate will turn on a transformation of mind-set and governance in a nation notorious for oligarchs and endemic corruption. Even before the shooting stops, the country must launch a durable, ironclad, transparent project to transform ministries, markets, courts, businesses and institutions, raising them to Western democratic and free-market standards.\n\nEasier said than done, of course. Prewar Ukraine aspired to join the E.U., in the sense that a C student aspires to admission to the Ivy League. Transparency International ranks it as Europes third-most-corrupt country, behind only Russia and Azerbaijan. When a top advocate for reform in Ukraine was asked recently how corruption was faring in the country after months of war, he responded dryly: \"The good thing is, theres no money.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, rightly lionized as an inspirational wartime leader, was ineffective at best during his first three years in office in rolling back graft, the very promise that got him elected in 2019. His second prime minister, dismissed in 2020, said Mr. Zelensky fired him because the governments own anti-corruption efforts were threatening wealthy power brokers close to the president. Hundreds of millions of dollars in government funds and foreign aid have been siphoned off in recent years by oligarchs, who have used Ukraines several thousand state-run companies as ATMs, with the governments connivance.\n\nReforms need to start even as rebuilding and humanitarian efforts accelerate in shattered towns and cities from which Russian troops have withdrawn. They are key not only to launch Ukraine on what will be a long path toward E.U. membership an exceptionally rigorous process but also to signal to Western governments and multilateral institutions that their aid dollars will not be leached away by oligarchs and kleptocrats.\n\nUkraine has begun an impressive reconstruction planning effort thousands of officials and multiple working groups are hammering out blueprints to rebuild housing, roads, transportation hubs, factories, communications towers, and water and sewer systems. Its own full-court press should be matched by an intensified international focus on Ukraines long-range needs, even as the West rushes funds, arms and materiel to help fight an existential war against Russia.\n\nWestern leaders cannot drag their feet on determining who will oversee and coordinate the hundreds of billions of dollars that will be required over time. Among the plausible candidates are the Group of Seven, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the E.U. itself. Someone needs to be in charge, and soon. A good place to start on that question is Berlin, where an international conference on Ukraines reconstruction is set for Tuesday.\n\nAt the same time, Ukraine should be on notice that Western aid will be heavily conditioned, and that the tsunami of grants and soft loans that officials in Kyiv hope for is likely to ramp up gradually. That will disappoint some Ukrainians. But it is realistic, given the political and economic pressures in donor countries grappling with energy inflation, nationalism and war fatigue. Pledges for Afghanistans reconstruction have so far fallen short of the United Nations target amount. The E.U.s own promise earlier this year of 9 billion euros to close Ukraines monthly budget gaps has so far yielded just a fraction of that amount.\n\nUkrainians understandably want the rebuilding project to tap Russian assets that have been frozen by the West, including $300 billion in Russian Central Bank deposits. No question: Moscow should pay war reparations. But legal, financial and political obstacles stand in the way. Even if some Russian assets can be seized or extracted through negotiations to help Ukraine rebuild, that will likely take years.\n\nOther moves can and should happen faster. The West is already sending large aid packages to address immediate problems beyond the battlefields. In August, the State Department announced an $89 million grant to help disable hundreds of thousands of Russian mines scattered over an area bigger than Virginia and Maryland combined.\n\nAnother critical measure is to establish an insurance fund, backed by international financial institutions, to promote private-sector investment. Without that, businesses are unlikely to be able to insure projects they are considering in Ukraine. Corporations typically move faster than international donors; they are key to building wealth in a postwar Ukraine.\n\nIt is a vital Western interest not only to defeat a blood-soaked invasion but also to get Ukraine right in the long run. Since the Soviet collapse three decades ago set Ukraine free as an independent country, its anemic institutions, deep-rooted corruption and misgovernance were promoted and exploited by Moscow. The result has been a cataclysm.\n\nThe best course now is to rearrange Europes security architecture by ensuring that Ukraine is reborn as a vibrant, wholly modern country a bulwark against an eastern neighbor that might remain brutish for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nNew Developments\n\nZelenskyy announces when negotiations with Russia can resume, Ukrainska Pravda reports. \"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy states that Ukraine can open negotiations with Russia after the return of all its territories within the borders of 1991, but there will be no return of relations with Russia that existed before the war.\" Verkhovna Rada introduced a draft resolution recognising Belarus temporarily occupied country, Ukrainska Pravda reports. A draft resolution recognising Belarus as a temporarily occupied country has been introduced in Verkhovna Rada, Ukraines Parliament. The resolution is introduced as \"an appeal to the international community to recognise the territory of Belarus as temporarily occupied by Russia; revocation of the international legal recognition of the government of [Aleksandr] Lukashenko; termination of Belarusian participation in international organisations (UN, IMF, etc.); and as an appeal to synchronise sanctions against Russia with those against Belarus as an occupied territory, and removing any opportunities for Russia to circumvent sanctions via Belarus or to use Belarus as an offshore zone.\" Kuleba calls for Russia to be stripped of its seat in UN Security Council due to war crimes in Ukraine, Ukrinform reports. \"Ukraines Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for Russia to be stripped of its permanent seat in the UN Security Council due to numerous war crimes committed by Russian troops in Ukraine during the full-scale aggression against the country.\" Russian Permanent Representative to UN leaves UN Security Council meeting before Ukrainian Representatives speech, Ukrainska Pravda reports. \"Vasilii Nebenzia, the Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations, has announced that he left the UN Security Council meeting in order not to hear a speech by Sergiy Kyslytsya, the Permanent Representative of Ukraine.\" The US is open to diplomacy to achieve peace in Ukraine, but Russia does not want this Blinken, Ukrinform reports. \"Blinken said the US would consider all means to advance diplomacy, however, Russia does not show any signs of a desire to participate in meaningful diplomacy. Blinken said that when it comes to ending the war through diplomatic efforts, it depends entirely on whether the Russian Federation reaches a point where it is really interested in ending the aggression it has unleashed.\" Ukraine should decide on when to start talks on ending war Macron, Ukrinform reports. \"French President Emmanuel Macron believes that the return to negotiations should be part of the way to end Russias war against Ukraine. Ukraine must determine whether such a moment has come. \"We are not fighting in Ukraine. We support Ukraine. We impose sanctions against Russia. But we are not taking part in this war, so it is not in our power to stop it, as we are not a party to this conflict,\" the French president said.\"\n\nAssessment\n\nOn the war.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War has made the following assessment as of 22 October 2022:\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Oskil River-Kreminna Line) Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted counteroffensive operations in the direction of Kreminna and Svatove on October 22 . The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces repelled a Ukrainian assault in the direction of Kuzymivka (13km northwest of Svatove) near the N26 highway that leads into Svatove from the north. The Russian MoD also claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian attacks northwest of Kreminna near Novovodiane (24km northwest of Kreminna) and Chervonopopivka (6km northwest of Kreminna). A Russian milblogger also claimed that Russian forces repelled a Ukrainian assault west of Kreminna near Terny. A Russian Combat Reserve BARS-13 affiliated Telegram channel claimed that BARS-13 artillery units repelled an attempted Ukrainian advance north of Kreminna. The BARS-13 affiliated Telegram channel also claimed that Ukrainian maneuvers near Terny and Novosadove (17km northwest of Kreminna) suggested that Russian forces lack continuous defensive positions along the R66 Svatove-Kreminna highway, despite previous claims from Russian sources to the contrary. ISW cannot independently verify Russian claims [.]. Russian forces conducted unsuccessful limited counterattacks to regain lost territory in Kharkiv, Luhansk, and Donetsk Oblasts on October 22. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian ground attack near Ternova (20km southwest of Vovchansk) in Kharkiv Oblast. The Ukrainian General Staff also reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian attacks in the vicinity of Bilohorivka (15km west of Sievierodonetsk) and Zolotarivka (14km southwest of Sievierodonetsk) in Luhansk Oblast and in the direction of Lyman in Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces continued routine indirect fire along the Oskil River-Kreminna line on October 22. Southern Ukraine: (Kherson Oblast) Russian forces continued to withdraw from northwestern Kherson Oblast on October 22. Russian forces are likely conducting a fighting withdrawal and are continuing to strike Ukrainian positions in northwestern Kherson Oblast. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces shelled settlements near the Inhulets River and northwest of Kherson City and conducted an airstrike against Novovoskresenske (about 66km northeast of Nova Kakhovka). Ukraines Southern Operational Command stated that Russian helicopters attacked Ukrainian forces in Nova Kamianka and Tryfonivka (about 55km northeast of Nova Kakhovka) three times. Ukraines Southern Operational Command added that Russian forces also attacked Novovoskresenske and settlements in its vicinity with Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones and S-300 systems attacking ground targets. The Russian MoD claimed that Russian forces repelled several Ukrainian attacks in northwestern Kherson Oblast. Russian proxy officials claimed that Russian paratroopers (VDV units) are continuing to operate in northern Kherson Oblast. Geolocated footage showed Russian artillery targeting Ukrainian forces in Bezimenne, about 15km southeast of Inhulets River. Ukraines air defenses shot down 16 Iranian-made kamikaze drones in Mykolaiv Oblast last night Ukrainian forces continued to target Russian logistics, military equipment, and positions in central Kherson Oblast. The Ukrainian General Staff confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck a Russian repair base in Nova Kakhovka on October 20, and geolocated footage published on October 22 showed the aftermath of the Ukrainian strike on a Russian surface-to-air missile system in the city. Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces shelled the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant. Ukraines Southern Operational Command reported that Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian attack helicopter and destroyed three ammunition depots in the Beryslav Raion. Russian forces continued to withdraw from western Kherson Oblast while preparing to conduct delaying actions that will likely be only partially effective. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces have completely abandoned their positions in Charivne and Chkalove (both approximately 33km northwest of Nova Kakhovka), and Russian officers and medics have reportedly evacuated from Beryslav. The Ukrainian General Staff added that Russian forces are also removing patients from the Kakhovka Hospital on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, likely to free up hospital beds for Russian military casualties that may result from the withdrawal across the river. The Ukrainian General Staff noted that some Russian elements are preparing Kherson City for urban combat, while other servicemembers continue to flee the city via the ferry operating in the vicinity of the Antonivsky Bridge. The UK Ministry of Defense reported on October 22 that Russian forces completed the construction of a barge bridge alongside the damaged bridge and forecasted that the barge bridge would become a critical crossing point for Russian forces as Ukrainian forces advance toward Kherson City. A large part of the Kherson City population has also reportedly left the city. Russian forces are preparing a series of delaying actions with mixed efficacy. Russian forces are likely preparing to destroy the dam at the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant (KHPP), flooding and widening the Dnipro River to delay any Ukrainian advances. Russian occupation authorities in Nova Kakhovka are likely attempting to moderate the resultant flooding; Nova Kakhovka Occupation head Vladimir Leontyev said on October 22 that Russian authorities are lowering the volume of water from the reservoir behind the dam to minimize damage in case the KHPP is destroyed but stayed true to the false narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, would blow the dam. Ukraine has no interest destroying the dam and every interest in preserving the energy supply in newly-liberated parts of Kherson Oblast. Ukraines Southern Operational Command reiterated that Russian military leadership has moved their officer corps across the river but left newly-mobilized men on the western bank of the Dnipro River as a detachment left in contact. Using such inexperienced forces to conduct a delaying action could prompt a Russian rout if Ukrainian forces choose to press the attack, as ISW previously assessed. One Russian milblogger noted that the situation in Kherson Oblast is dire for Russian troops, noting that it is \"virtually impossible\" for Russia to evacuate troops from the first lines of defense and that only two questions remain: how to withdraw the final front line of forces, and how to explain the withdrawal to the Russian population. Russian occupation authorities ordered the forcible \"evacuation\" of civilians from Kherson City on October 22. [] The occupation administration encouraged evacuees to bring clothes, valuables, and documents, indicating that they do not expect a rapid Russian or civilian return to western Kherson. Russian forces expect to leave the city and are therefore likely trying to depopulate parts of the oblast that Ukraine will recapture, damaging the long-term social and economic viability of southern Ukraine. Russian authorities are likely also making initial efforts to evacuate at least those civilians who are willing to cooperate with Russian occupation authorities and would otherwise be in the path of flooding resulting from the blown Kakhovka dam. [] Ongoing Russian strikes on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure are extraordinarily unlikely to erode the Ukrainian will to fight but will increasingly pose an economic and humanitarian challenge for Ukraine as temperatures drop. Russian shelling and strikes have damaged approximately 30% of Ukraines energy infrastructure in recent weeks, prompting rolling blackouts across the country, not just along the front lines. Blackouts combined with cold winter weather and damaged civilian buildings will likely increase the suffering of Ukraines civilian population this winter. Russias campaign of targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure is creating a humanitarian tragedy without meaningfully altering the battlefield situation, and Russian excuses for such strikes are wearing increasingly thin. The Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Vasily Nevenzya, claimed on October 22 that Russian drones are only hitting civilian targets in Ukraine because Ukrainian defensive fire requires the drones to change course, a bizarre admission of culpability. Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin continues to create rifts within the Russian government by publicizing the so-called \"Wagner line\" of fortifications in northeastern Ukraine, which appears misaligned with Kremlin-led narratives on the course of the war. Prigozhin and Wagner-affiliated Telegram channels announced that Russian regional officials paused the extension of the Wagner Line fortifications that run behind the line of contact in Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts and into Russias Belgorod Oblast. Prigozhin accused the Russian bureaucracywhich he characterized as \"bureaucrat-enemies\"of \"directly opposing the interests of the population\" and not protecting the Russian population by supporting the construction of the line. The Russian nationalist community has repeatedly accused the Kremlin of failing to defend the Belgorod Oblast border, and Prigozhin may be attempting to amplify their demands. The Kremlin is likely attempting to maintain its limited framing of the war, which will likely continue to upset the nationalist community that is seemingly concerned by the lack of defenses around Belgorod Oblast. Prigozhin and Wagner-affiliated Telegram channels previously indicated that there is an ongoing schism within the Kremlins power circles between officials that are hesitant to continue the war due to personal interest and those in favor of Russian total victory. Russian maps show that Prigozhins proposed Wagner Line extension would defend the border between Belgorod Oblast and Ukraines Sumy, Kharkiv, and Luhansk oblasts, but notably would not cover northern Luhansk Oblast up to the line of contact, placing it at odds with Kremlin promises to defend all of Luhansk. Other maps show that the Luhansk-Donetsk Wagner Line segment will largely only defend the territory of Luhansk Oblast that Russian proxy forces controlled prior to their February 24 full-scale invasion. The line covers some newly occupied settlements like Lysychansk, Zolote, and Popasna, but excludes Kreminna and Sievierodonetsk. Prigozhin and Wagner commanders are likely preparing to defend the positions they think they can realistically hold, not the present extent of Russian lines or all of the territory the Kremlin claims to have annexed, and are likely not confident in Russias ability to defend settlements north of Lysychansk such as Kreminna and Svatove. Key Takeaways Russian forces continued large-scale strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure.

Russia is massing thousands of troops in its western neighbor Belarus, raising fears that Moscow might plan to open a new front in its war against Ukraine, but officials from Kyiv to Washington are casting doubt on whether the military buildup represents a serious threat.\n\nWith Russia already struggling to defend territory in eastern and southern Ukraine, it can ill afford to pick a new fight on a third front in the north on the border with Belarus, officials and analysts say. We have to be cautious, but I doubt that Russians are at this moment capable of opening another front line against Ukraine, at least not a successful front, Latvias defense minister, Artis Pabriks, said on Friday. He said some 10,000 of the Kremlins forces were gathering in Belarus, possibly to try to disrupt the flow of Western weapons into Ukraine from Poland. []\n\nBritains Defense Ministry said in an intelligence assessment on Friday that the flurry of military activity in Belarus is \"likely an attempt to demonstrate Russian-BelaRussian solidarity and to convince Ukraine to divert forces to guard the northern border.\" Some Western officials say the Russian move is probably just a feint or a training mission, while others say it could be preparation for an attack, though likely not a very effective one, but their views come with a heavy dose of uncertainty.\n\nThose who think a new offensive is possible say it probably would be aimed not at Kyiv, Ukraines capital which the Russians failed to capture with a thrust out of Belarus at the outset of the invasion but far to the west, near the border with Poland, to disrupt Western shipments of arms and other supplies. But plunging into western Ukraine near the Polish border would be very, very risky for both Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the strongman leader of Belarus, and for the Kremlin because the region is the traditional heartland of Ukrainian nationalism, said Valery Kavaleuski, a former Belarusian diplomat and now a foreign affairs adviser to his countrys exiled opposition movement. It would be suicidal, a very bad idea but who knows what they might do, he added. []\n\nMr. Lukashenko, Belaruss increasingly Moscow-dependent president, announced last week that his country and Russia were forming a new joint military force, with 70,000 Belarusian troops and up to 15,000 Russians, putatively to guard against NATO. A Ukrainian general, Oleksiy Gromov, said on Thursday that the threat of a possible invasion from Belarus was growing. But Ukraines military intelligence agency does not see an immediate danger, a spokesman, Vadym Skibitsky, said in an interview on Friday.\n\nSeveral thousand newly mobilized Russian soldiers are deployed in Belarus at training sites, Mr. Skibitsky said, but they are not accompanied by the tanks, artillery or fuel trucks and other logistical support they would need to invade and face Ukraines battle-hardened troops. We see these elements now moving into Belarus, but we do not see the movement of equipment, he said.\n\nMr. Putin used the territory of Belarus, his closest military and political ally, as a staging ground for his February invasion and his forces have since launched missiles and drones into Ukraine from there. But Mr. Lukashenko has resisted Russian pressure to get more involved in the war.\n\nBut Michael R. Carpenter, the United States ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna, cautioned in a telephone interview that Russia and Belarus had both shrouded the purpose of their new joint force in an opaque fog that makes it \"hard to say whether there is some sort of operation being prepared from Belarus or this is just an attempt to pin down Ukrainian troops.\" []\n\nAir Force Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, also played down the likelihood of a Russian invasion from Belarus: \"We dont currently have any indications of a potential imminent military action on that front,\" he told a briefing Thursday. Many Western and Ukrainian officials believe that Belaruss primary role will be to help Russia train new draftees, many of whom have no military experience, before sending them to Ukraine. Russias own training facilities have been stretched to the breaking point since Mr. Putin last month ordered the conscription of as many as 300,000 troops to prop up his faltering war effort. Some draftees have been dispatched to the front lines with minimal preparation; some have already been killed.\n\nMr. Lukashenko has held power for 28 years thanks to support from Moscow, while fending off a yearslong push by Mr. Putin to, in effect, merge their countries, ending Belaruss independence. Mr. Pabriks, the Latvian defense minister, said Mr. Lukashenko was \"moving things to the left, moving things to the right, pretending that he is doing stuff but obviously the Russian tide is against him. Lukashenko is trying to maneuver in an increasingly narrow space. Obviously Putin is trying to bring Belarus more into his war against Ukraine, but Lukashenko understands that would be the end of his time if he did this, Mr. Pabriks said.\n\nMr. Lukashenko, he added, had become so dependent on Russia for his own political survival that Russia controls his country and we should assume probably that there will be more involvement from the Belarusian side against the Ukrainians, but I very much doubt that this would bring large benefits to Russia. [] On Friday, Ukraines armed forces said in a statement that if the country were attacked it would \"respond as fiercely as we respond to all occupiers.\" It also said that, in the event that troops from Belarus were ordered to attack, they should disobey their leaders and surrender.\"\n\n[/box]\n\nConsequences and what to do?\n\nThousands protest in Germany demanding solidarity in energy relief, Reuters reports. \"Tens of thousands of protesters in six German cities gathered on Saturday to demand a more just distribution of government funds to deal with rising energy prices and living costs and a faster transition away from fossil fuels. Protesters marched in Berlin, Duesseldorf, Hannover, Stuttgart, Dresden and Frankfurt-am-Main, holding signs bearing slogans on everything from lowering inflation to switching off nuclear power and more energy price subsidies for the poor.\n\nGermanys parliament on Friday approved the governments 200 billion euro ($195 billion) rescue package which aims to protect companies and households from the impact of soaring energy prices. The package includes a one-off payment to cover one monthly gas bill for households and small and medium-sized businesses and a mechanism to limit prices from March.\n\nIt will also finance a cap electricity prices for households and industry retroactively from March for spot prices and from December for future prices, with additional funding drawn from electricity companies profits. German inflation in September hit its highest level in more than a quarter of a century at 10.9%, driven up by higher energy costs.\"\n\nHans Petter Midttuns assessment\n\nTodays assessment will be published as a separate article. A teaser:\n\n\"Despite the huge flaws uncovered and recent Ukrainian triumphs, it is important not to underestimate Russias ability to reconstitute its military potential. Especially considering both Ukrainian and Western challenges. As Russian defeat cannot be taken for granted we must respond to Russian resolve: We must dig in and increase our joint efforts.\n\nIn 2023 Russia will be waging war with an increasingly depleted, demotivated and unqualified Armed Forces.\n\nIts retreat from the Western Kherson and the upcoming winter might, however, give it time to prepare for the next phase of the war. Dnipro will temporarily stop further Ukrainian advances in the south. The winter will not only reduce the efficiency of UAVs recognisance and satellite-based intelligence means but also turn the ground into mud making further ground assaults increasingly difficult. The winter is expected to be milder than normal, possibly denying Ukraine the opportunity to manoeuvre quickly over frozen ground.\n\nIt will give Russia time to train the newly mobilised forces, having possibly mobilised more than one million soldiers. While the fundamental flaws will remain, it will explore its core \"advantage\": its fundamental disregard for human life.\"",

                "cc_text": "Despite concerns about the effects of the current energy crisis, global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion are expected to grow by just under 1% this year, only a small fraction of their increase last year, as a strong expansion of renewables and electric vehicles prevents a much sharper rise.\n\nNew IEA analysis of the latest data from around the world shows that these CO2 emissions are on course to increase by close to 300 million tonnes in 2022 to 33.8 billion tonnes a far smaller rise than their jump of nearly 2 billion tonnes in 2021, which resulted from the rapid global recovery from the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic. This years increase is driven by power generation and by the aviation sector, as air travel rebounds from pandemic lows.\n\nThe rise in global CO2 emissions this year would be much larger more than tripling to reach close to 1 billion tonnes were it not for the major deployments of renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles (EVs) around the world. Even though the energy crisis sparked by Russias invasion of Ukraine has propped up global coal demand in 2022 by making natural gas far more expensive, the relatively small increase in coal emissions has been considerably outweighed by the expansion of renewables. Global energy trends have also been affected this year by the impacts of Russias war on the world economy, which have significantly dampened expectations for economic growth, notably in Europe.\n\nThe combined result is that the CO2 intensity of the worlds energy supply is set to improve slightly in 2022, resuming a years-long trend of consistent improvement that was disrupted last year by the emissions-intensive economic recovery from the Covid crisis. This years expected improvement contrasts with what happened following the 2008 global financial crisis, which saw strong deteriorations in the CO2 intensity of energy supply for several years after the initial economic shock.\n\n\"The global energy crisis triggered by Russias invasion of Ukraine has prompted a scramble by many countries to use other energy sources to replace the natural gas supplies that Russia has withheld from the market. The encouraging news is that solar and wind are filling much of the gap, with the uptick in coal appearing to be relatively small and temporary,\" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. \"This means that CO2 emissions are growing far less quickly this year than some people feared and that policy actions by governments are driving real structural changes in the energy economy. Those changes are set to accelerate thanks to the major clean energy policy plans that have advanced around the world in recent months.\"\n\nSolar PV and wind are leading an increase in global renewable electricity generation in 2022 of more than 700 terawatt-hours (TWh), the largest annual rise on record. Without this increase, global CO2 emissions would be more than 600 million tonnes higher this year. The rapid deployment of solar and wind is on course to account for two-thirds of the growth in renewable power generation. Despite the challenging situation that hydropower has faced in several regions due to droughts this year, global hydropower output is up year-on-year, contributing over one-fifth of the expected growth in renewable power.\n\nWhile electricity generation from both wind and solar PV is growing far more than any other source in 2022, coal is expected to post the next largest increase as some countries revert to coal use in response to soaring natural gas prices. In total, global CO2 emissions from coal-fired power generation are set to grow by more than 200 million tonnes, or 2%, this year, led by increases in Asia.\n\nThe European Unions CO2 emissions are on course to decline this year despite an increase in coal emissions. The rise in European coal use is expected to be temporary, with a strong pipeline of new renewable projects forecast to add around 50 gigawatts of capacity in 2023. These additions would generate more electricity than the expected increase in coal-fired power generation in the EU in 2022. In China, CO2 emissions are set to remain broadly flat this year, reflecting the mixture of different forces at work, including weaker economic growth, the impacts of drought on hydropower, and major deployments of solar and wind.\n\nAs well as the challenges for hydropower in some regions, the worlds low-emissions electricity supply has suffered a setback from a series of nuclear power plant outages, which are set to reduce global nuclear power production by over 80 TWh. This has largely been due to more than half of Frances fleet of nuclear reactors being offline for part of the year. The drop in nuclear power generation globally has contributed to an increased use of coal and oil for electricity generation. The worlds use of natural gas is expected to decline following Russias invasion of Ukraine, resulting in a decrease in CO2 emissions of around 40 million tonnes in 2022.\n\nDemand for oil is set to grow more than for any other fossil fuel in 2022, with oil-related CO2 emissions up by around 180 million tonnes. This has been driven largely by the transport sector as travel restrictions have been lifted and pre-pandemic commuting and travel patterns have resumed. Aviation is expected to contribute around three-quarters of the rise in emissions from oil use, notably due to increases in international air travel. However, the aviation sectors emissions are still only around 80% of their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nUncertainty in global natural gas markets will continue to shape many key energy trends for the rest of this year and in 2023. However, promising signs of lasting structural changes to the CO2 intensity of global energy are evident in 2022 and they are set to be reinforced by major increases in government support for clean energy investment, notably in the US Inflation Reduction Act, as well as in decarbonisation plans such as the European Unions Fit for 55 package and Japans Green Transformation (GX) plan, and in ambitious clean energy targets in China and India.\n\nThe effects of recent policies on energy security and global emissions trends will be explored in depth by the IEAs World Energy Outlook 2022, which will be released on 27 October.",

                "cc_text": "Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, originally an informal group of the leading emerging economies of the early 2000s, have since experienced very different growth paths. Their significance in the global economy at a time of considerable geopolitical uncertainty remains an open question.\n\nOver the past two decades, there has been an astonishing restructuring of global economic power. This has been driven primarily by the rise of China and, to a lesser extent, the BRICS countries more broadly which, in addition to the East Asian giant, encompass Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa.\n\nAs this group has become increasingly formalised and institutionalised hosting regular summits and establishing collective bodies many observers have worried that its growing influence might be accompanied by the normalisation of authoritarian forms of state capitalism, and even the unravelling of the liberal order.\n\nOthers have taken a more sanguine view, arguing that Eastern forms of state-led development appear superior in many ways to Anglo-American economic and political structures, and this is reconcilable with and, indeed, depends on an open global economy.\n\nEither way, the concerns of many Western liberals have resurfaced following Russias invasion of Ukraine. Recent news that other mostly non-democratic states Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey (and Argentina) have either applied to join the BRICS, or are considering doing so, is also cause for concern among Western governments.\n\nWhat are the BRICS and why do they matter?\n\nAt one level, the idea of the BRICS is confected. The former Goldman Sachs economist (and now crossbench peer) Jim ONeill coined the term BRIC in the early 2000s to describe the four fast-growing countries that, at the turn of the millennium, seemed most likely to begin catching up with the West (ONeill, 2001).\n\nLooking back, this notion appears quite problematic (Bishop, 2012). Brazils growth slowed dramatically around 2014 as it struggled with early de-industrialisation (Muzaka, 2017).\n\nRussia was an erstwhile superpower. To describe it as rising therefore was and remains questionable, particularly as its industrially atrophied post-communist economy has stayed small in global terms. Even today, as the country mounts a major military offensive, its GDP is still barely half that of the UK despite a population almost three times the size and the largest, most resource-rich territory on the planet.\n\nIndias growth has been impressive, but its relative share of global GDP has actually shrunk and its economy is now around one-fifth the size of Chinas. One author describes the pair comparatively as the slouching tiger and roaring dragon (Kennedy, 2016).\n\nSouth Africa is arguably not a rising power at all in global terms and was primarily tagged on to the grouping later for reasons of regional representativeness.\n\nIn fact, the story of the BRICS is largely about Chinas staggering rise. Its development has been so sustained over such a long period of time that it has genuinely reshaped the distribution of global economic power (Bishop, 2016).\n\nFigure 1: GDP by BRICS country (2000-21), in current dollars\n\nAs the chart shows, Chinas GDP is more than double that of the other four BRICS combined: almost $18 trillion compared with Brazil ($1.6 trillion), Russia ($1.8 trillion), India ($3.2 trillion) and South Africa ($400 billion). For comparative purposes, GDP in the United States is $23 trillion but Chinas economy is arguably the largest in the world in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.\n\nIn the early research on the subject, there were fierce debates over which countries should and should not be included in the next generation of emerging powers (Cooper et al, 2006).\n\nSome questioned whether the MINT countries Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey might be next (ONeill, 2013). Others stressed that a focus on large middle-income countries ignores the many small ones such as New Zealand, Norway, Qatar and Singapore that have achieved high levels of income and development while exercising power in unconventional ways (see Long, 2022).\n\nThere have always been question marks over which countries, exactly, should comprise the rising or emerging powers, and what criteria best capture this. What does it even mean to rise or emerge, and how do we know when a state has finally risen or emerged?\n\nBy the same token, as some rise, other must decline relatively: do we even have a language to describe developmental decline or undevelopment in supposedly developed countries (Bishop and Payne, 2019)?\n\nThese questions aside, the BRICS have, over time, become more deeply institutionalised. Since 2009, the countries have held annual summits with an increasingly widened agenda.\n\nThe establishment of the New Development Bank (NDB) in 2014 with $50 billion of start-up capital was another milestone. So too was the simultaneous creation of the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), a liquidity mechanism that provides support for members facing short-term balance of payments squeezes or currency instability (see Cooper, 2017).\n\nIt is in this context, at a time when much of the world is still reeling from the pandemic, that this institutionalisation process may be intensifying.\n\nWhy are countries seeking new forms of cooperation?\n\nThe motivations of prospective BRICS members are complex. Take Saudi Arabia: it is already an exceptionally wealthy country, it has a close security relationship with the United States and it can mobilise substantial sovereign wealth for investment in pursuit of economic expansion (see Trudelle, 2022). But domestic political modernisation remains slow, and the economy is highly dependent on energy and threatened in the long run by global decarbonisation.\n\nA degree of diplomatic isolation has also followed the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Like all authoritarian states, Saudi Arabia has to search for sources of domestic and international legitimacy. Increasingly dense trade links with China will be critical to this endeavour, by simultaneously diversifying the economy and sources of international support (Martin, 2021).\n\nSimilar stories apply to Egypt, Iran and Turkey, where the respective regimes have all experienced volatile economies, political conflict and diplomatic isolation in recent history. The Arab Spring of a decade ago still casts a very long shadow over the Middle East as a whole, leaving rulers feeling insecure and repression enduring (Josua and Edel, 2021).\n\nAnother potential BRICS member, Argentina, is a little different. Growth has fluctuated constantly since the dramatic financial crisis of 2001 (Stiglitz and Weisbrot, 2022). Periods of expansion and policy experimentation have occurred in tandem with buoyant export revenues during the late 2000s and early 2010s (Grugel and Riggirozzi, 2012).\n\nBut inflation has remained high and the currency has tanked. One US dollar bought one peso prior to 2001; a decade later it bought eight to ten pesos; and yet a decade further on, it now buys 148. Debt is also growing again. It exploded from around 40% of GDP to 160% in the aftermath of the 2001 crisis, declined again to around 40% alongside the commodity boom by 2014, and then rose once more to over 100% of GDP by the time the pandemic arrived in 2020.\n\nArgentina has long required new sources of capital and international institutional power. Indeed, its demand for inclusion in the Group of 20 (G20) during the global financial crisis of 2007-09 in part reflected resentment at Brazils membership and relatively higher perceived status as an emerging power.\n\nBut what is in it for the BRICS as an organisation? New members, in theory, imply new economic resources that can be mobilised and greater strength in numbers. The expansion of the group also provides greater legitimacy and reinforces the sense that the club is worth joining an effect that could become self-perpetuating.\n\nAt the same time, while these potential new members are certainly regionally significant, they are not the largest, most powerful, economically dynamic or diplomatically influential of countries that could theoretically join (certainly compared with the MINT countries). Furthermore, the BRICS would no longer really comprise mainly the rising powers in a global sense with Argentina, Iran and Saudi Arabia joining.\n\nConsequently, the broader issue is that the BRICS as an organisation still lacks deeper institutionalisation. Beyond the establishment of the NDB, it is difficult to see what the group has done other than meet annually (ONeill, 2021).\n\nThis problem is compounded by the fact that economic growth trajectories have been so uneven, and the group lacks clear unifying ideological principles or a shared vision for managing the global order.\n\nExpanding the membership, then, is at least partly about gaining renewed impetus in a context where the BRICS remain beset by divergent interests, development trajectories, relative levels of geo-economic significance and ability to exercise substantial influence over the international system.\n\nIn all of these areas, Chinas power resources far outstrip those of the other members, while as an aspirant hegemon, it also depends most on and has additional responsibility for maintaining a calm, stable and open global economy (Beeson and Zeng, 2019).\n\nBut the level of openness that China adopts, or the extent of its accommodation to liberal, Western mores, depends to a significant degree on the policy area under discussion (Hameiri and Zeng, 2019; Weinhardt and ten Brink, 2020).\n\nHow could the expansion of the BRICS affect the global economy?\n\nThe worry, from a Western perspective, relates to the fact that with the partial exception of South Africa (Reddy, 2022) the BRICS have become, to differing degrees, more nationalist and authoritarian over the past decade.\n\nXi Jinping has cemented his dominance in China. Brazil under Jair Bolsonaro who will shortly face a presidential election run-off against Lula da Silva and India under Narendra Modi have both experienced a starkly populist turn (de Souza, 2020; Sinha, 2021). Vladimir Putins Russia has become a pariah state that poses numerous thorny geopolitical questions extending well beyond the immediate Ukraine crisis (Burns, 2019; dEramo, 2022). In all four, minorities are persecuted and civil rights restricted.\n\nConsequently, some European and US policy-makers worry that the BRICS may become less an economic club of rising powers seeking to influence global growth and development, and more a political one defined by their authoritarian nationalism.\n\nYet both the BRICS and the West share much in common. Economically, people the world over have long been disenchanted with market-led globalisation. The United States and many European countries and even the European Union (EU) itself have marvelled at Chinas expansion and reassessed their own desperate need for new institutions and mechanisms to drive interventionist industrial policy to keep up (Lavery and Schmid, 2021; Hopewell, 2021).\n\nPolitically with continuing constitutional upheaval wrought by Brexit and the election of Donald Trump only the most obvious examples Western countries have also experienced declines in the quality of democracy. As European states elect (or come close to electing) nationalists like Georgia Meloni in Italy or Marine Le Pen in France, they appear more vulnerable to further democratic decay than at any other time in recent history.\n\nDiplomatically, the war in Ukraine appears to have drawn a stark dividing line between an Eastern-backed Russia and the West. But this only obscures the complicity of many of the latters banking institutions and political elites in fostering Putins regime, even as its excesses became progressively more evident (Bienkov, 2022).\n\nSo as the BRICS rise, they disrupt the global order in problematic ways that give incentives to the West to adopt illiberal mores (Hopewell, 2017). But the East also faces the countervailing pressure to become more liberal themselves, thereby reinforcing as well as reshaping that order (Bishop and Murray-Evans, 2020).\n\nThis is evident in the ambivalent way that China and India are torn between their self-identity as developing countries, with a purported mission to lead the Global South, and the unavoidable reality that their economic interests increasingly align with the Global North (Cooper, 2021).\n\nThe web of constraints that China and India face notably the tension inherent in preserving an uneasy BRICS unity while becoming responsible global diplomatic powers themselves was highlighted starkly in September 2022 when both made their displeasure at Russias quagmire in Ukraine public for the first time (Lau, 2022).\n\nWill globalisation endure?\n\nIt is difficult to envisage a decisive decoupling of West from East, or a definitive process of deglobalisation. The sheer volume of trade in goods and services, the flows of capital, data and people across borders to facilitate it, the extent of economic interdependence and the complexity of global value chain-based production, which relies on inputs sourced from around the world, all militate against it (Bishop and Payne, 2021a).\n\nWe will not see a decisive retreat behind national borders. Authoritarian autarky is not a viable or credible development strategy today. But at the same time, the pressures facing states from below mean that high levels of unmediated and destabilising economic openness also remain politically toxic.\n\nThe future of the global economy will plausibly remain globalised in general with globalisation itself changing shape while simultaneously becoming more national in certain respects.\n\nThis is not as contradictory as it sounds. Globalisation is a process driven substantially by states that are embedded within it. The two co-exist: they are not alternatives.\n\nWe require a recalibration of the nature of the relationship an attempt to find greater policy space for nations within a renewed overarching global framework of institutions, rules and norms.\n\nBetween the two, the regional level is crucial. Indeed, even if we are witnessing some degree of reshoring in light of Ukraine and wider upheavals in the global economy, many production networks are likely to reconstitute themselves regionally rather than nationally (Grey, 2019). Modern forms of production at the highest points of a value chain require economies of scale that are frequently continental in scope.\n\nThe key question is not if the global economy will evolve and change shape, but rather whether this occurs in a well-managed or increasingly fraught way. This will be determined by how the framework of global governance adapts to new realities.\n\nInternational bodies are unquestionably in desperate need of reform and revitalisation (Bishop and Payne, 2021b). But the system that they collectively comprise is not as dysfunctional as is often believed (Drezner, 2014).\n\nAll states require the public goods that they provide and, as Lord ONeill (2021) notes, the greatest disappointment with the performance of the BRICS is that they have not yet lived up to their promise in terms of sustaining the G20 on the next chapter of its development.\n\nOvercoming this will be necessary for the body to carry out its crucial role of steering the global economy in coming years and ensuring that tensions between West and East are mollified rather than magnified.\n\nWhere can I find out more?\n\nThe End of American World Order by Amitav Acharya (Polity Press, 2018).\n\nHandbook of BRICS and Emerging Economies edited by PB Anand, Shailaja Fennell and Flavio Comim (Oxford University Press, 2021).\n\nBRICS: A Very Short Introduction by Andrew Cooper (Oxford University Press, 2016).\n\nClash of Powers: US-China Rivalry in Global Trade Governance by Kristen Hopewell (Cambridge University Press, 2021).\n\nWho are experts on this question?\n\nGregory Chin, York University, Toronto, Canada\n\nTom Chodor, Monash University, Australia\n\nAndrew Cooper, University of Waterloo, Canada\n\nKristen Hopewell, University of British Columbia, Canada\n\nValbona Muzaka, Uppsala University, Sweden\n\nAmrita Narlikar, GIGA Hamburg, Germany\n\nAuthor: Matthew Bishop, University of Sheffield\n\nPhoto by William_Potter on iStock",

                "cc_text": "Ukraine war: Russians start leaving Ukraine's Kherson city\n\nBy Paul Kirby & Paul Adams BBC News\n\nRossiya 24\n\nRussian TV channels showed footage of people gathering to cross the Dnieper river\n\nTens of thousands of civilians and Russian-appointed officials are being moved out of Ukraine's southern Kherson region ahead of a Ukrainian offensive, says the Russia-installed local leader.\n\nVladimir Saldo said all Russian-appointed departments and ministries would cross the Dnieper river.\n\nSome 50-60,000 civilians would also leave in an \"organised, gradual displacement\", he said earlier.\n\nUkraine has called on residents to ignore the Russian move.\n\nThe head of Kherson's regional administration said Russia wanted to take civilians hostage and use them as human shields. The transfer or deportation of civilians by an occupying power from occupied territory is considered a war crime.\n\nIn a separate development, Russia's Vladimir Putin said he had signed a decree imposing martial law on four Ukrainian regions, including Kherson, which Moscow annexed last month in a move rejected as illegal by the international community.\n\nHe told Russia's Security Council that it would give regional leaders additional powers to maintain social order and safeguard important facilities.\n\nOn Tuesday night, residents in Kherson started receiving text messages, urging them to evacuate immediately to avoid shelling of residential areas by Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe messages said transport across the Dnipro River would be available from 07:00 on Wednesday.\n\n\"They are told to evacuate because the evil Ukrainians are going to shell the city,\" one resident told the BBC, asking to remain anonymous.\n\n\"People are panicking because of propaganda.\"\n\nRussian TV footage on Wednesday showed a number of people gathering near the west bank of the Dnieper. As they queued for boats, it was not clear how many were leaving.\n\nBut Ukrainian officials have questioned whether large numbers of people are actually being evacuated, suggesting that images of a crowd assembled by the river are largely for show.\n\nSerhiy Khlan, an aide to the ousted head of the Kherson region, suggested the \"deportations theatre\" could be acting as cover for a much bigger Russian move: a complete military evacuation from the west bank of the river.\n\n\"I foresee the withdrawal of troops,\" he said, adding that he expected Russian forces to attempt to destroy the city after leaving.\n\nRussia, he said, was planning to establish a new capital for the Kherson region at Henichesk, close to the Crimean Peninsula, adding that banks and offices related to the occupation of Kherson had already been evacuated.\n\nOne Kherson resident told the BBC's World Service that she was not going anywhere until Kherson was liberated by Ukrainian troops: \"People are not panicking, nobody wants to be evacuated.\"\n\nShe said that Russian soldiers were now worried how they could survive in the city. \"There are plenty of them here; they are dressed as civilians. We can see them - they are different to Kherson people. They walk in groups, their hair is cut short, they are dressed mainly in black.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have warned that this might represent the start of a forcible deportation to Russia.\n\nIn early September, the UN said there were already credible accusations of forced deportation of Ukrainian children from other Russian-occupied areas. Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzia, called the allegations \"unfounded\".\n\nReuters\n\nPresident Putin has also announced heightened security levels inside Russia\n\nAs part of the decree, President Putin announced three additional levels of heightened security inside Russia.\n\nThe highest level applies to Russia-annexed Crimea and other areas near the border with Ukraine, such as the regions of Belgorod, Kursk and Krasnodar.\n\nIn these areas, there will be more security, possible evacuation orders and some restrictions placed on travel.

Sputnik/Sergei Karpukhin, via Reuters\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin, in a speech seemingly aimed more at winning over political conservatives abroad than his own citizens, declared on Thursday that Russias battle was with \"Western elites,\" not with the West itself.\n\nMr. Putin, addressing an annual foreign policy conference outside Moscow, appeared intent on capitalizing on political divisions in the United States and its allies that have only heightened since they began showering Ukraine with military aid to fend off the Russian invasion.\n\nMany of the themes of the Russian leaders speech were familiar, but they took on particular resonance given the coming midterm elections in the United States and growing discontent in Europe over the costs of the war.\n\n\"There are at least two Wests,\" Mr. Putin said.\n\nOne, he said, is a West of \"traditional, mainly Christian values\" with which Russians feel kinship. But, he said, \"theres another West aggressive, cosmopolitan, neocolonial, acting as the weapon of the neoliberal elite,\" and trying to impose its \"pretty strange\" values on the rest of the world.\n\nMr. Putin, as he often does, portrayed Russia as threatened by the possible expansion of NATO and the values of its liberal democracies to include countries like Ukraine that were once part of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe denied that Moscow was preparing to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. \"We have no need to do this,\" he said. \"Theres no sense for us, neither political nor military.\"\n\nIt is Mr. Putin himself, however, who has raised that prospect, as have other senior Russian officials. And Kremlin assurances have proved unreliable. In the days before the war began, for example, Russia denied that it planned to invade Ukraine.\n\n\"This is a trick it shouldnt make anyone relax,\" said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political analyst, noting that Mr. Putin has blamed the West and its support for an independent Ukraine for every escalation in the war. \"His goal is to show that escalation is the product of Western policies.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, officials ridiculed Mr. Putins speech. Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, said the Russian president was accusing the West of what he has been doing himself, chiefly violating another countrys sovereignty.\n\n\"Any speech by Putin can be described in two words: for Freud,\" Mr. Podolyak posted on Twitter.",

Putin on Wednesday repeated Russias unsubstantiated warning that Ukraine was preparing to explode a so-called dirty bomb, as concerns rose in the West that the Kremlin was seeking a pretext to escalate its war in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Putin joined the chorus of senior Russian officials who have claimed in recent days without providing evidence that Ukraine planned to detonate a dirty bomb, which uses conventional explosives to spread radioactive material. It was the first time the Russian leader made the claim, which Western officials have dismissed, suggesting Moscow could use it as a pretext for launching its own attack.\n\nAt the same time, the Russian military conducted an annual exercise involving land, sea and air field tests of its missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.\n\nState television broadcast short clips of the launches as well as an excerpt from Mr. Putin receiving a briefing from Russias defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, saying that the tests had been successful.\n\nRussia informed the United States of the test beforehand as stipulated by disarmament treaties, U.S. officials have said. U.S. officials said that Russias annual strategic exercises started Wednesday morning and that they appeared routine, \"with all customary notifications in place.\"\n\nBut Mr. Putins claim, coupled with the military exercises, added to the concerns of a possible escalation of the war in Ukraine, a day after President Biden warned Mr. Putin that it would be \"an incredibly serious mistake\" to use a tactical nuclear weapon in the conflict.\n\nA dirty bomb is not a nuclear device, but Mr. Bidens warning reflected the increasingly urgent concern in Washington and among Western allies that Russia may be searching for a pretext to unleash a tactical nuclear weapon.\n\nImage A still image from a video released by the Russian Defense Ministry on Wednesday shows what it said was an intercontinental ballistic missile launched during exercises in Russia. Credit... Russian Defense Ministry, via Reuters\n\nOn Wednesday, in a video address to a conference of intelligence chiefs from heads of the security agencies from former Soviet states, Mr. Putin accused Washington of supplying Ukraine with \"heavy weapons\" and said that the risk of conflict was high in the region and around the world. Security should be heightened around key infrastructure sites, he said.\n\n\"It is also known about plans to use a so-called dirty bomb for provocation,\" a Kremlin summary of the message quoted Mr. Putin as saying.\n\nRussia has not made public any evidence to substantiate its dirty bomb accusation against Ukraine.\n\nAntony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, said Wednesday during a public talk at the Bloomberg News bureau in Washington that the United States continued to watch for any moves by Russia to escalate the war in Ukraine, including with nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We havent seen a reason to change our own nuclear posture,\" Mr. Blinken said. \"But its something were tracking very carefully, and weve also communicated directly and very clearly to the Russians, to President Putin, about the consequences\" that would follow from \"any use of a nuclear device.\"\n\nValeriya Safronova , Mujib Mashal , Edward Wong and Julian E.

                "cc_text": "Since Russia launched its unjustified and unprovoked all-out war against Ukraine in February 2022, the United States has worked with Allies and partners around the world to impose an unprecedented range of sanctions and export controls on Russia for its brutal aggression. Moreover, we will continue to impose costs on the Kremlin for as long as its war of aggression continues.\n\nSanctions and export controls are having significant and long-lasting consequences on Russias defense industrial base. Since February 2022, the United States and our partners and Allies have coordinated to use export controls and sanctions to restrict Russias access to advanced technology , which has degraded the Russian weapons industrys ability to produce and stockpile weapons to replace those that have been destroyed in the war.\n\nA few effects include:\n\nMajor supply shortages for Russian forces in Ukraine are forcing Russia to turn to less technologically advanced countries such as Iran and North Korea for supplies and equipment.\n\nand North Korea for supplies and equipment. Russia is struggling to import semiconductors and other key components. Export controls have forced Russia to cannibalize existing airline parts they can no longer access abroad.\n\nRussian hypersonic ballistic missile production has nearly ceased due to the lack of necessary semiconductors used in the manufacturing process.\n\nRussias military aviation program has been cut off from resupply provided by global aviation trade.\n\nRussian media reports that production of its next-generation airborne early warning and control military aircraft has stalled due to lack of foreign components, including semiconductors.\n\nMechanical plants, including those producing surface-to-air missiles, have been shut down due to shortages of foreign-origin components.\n\nRussia has reverted to Soviet-era defense stocks because our measures have interrupted Russian companies abilities to replenish domestic supply chains.\n\nExports on certain goods and services, including dollar-denominated banknotes, accounting, management consulting, quantum computing, and trust and corporate formation services to persons located in the Russian Federation are now prohibited.\n\nIn addition, since February 2022, the U.S. government has:\n\nDenied all [U.S.] exports, reexports to, and transfers of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations for military end uses or end users in the Russian Federation and Belarus.\n\nTargeted Russian and Belarusian military end users through their addition to the Department of Commerces Entity List, which has effectively cut off these end users from nearly all items subject to the Export Administration Regulations.\n\nDenied exports to, reexports to, and transfer within Russia and Belarus of items needed for oil refining. Also imposed additional license requirements to further limit the Russian oil sector by restricting the export, reexport and transfer of additional items needed for oil refining.\n\nTargeted items useful for Russias chemical and biological weapons production capabilities and other advanced manufacturing by imposing export controls.\n\nTargeted luxury goods to impose costs on certain Russian oligarchs who support the Russian government by imposing license requirements and denying licenses for the export and reexport of luxury goods for all end users within Russia.\n\nUsed new foreign direct product rules targeted at Russia to prevent exports of foreign-origin items produced with U.S. advanced technologies, tools, and software. This prevents these items being transferred to support Russias military capabilities.\n\nFormed a coalition of 37 countries that has amplified the impact of U.S. actions by applying substantially similar controls to those imposed by the United States. This robust global coalition reinforces U.S. efforts to isolate Russia from commodities, technologies, and software necessary for Putins war.\n\nFurthermore, sanctions (administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury) are having a significant impact on Russias ability to wage its unjust war against Ukraine. Specifically, sanctions implemented by the United States along with Allies and partners and allies have immobilized about $300 billion worth of Russian Central Bank assets, limiting the central banks ability to aid the war effort and mitigate sanctions impacts. Sanctioned Russian oligarchs and financial institutions have been forced to divest from long-held assets outside Russia. Moreover, sanctions have prompted banks in several countries to curtail ties with the Russian financial sector. Despite benefiting from high energy prices, the IMF still expects Russias economy will contract by over 3 percent this year. Lost investment, export controls, and constraints on Russias real economy will create a drag on Russias growth prospects for years to come. Significantly, U.S. sanctions and export controls have severed Russias access to key technologies and industrial inputs that erode its military capability. Since February 2022, the United States has issued approximately 1,500 new and 750 amended sanctions listings, including:\n\nState Corporation Rostec, the cornerstone of Russias defense-industrial base that includes more than 800 entities within the Russian military-industrial complex, such as Sukhoi, MiG, and Kalashnikov Concern.\n\nJoint Stock Company Mikron, Russias largest manufacturer and exporter of microelectronics.\n\nTactical Missiles Corporation JSC, a Russian state-owned enterprise that produces missiles used by the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine.\n\nIndividuals and entities located outside Russia who have sought to procure goods and technology for the Russian military-industrial complex and intelligence services\n\nRussias largest financial institutions and restricted dealings with banks representing 80 percent of Russian banking sector assets.\n\nRosoboronexport, which is Russias sole state-controlled intermediary agency for exporting and importing the entire range of military, defense, and dual-use products, technologies, and services.\n\nIssued guidance emphasizing the sanctions and export control risk to individuals and entities inside and outside Russia that provide material support for Russias sham referenda and purported annexation of the Kherson, Zaporizhzhya, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of Ukraine.\n\nFor further information, visit www.state.gov.",

Mr. Obamas strategy first issued in 2010 with Mr. Biden, who was the vice president at the time aimed to drastically diminish the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. defenses and focused much of its attention on keeping nuclear material out of the hands of terror groups. At the time, China and Russia were considered full partners in the effort to contain North Koreas nuclear arsenal and dissuade Iran from building nuclear weapons.\n\nThe new document is devoid of much specificity about how the Pentagon will shift its weapons and personnel to fit a new era of heightened superpower competition.\n\nIt describes a Russia armed with 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons and not bound by any treaty that limits the number, raising \"the possibility it would use these forces to try to win a war on its periphery or avoid defeat if it was in danger of losing a conventional war.\"\n\nThat is exactly what President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has threatened.\n\nThe document also describes an effort by China to expand its nuclear arsenal to about 1,000 strategic weapons in coming years. \"The current and growing salience of nuclear weapons in the strategies and forces of our competitors heightens the risks,\" it says.\n\nThreats from Iran, North Korea and terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State persist and new challenges, like global climate change, are emerging.

                "cc_text": "When Donald Trump assumed office, there were concerns that he might reverse some of the existing sanctions. Congress, which at the time was controlled by the Republicans, premptively restrained Trump, passing legislation that imposed further sanctions on Iran, North Korea, and Russia, and blocked unilateral lifting of certain penalties. Inside the Treasury Department, career staff members were confused about Trumps intentions toward Russia. One former Administration official told me that Trump did not seem interested in sanctioning Russia: \"He was focussed on Ukraine and Hunter Biden. He was focussed on Iran. He was focussed on, could he make a deal with China.\"\n\nMost of the former Treasury officials I spoke to agreed that the sanctions levied in that era were insufficient. Vladimir Ashurkov, a director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which is connected with the imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, echoed that conclusion. He said, \"If the sanctions we have now had been gradually introduced over the eight years that passed since the first hostilities started in Ukraine, in 2014,\" the current tragedy might have been avoided. \"I think they sort of encouraged Putins assertiveness over this eight-year period. By February, 2022, I think he didnt expect much retaliation.\"\n\nThe sanctions rolled out in those years also provided Putin with an opportunity he could later turn to his advantage. He and his fellow-lites in Russia learned how to accommodate and compensate for the worst penalties of the Western sanctions regime. The government built an enormous cushion of foreign reserves that could be drawn upon to prop up the value of the ruble. It also established front companies across the world that could, if needed, help with the procurement of crucial technology and components. As a result, the work of Wally Adeyemo and his colleagues this year wasnt just informed by a long line of previous sanctions programs. It was complicated by them.\n\nStanding behind public-facing officials such as Adeyemo are career civil servants, many with deep expertise, who have chosen to forgo more lucrative jobs in the private sector. One of them is Elizabeth Rosenberg, the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes. Earlier in her career, having completed graduate work in Near Eastern studies, shed covered the energy sector, national security, and sanctions as a trade journalist. But eleven years ago she decided that it was worth taking a pay cut to help create the sanctions shed been writing about.\n\nIn the autumn of 2021, when intelligence reports about Russias activities on the Ukrainian border made it plain that Putin was preparing for a large-scale invasion, she and other officials began to model steps that they might want to take, such as restricting Russian oil and gas imports, and the possible impacts those moves might have on the global economy. \"Sanctions involve costs. Theres no way around it,\" Rosenberg said. \"We are cutting ourselves off from the Russian market. We have a responsibility to make sure we are not doing more than we have to.\"\n\nA crucial aspect of the bureaucrats work is sifting through intelligence data and predicting collateral damagenot just humanitarian costs but those detrimental to U.S. economic interests. Assessments of that damage had to be considered well before any decisions were finalized.\n\n\"Word around school is youve been attributing Shakespeares works to Edward de Vere.\" Cartoon by Lars Kenseth Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nRosenberg worked closely with Andrea Gacki, the director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, who earlier in her career was at the Justice Department defending sanctions against targets who had sued the government. Through the fall and winter, the two officials consulted with their foreign counterparts about some of the knottier aspects of what they hoped to do.\n\nRosenberg and her colleagues travelled repeatedly to the U.K. and Europe. Sometimes her delegation would arrive and learn that the Europeans had budgeted only an hour or two for the meeting. \"I would say, No, were going to need a lot of time, \" Rosenberg recalled. \" We need coffee, we need snacks, we need room availability. \" Other times, they would be met with surprise when they asked that representatives of a given countrys justice department and intelligence services attend the discussion, as national-security issues were bound to come up. Hours were spent reviewing whether a particular country had the legal authority to freeze Russian assets, and, if it didnt, what it needed to do to establish such authority. After most meetings ended, Rosenberg and her team would rush to the American Embassy to send the results of the sessions to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department is the only such institution in the world that has its own intelligence agency, situated in the departments headquarters, on Pennsylvania Avenue. On the night of February 23rd, Rosenberg went through heavy metal doors, placed her phone in a lockbox, and began work on a classified memo to Yellen about proposed sanctions. In an adjoining room, intelligence analysts who are on duty twenty-four hours a day stood behind banks of blinking monitors. Around 10 p.m., one of the analysts announced that Russia had launched missiles at Ukrainian targets. The war had begun. An official in the room that night recalled how the teams sense of purpose intensified: \"I will not forget how that felt.\" Sweeping sanctions against Russia went into effect within hours.\n\nYellen told me, \"Im involved in some discussions with people at the finance-minister level. But when I hang up the phone I say, My senior staff will be in touch with yours, and I cast all of this on Andrea and Wally and Liz, and they do the heavy lifting. If this all works out, its because of them.\"\n\nSome of the plans activated in February were less comprehensive than they first appeared. Dozens of Russian officials hadnt been touched, and the initial SWIFT ban applied to only seven banks. But the sanctions designers wanted to leave room to ramp up the pressure should Putin not respond as they hoped.\n\nAs Rosenberg explained to me, designing and implementing sanctions, which are largely about economic forecasts and banking relationships, often feels like mechanical work. Typical days involve composing and editing memos and passing them up the chain. Humanitarian concerns may feel very far away. \"And then you have Bucha\"the site of a massacre of civilians by Russian forces this spring\"and you think, Oh, my God, this is why were doing it.\"\n\nNot all of what unfolded shortly after the invasion was anticipated, including a mass private-sector exodus from Russia. Within days, the anger of the Western public had moved dozens of companiesamong them Apple, Netflix, ExxonMobil, and Shellto announce that they were withdrawing from the country. Before long roughly a thousand more businesses joined them and, in Yellens account, \"multiplied the impact\" of sanctions.\n\nSingh thought that the pullout would have a lasting effect. \"Once a McDonalds leaves, it doesnt come back, especially those that had physical infrastructure that they just abandoned in Russia,\" he said. \"That was big.\"\n\nFrom the Treasury officials perspective, more penalties are not always better; heedlessly adding names to sanctions lists may have destabilizing consequences. In 2018, for instance, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the aluminum magnate and oligarch Oleg Deripaska and his companies in response to Russias invasion of Crimea and other activities. The announcement jolted the global aluminum market, prompting a price spike.\n\nThe sanctions or seizures of foreign assetsfor instance, the impounding this March by European officials of gaudy yachts linked to Rosneft, the state-controlled oil conglomerate, and to Alexey Mordashov, reportedly the richest man in Russiaare preceded by careful study and legal review. Before an individual or a company appears on a sanctions list, a multidisciplinary team at OFAC, often working with other government agencies, analyzes the potential consequences and tries to minimize unintended results.\n\nPutin countered the sanctions with strategies to create demand for rubles and drive up their value. He required that most Russian oil and gas purchases be paid in rubles, and the Russian Central Bank restricted the ability of the countrys citizens to exchange their money for foreign notes. By the end of June, the price of the ruble had rebounded. A month later, the Russian military had made slow but solid gains. Among its achievements was bombing the strategically important port of Odesa, which disrupted plans to release grain stores there that were badly needed in other parts of the world.",

Moments later comes the punch-boom of a deadly explosion.\n\nSmall, propeller-driven drones were first used last month by Russia in its ongoing war on Ukraine. But this week they have taken to the forefront, with dozens deployed daily to dive-bomb Kyiv, Dnipro and Mykolaiv, targeting Ukraines power infrastructure and causing blackouts across the country. At least eight people have been killed in the strikes, Ukrainian authorities say.\n\nThough their markings are in Russian and Moscow refers to them as the Geran-2, Pentagon officials, Ukrainians and observers say the weapons are Iranian-made Shahed-136s, nimble, so-called kamikaze drones (because they destroy themselves in the attack) that can travel thousands of miles before slamming into a target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIranian-made Shahed-136 drones can travel thousands of miles before slamming into a target. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThey came as part of a package comprising thousands of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, that Moscow imported from Tehran earlier this year to replenish its own rapidly vanishing stock of long-range precision missiles. And Thursday, the White House said the U.S. had evidence that a small number of Iranian troops were \"directly engaged on the ground\" in Russian-occupied Crimea to help launch the drones against Ukraine.\n\nThe Iranian drones \"are killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in Ukraine,\" said White House National Security Council coordinator John F. Kirby in a news briefing.\n\nRussia and Iran repeatedly deny such accusations. Tehran says it supports a peaceful resolution to the eight-month conflict and has called on Ukraine to provide evidence of the drones deployment.\n\n\"We have defense cooperation with Russia, but sending weapons and drones against Ukraine is not our policy,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in a phone conversation Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet at the same time, Western condemnation has drawn boasts from Irans military leaders such as Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, who said in a speech Tuesday that Irans drones have become so effective that \"today we have reached a point that 22 world countries are demanding to purchase unmanned aircraft from Iran.\"\n\nA drone approaches its target in Kyiv on Monday. (Yasuyoshi Chiba / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA day later, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also appeared to reference the drones, saying they were \"feats\" that \"bring honor to our country.\"\n\n\"When images of Iranian drones were published a few years ago, they would say theyre photoshopped. Now they say Iranian drones are dangerous, why do you sell them or give them to so-and-so?\" Khamenei said, according to a report from the state-owned Islamic Republic News Agency.\n\nIranian drones have been used for years in deadly attacks in Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates often with little response. But their appearance in Ukraines skies and the growing diplomatic storm that has caused highlight how the Russian invasion continues to force governments to contend with a Cold War-style calculus that accepts increasingly less overlap between the West and Russia.\n\nSaudi Arabia ran afoul of that equation earlier this month when it pushed oil production cuts at an OPEC+ meeting, infuriating the U.S., which said that the move signaled Riyadh had sided with Moscow and that it would now have to review its longstanding relationship with its Middle East ally.\n\nDrone sales have also prompted geopolitical recalculations.\n\nFirefighters respond after a Russian attack in Kyiv on Tuesday.

In response, officials in Kyiv downgraded relations with Tehran, stripping the Iranian ambassador of his accreditation and reducing diplomatic personnel at the embassy.\n\nThis weeks attacks pushed Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to propose a full severing of diplomatic ties with Iran.\n\nLeaders in Tehran would \"bear the most severe responsibility\" if they continue arms sales, Kyiv said, while inviting United Nations Secretary-General Antnio Guterres to dispatch inspectors and examine the wreckage of the more than 220 drones it claims to have destroyed thus far. The arms transfers, the U.S and Ukraine say, violate U.N. sanctions against Iran and Security Council Resolution 2231, which is related to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, with Tehran to limit its nuclear program.\n\nThe proposal, publicly supported by several U.N. Security Council members after the bodys closed-door meeting Wednesday, infuriated Moscow, whose Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said afterward that the Guterres team should \"not go beyond their technical mandate.\"\n\n\"Iran is of the firm belief that none of its arms exports, including UAVs, to any country\" violate resolution 2231, Irans U.N. envoy, Amir Saeid Iravani, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nA woman arranges flowers Wednesday outside a Kyiv house where a couple were killed in a Russian drone strike two days earlier. (Ed Ram / Getty Images)\n\nThe threat of additional sanctions on what is already one of the worlds most heavily sanctioned nations comes at a difficult time for Iran, rocked by weeks of protests after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of the so-called morality police.\n\nThose demonstrations have become an expression of wider grievances, including what many view as the governments intransigence in negotiations that could provide sanctions relief. Meanwhile, polls show the Iranian public doesnt view Russia favorably and believes the invasion of Ukraine is illegitimate.\n\nIts unlikely Iran would accept punishment in the name of supporting Moscow. And before the drone sales, trade between the two countries was $4 billion, hardly worth the financial hit from more sanctions.\n\nYet its a calculation Tehran appears willing to make, said Ali Vaez, who directs the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, even at the expense of completely killing off the nuclear deal.\n\n\"The view there is: Why should they abandon Russia at the time of its need, when even if the JCPOA is restored, theyre completely disillusioned about its effectiveness and the durability of sanctions relief that it offers?\" Vaez said. \"The strategic priority, for Iran, of preventing Russias failure in the Ukraine conflict is bigger than the restoration of the JCPOA.\"\n\nAnother Middle East power facing a balancing act with sales of UAVs in the conflict is Turkey. Its Bayraktar TB2 drones a medium-sized aircraft that can launch missiles have in years past faced off against Russian armor and Russia-aligned fighters in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh. Now in Ukraine they hunt Russian troops, with Kyiv deploying the dozens of TB2s it purchased to such powerful effect that Ukrainians dedicated a song to the drones battlefield prowess.\n\nAt the same time, Russia is a vital economic trading partner: It provides almost half of Turkeys natural gas and almost three-quarters of its wheat. Some 4.7 million Russian travelers visit Turkey every year.\n\nDiplomatically, Turkey has hedged: It condemned the invasion but nevertheless refused to levy sanctions and continues to welcome Russian oligarchs and other visitors. It also worked on a deal that allowed grain shipments to leave Ukrainian ports despite a Russian sea blockade.\n\nThough Russia complained to Turkey over the Bayraktar TB2 sales, Ankara said Kyiv had purchased the drones in a private capacity and did not constitute an agreement between the two governments. For now, Moscow appears to have been mollified: Baykar, the company that produces the TB2s, continues to sell them to Ukraine even as Ankara says it can play the role of intermediary between Moscow and the West.\n\nThe ripple effects of the presumptive Iranian drone attacks have also hit Israel, a top U.S. ally with strong links to Russia.\n\nRoughly 15% of Israels population (some 1.3 million people) are Russian-speaking immigrants with more Russian emigres arriving by the month because of the Ukraine war, according to Israeli government statistics.\n\nIsrael also works with Moscow to coordinate military maneuvers in Syria, where Russia has bolstered forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad since 2019 while turning a blind eye to Israeli strikes over Syrian territory on what it says are targets affiliated with Iran, Israels regional nemesis.\n\nAnd the Israelis have previously exported UAV tech and components to Moscow, including two surveillance drones deployed by the Russian army, the Zastava and Forpost, licensed copies of Israeli-built platforms, according to a report from Conflict Armament Research.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Israel didnt join in the U.S. and European Union economic sanctions, but it did dispatch humanitarian aid including helmets and bulletproof vests for rescue teams to Ukraine.\n\nFearing Russian umbrage, Israel has thus far refrained from providing Kyiv with military assistance, despite repeated entreaties. But with its arch-nemesis now embroiled in the conflict, its position appears increasingly untenable.\n\nThis week, an Israeli lawmaker demanded the government change its stance. That appeared to elicit a response from former Russian president and top Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev, who warned Monday that arming Ukraine would be \"a very reckless step\" that \"would destroy government relations between our countries.\"\n\nA day later, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba reiterated a long-standing request for Israel to \"urgently provide antiaircraft systems and to start high-quality cooperation on obtaining appropriate technologies for Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Iran is a red line for Israel, and after Iran has directly, in fact, become complicit in the crime of aggression against Ukraine, I think anyone in Israel who still has any hesitation about whether or not to help Ukraine, he must dispel these hesitations,\" Kuleba said.\n\nBut Israel refused again.\n\n\"Israel will not deliver weapon systems to Ukraine due to a variety of operational considerations,\" Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said during a meeting with EU ambassadors in Tel Aviv, adding that Israel would continue to support Ukraine \"within our limitations.\"\n\nThat, however, is not enough, Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk said.\n\n\"You cant win the war with air defense alert systems. We asked for defensive weapons, and they have all our requests and no reply,\" he said in a CNN interview Wednesday.\n\n\"Its like when youre going to the market and youre asking someone for the bread, and instead of the bread they give you the spoon.\"",

                "cc_text": "In mid-October 2022, in the eighth month of the war, Russian forces conducted the most intensive air attacks against Ukraine, with the energy infrastructure as the key target. Earlier this year, I participated in assessing such risks and preparing recommendations for the Ukrainian government on how to withstand air attacks. Now Ukraine is facing these attacks. Most data are unavailable or classified, which makes sense during a war, but some key conclusions can be drawn based on information publicly available.\n\nWhy Has Russia Started Attacking the Power System Now?\n\nEven before Russia unleashed its full-scale war against Ukraine on February 24, when the high risk of the invasion was clear, some analysts were concerned about possible massive attacks on the energy infrastructure and the likely outcomes. The concern was reasonable, insofar as electrical systems have been a favorite target of air attacks since the 1930s. But prior to February 24, many thought there would not be intensive strikes on energy facilities, based on the assumption that the Kremlin would want regime change in Ukraine and make the country accountable to Moscow. In that case Russia would not need to destroy the industries of the country it expected to control in the future, especially since the Russians planned to win in only a few weeks.\n\nThis assumption was partly valid. The only part of the energy infrastructure that sustained major damage during the first stages of the war was the fuel supply: key fuel depots and the only big refinery were destroyed by missiles during the first two months. But fuel supplies are crucial for logistics, and so play a vital role in wartime. In addition, Ukraines nuclear facilities experienced intensive and unexpected attacks.\n\nIt is very likely, then, that when Russian troops faced problems advancing in Ukraine and had to retreat after a successful counteroffensive by the Ukrainian army in Kharkiv and the South, the Kremlin decided to attack the power system. Besides creating immediate economic hardship and logistical problems, attacks on the power system are a powerful way to apply psychological pressure to citizens. Moreover, Ukraine had to pull air defense systems from the front lines to protect its power infrastructure across a greater territory. At this point, Ukraine lacks sufficient air defense systems, and Russia now has an advantage in pursuing air attacks after buying Iranian Shahed-136 \"kamikaze\" drones, which are more like single-use missiles.\n\nThe Scale of Russia's Attacks on the Power Infrastructure\n\nIn September, Russian missiles attacked power-generating facilities and substations, which caused interruptions of electricity supplies in Kharkiv oblast and in the cities of neighboring regions. Informally, Russian president Vladimir Putin admitted responsibility for these attacks on critical infrastructure and threatened to up the intensity of the attacks.\n\nOn October 10, Russia carried out the most massive missile and drone attack to date on Ukraine. Besides civil infrastructure, the key target was the energy grid, including electricity-generating and transmission infrastructure across the country. Heavy attacks on energy facilities were repeated the next day, with activity continuing over the next two weeks at a somewhat reduced level. Critical facilities in Kyiv, Dnipro, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kirovograd, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Lviv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnitsya, Zaporizhzhia, Zhytomyrliterally across the whole countrywere attacked by missiles on October 1011.\n\nThe attacks of October 1011 immediately affected the power system. Electricity-producing and distributing capacity was critically reduced, which meant demand could not be met. As a result, Ukraine had to suspend electricity exports to neighboring European states for an indefinite period, and some Ukrainian cities had to introduce rolling blackouts. Ninety percent of the city of Lviv was without power for many hours. By the end of the day on October 11, however, the electricity supply that sustained these attacks had been completely restored.\n\nOctober 1718 saw a new wave of attack, this time primarily with drones and fewer missiles. Less damage was incurred than during the previous weeks attacks, but it was still serious. Some cities, such as Zhytomyr, experienced power cut-offs. After these attacks, the power supply and the condition of the power system remained under Ukrainian control. But it is obvious that this second round of attacks was planned by the Russian army with the participation of Russian energy engineers.\n\nThe Status of the Power System\n\nBecause of the war, Ukraine had already lost a considerable part of its power capacity even before the October events. Total power-generating capabilities amounted to 56 GW before the war. Some 9 GW was produced by conventional large power plants that are now located in occupied territories, plus 6 GW by the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russian forces and was recently put into a cold shutdown state. Some facilities are no longer operating because they are located close to the line of hostilities, and some were damaged or destroyed by air attacks. Ninety percent of wind and 30 percent of solar power stations were destroyed or are located in occupied territories.\n\nBut the war has also led to a 3035 percent reduction in power demand. Before the October attacks, Ukraine appeared capable of getting through the winter safely, and perhaps even able to export electricity during some months if no new damage occurred. But in addition to power-generating facilities, the power transmission infrastructure also plays a critical role. The infrastructure connects power stations and consumers across the country and is crucial for Ukraines electricity exports and imports. And now this infrastructure is under attack.\n\nUkraines power system was designed to provide a reliable power supply in any event, which means it has extra capacity and reserve lines to supply the power. It is likely that the massive attacks of October 1011 represented Russias effort to shut down the power system entirely. But the power system demonstrated its reliability, and energy workers exhibited professionalism and dedication.\n\nThe Prospects\n\nNo matter how technically reliable any power system is, none is designed to withstand repeated massive air attacks. And repairing the system needs more time than the frequency of the most recent air attacks permits, and many spare parts. The proper operation of any technical system, including a national power system, requires a critical number of elements working properly. And frequent air attacks, by breaking up these elements, are undermining normal reliable operations.\n\nThere are just a few ways to help protect the power supply in Ukraine: (1) provide Ukraine with the necessary air defense weapons, (2) provide Ukraine with aid in the form of spare parts and equipment to repair damaged facilities, and (3) put pressure on Russia. All else will be handled by Ukrainian energy companies and the army.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those solely of the author and do not reflect the views of the Kennan Institute.",

                "cc_text": "Escalation is a cornerstone of Russian President Vladimir Putins strategy in his war against Ukraine, especially as Ukrainian counter-offensives have steadily rolled back Russian gains. As his setbacks mount, its important to address some key questions: How can Ukraine and its partners prevent further escalation to the nuclear level while denying Russia a chance to seize victory from the jaws of defeat. And if such escalation occurs, how should the West respond?\n\nAfter the initial attack on Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities, Russian escalation has occurred in several phases in response to its losses on the battlefield. These include the artillery assault in the Donbas, Russias mobilization, illegal annexations and martial law in four oblasts, probable sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, and massive recent attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure.\n\nIn each case, Russian escalation was aimed at gaining battlefield advantage and breaking Ukraines will. It has not succeeded in either purpose. Nevertheless, Putin will undoubtedly escalate again in the face of failure to achieve his shrinking war aims and to stave off strategic defeat. Ignoring his threats to escalate further, including through the use of nuclear weapons, is not sound policy. Instead, measures need to be in place to deter and, if necessary, respond to this threat in ways that impose heavy costs for Russian misbehavior but do not further escalate the conflict.\n\nFurther escalation will depend on the battlefield situation\n\nUkraine has used the arms the United States and its NATO allies have provided to launch successful counter-offensives in the Kharkiv region and in parts of the Kherson region, and it has clawed back some of Russias mid-summer gains in Donbas. The jury is out as to whether these events will lead to a collapse of the Russian military effort in Ukraine or to a prolonged stalemate. While there are many signs of potential Russian military collapse, Russian forces are now digging in with the natural advantages of defensive positions. With more competent leadership under General Sergei Surovikin and additional manpower through mobilization, Moscow may be able to break the Ukrainian momentum and sustain a stalemate for some time.\n\nPutin is unlikely to escalate to the tactical nuclear level if his forces manage to stabilize the battle lines. In that case, he would probably pursue his objectives through a war of attrition, continued efforts to impose a ceasefire, and attempts to divide NATO with calls for negotiations that would prevent Ukraine from recovering any more lost territory.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the United States and NATO should continue their successful policy of arms transfers to Kyiv, focusing on increased numbers of high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), long-range artillery, offensive drones, modern tanks, and armored fighting vehicles to retake lost territory. In addition, they should supply air-defense and counter-drone systems to deal with Russias attack on Ukrainian cities. They should continue to do their utmost to achieve a Ukrainian victoryat least the recovery of most territory occupied since February 24 while avoiding escalating to a NATO-Russian war. Despite Russian rhetoric about a \"proxy war\" with the United States and NATO, Putin is keen to avoid direct NATO involvement, especially given the decimation of Russian equipment and manpower.\n\nCan negotiations prevent further escalation?\n\nThe battlefield situation is not ripe for negotiations at this time. Russia has the largest incentive to establish a ceasefire that would allow it to retain Ukrainian territory it now occupies and that it risks losing to the Ukrainian counter-offensive.\n\nSince the Kharkiv offensive, Ukraine has been on a roll militarily and has little reason to negotiate given Russian brutality against civilians, rampant war crimes, and efforts to eradicate Ukrainian national identity. Ukraine has also shifted its declared war aims from recovering all territory occupied since February 24 to recapturing all territory lost since 2014, including Crimea. There is zero interest in Kyiv in giving Putin any concessions when Russia is still demanding Ukraines political subjugation and demilitarization. Washington has stated that it will leave it to Ukraine to decide if and when to negotiate, effectively letting Ukraine strengthen its negotiating leverage on the battlefield before sitting down at the negotiating table.\n\nIf Ukraine can recapture more territory quickly, without further Russian escalation, then negotiations may not be needed. However, the need for a negotiated solution might increase if Russia can create a stalemate on the battlefield. If Ukraine continues with its successful counter-offensives, Putin might seek to force negotiations on Kyiv by further escalating the conflict.\n\nThe history of the Cuban Missile Crisis teaches us that US President John F. Kennedy was able to negotiate the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba by showing strength with a military quarantine but also by providing Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev with a fig leaf, the removal of obsolete Jupiter missiles from Turkey. Should negotiations be required to end the Ukraine war, a similar formula may be needed.\n\nFor any negotiations to work, better channels of communication to the Kremlin will also be needed. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has just taken one important step in that direction with his recent phone conversations with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. More direct communications are needed to reduce the danger of unintended escalation.\n\nPossible options for Russian nuclear escalation\n\nPutin has threatened further escalation, implying that he might use nuclear weapons and stating that he is \"not bluffing.\" But Moscow has not indicated what the threshold for such escalation might beit may not know itselfand it may be a calculated bluff. Potential triggers for further escalation might include a Ukrainian victory in Kherson, additional successful Ukrainian military strikes or sabotage attacks in Crimea, the collapse or mass desertions of whole Russian military units in Ukraine, attacks on Russian cities by Ukrainian forces, the provision of long-range precision strike weapons to Ukraine by NATO, or the near-collapse of the Putin regime in Moscow.\n\nMany analysts expect that if Putin actually escalated to nuclear use, it would be either a demonstration shot over the Black Sea or a limited tactical strike against Ukrainian forces. That tactical strike (using a very low-yield device) might include one or several targets, depending on what Putin believes is required to force Kyivs capitulation. Few believe that Putin would strike a NATO country, since that would mean an instant, losing war with NATO. However, a strike against a city in Western Ukraine cannot be ruled out. His purpose would be to turn European and especially German opinion against further support for Ukraine and to convince Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he has no option but to accept a settlement on Russias terms.\n\nMore creative non-nuclear attacks should also not be ruled out: for example a dirty bomb (which Russia recently accused Ukraine of preparing to use in a false flag operation), a massive cyber strike, a limited poison gas attack against Ukrainian troops (as happened in Syria), the destruction of a major dam, or more severe attacks on a Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\n\nIs Putin bluffing?\n\nMany Western analysts believe that Putin is indeed bluffing with regard to nuclear use. They argue:\n\nA small tactical battlefield strike would have little military value since Ukrainian troops are generally dispersed and Ukraine would fight on.\n\nThe radiation would affect Russian as well as Ukrainian troops.\n\nPutins chain of command would stop him.\n\nPutin would back down because nuclear use is probably a red line for China and India, countries that Putin needs as friends for diplomatic and economic purposes.\n\nOthers take the nuclear threat more seriously. They argue:\n\n\"Escalate to deescalate\" (a strategy of limited nuclear strikes to force NATO to end a conventional conflict on Russian terms)has been the Russian doctrine for years.\n\nPutins purpose would be not to win on the battlefield but to freeze the battle and force a ceasefire or armistice on Russian terms.\n\nPutin has demonstrated his brutality in Chechnya, Syria, and Ukraine.\n\nIf Putin believes his regime or the viability of the Russian Federation is at stake, he will not hesitate to use any weapons available to him.\n\nPutin might believe that the Western coalition would crumble over a response.\n\nAssuming that Putin is bluffing is not sound policy. The West has consistently miscalculated that Putin does not mean what he says. Douglas London, a former Central Intelligence Agency operations officer for Russia, argues that as a former Cold War KGB operative, Putin will probably \"use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons if he believes doing so is the only means to preserve his power.\" Assuming that regime change in Moscow will solve the escalation problem is also not sound policy, since Putins successor is likely to have a similar KGB background and anti-Western world view.\n\nTaking the nuclear threat seriously does not mean withdrawing support for a Ukrainian victory or holding back on arms transfers. It does mean continuing to calculate the escalation risk of future NATO arms transfer decisions and to continue prudent planning about ways to deter and respond to such an attack.\n\nOptions for deterring and responding to nuclear use\n\nA prudent planner must hedge against and seek to deter the threat of nuclear use. Getting the deterrence balance right is critical. The response needs to be painful enough to deter but not certain enough to lock in the responder to any one course of action should deterrence fail.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to do this by publicly stating that there would be \"catastrophic consequences\" for Russia if it crossed the nuclear threshold. And it has privately provided some details about the nature of the US and Western response to leave Putin in no doubt that the costs of nuclear use, even a \"demonstration\" strike, would outweigh any benefits.\n\nAn array of responses to a nuclear strike (or use of any other weapons of mass destruction) would be available to NATO should deterrence fail. The mix would depend upon the nature of the Russian strike. The tools in ascending order of severity and risk might include the following.\n\nMeasures that would seek to punish Russia with limited risk of further nuclear escalation:\n\nSeeking unanimous diplomatic condemnation for nuclear use at the United Nations.\n\nRemoving Russia from international organizations.\n\nRemoving Russia completely from the SWIFT financial messaging system.\n\nImposing a full trade and financial embargo on Russia (with the support of China and India).\n\nUsing seized Russian financial assets for Ukrainian reconstruction.\n\nAgreeing on a date for Ukrainian membership in the European Union.\n\nMeasures that would punish Russia with some risk of further escalation:\n\nLifting the tacit limits on the provision to Ukraine of longer-range or more offensive weapons such as Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), F-16 fighter jets, and modern main battle tanks.\n\nAllowing Ukraine to use NATO long-range weapons to target areas in Russia.\n\nSending some NATO military advisors to Ukraine for non-combat missions.\n\nAgreeing on a date for Ukrainian membership in NATO.\n\nMeasures that would punish Russia with a higher risk of further escalation:\n\nAttacking Russian forces in Ukraine with NATO troops, for example destroying the site from which the Russian nuclear strike was launched.\n\nAttacking Russias Black Sea fleet with NATO aircraft.\n\nResponding with an in-kind NATO nuclear strike on a Russian military target in Ukraine.\n\nA prudent national security team would move carefully down this list, seeking ways to significantly punish Russia while maintaining escalation control. Allies may be reluctant to support an in-kind nuclear response, but for the sake of deterrence, NATO should preserve a measure of ambiguity about its readiness to use tactical nuclear weapons in some scenarios.\n\nHans Binnendijk is a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council.

                "cc_text": "Joe Biden is one of the few world leaders who will vividly remember the Cuban missile crisis. He was a student, almost 20 years old, when the US and the Soviet Union came to the brink of nuclear war. Now, as US president, Biden has half-mused, half-warned that the world is currently closer to nuclear Armageddon than at any time since the crisis that unfolded in October 1962 exactly 60 years ago.\n\nThere has been some tut-tutting that Biden should not be saying such things. The argument is that by publicly discussing nuclear war, the US president is playing into Vladimir Putins hands. Russias president and his army are in an increasingly desperate situation. Western intelligence services believe that the Russians are running out of ammunition and that this has only recently become apparent to Putin. By threatening to use nuclear weapons, Putin is using one of his remaining tools trying to terrify Ukraine and its western backers into concessions.\n\nBiden, however, is not alone in talking publicly about the nuclear threat. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also said that Putin is psychologically preparing the Russian people for the use of nuclear weapons. As Ukraines leader put it, this is \"very dangerous\".\n\nWith the dangers of escalation mounting alongside the death toll the absence of serious diplomatic efforts to end the conflict is both striking and worrying.\n\nFor some of Ukraines most ardent backers, even talking about diplomacy amounts to appeasement. Their argument is that the only acceptable and realistic way to end the war is for Putin to be defeated. This is fine as a statement of principle, but not hugely helpful in practice.\n\nOf course, it would be best if Russia were comprehensively defeated and a new penitent government came to power in Moscow committed to paying war reparations and putting Putin on trial for war crimes. But that outcome, while just about within the range of possibilities, remains a very long-odds bet. For the foreseeable future it is much more likely that, as his options shrink, the Russian leader and his entourage will escalate further.\n\nRussias options include economic pressure, indiscriminate bombing of Ukraine and sabotage of western infrastructure. But increasingly overt nuclear threats are also likely. The actual use of tactical nuclear weapons cannot be excluded. The frequency with which western leaders make reference to this and talk about possible responses the latest to do so was Frances Emmanuel Macron is a sign of the briefings they are getting in private.\n\nIn 1962, nuclear brinkmanship took place against the backdrop of secret diplomacy that eventually defused the Cuban missile crisis. That kind of diplomatic activity is the missing ingredient in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe big mistake is to believe that diplomacy is an alternative to strong military support for Ukraine. On the contrary, the two approaches should go hand in hand and be complementary to each other.\n\nGiving the Ukrainians the military help they need to advance on the battlefield puts them in the best possible position to secure their aims in an eventual peace settlement. But diplomacy should not simply be deferred to some point in the future. It needs to be going on at the same time as the fighting. And the Ukrainians have to be involved and consulted at every step.\n\nSome western military leaders are frustrated that their efforts in Ukraine are not being supported by simultaneous diplomacy. As one senior military source puts it: \"Military action is ineffective on its own. Its only truly effective when its combined with economic and diplomatic efforts. And were not seeing enough diplomacy.\"\n\nAlthough some might assume there is more secret diplomacy going on than meets the eye, those who should know suggest there are few channels open with the Kremlin. Senior members of Bidens team are believed to have spoken to their counterparts in Moscow. But the results have been less than inspiring, with the Russian side sticking to Kremlin-approved talking points.\n\nThird-party diplomacy might be a more fruitful path. The model here could be the deal that was reached to allow Ukrainian grain to leave Black Sea ports, alleviating the global food crisis. Turkey played a crucial role in brokering those talks. Recep Tayyip Erdoan, the Turkish president, is not everybodys idea of a stable intermediary. But he has longstanding links in Washington, Brussels and Moscow.\n\nThe Indians are also potential interlocutors. Their failure to support resolutions condemning Russia at the UN has attracted plenty of unfavourable commentary in the west. But it may make them credible messengers in Moscow. S Jaishankar, the Indian foreign minister, is also a respected operator.\n\nIn the west, some who are thinking about an eventual peace deal lay out broad parameters. Russia must withdraw to at least where its forces were before the February 24 invasion. Ukraine must have its future as a viable state assured with access to the sea, control of its own airspace and reliable security guarantees that are not dependent on Russian good faith. The status of Crimea will be the most difficult issue in any negotiation. But finding creative solutions to intractable problems is what high-level diplomacy is all about. We need to see more of it.\n\ngideon.rachman@ft.com\n\nLetters in response to this column:\n\nTurkey trumpets case for Ukraine diplomacy / From mit Yaln, Turkish Ambassador to the UK, London SW1, UK\n\nHow diplomacy averted nuclear war 60 years ago / From Robin Cooke-Hurle, London SW11, UK",

Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia declared martial law on Wednesday in four regions of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed but that it does not fully control, a move that would allow the pro-Russian authorities to impose even tighter restrictions as Moscow fights to hold off Ukraines military advances.\n\nSeparately, Mr. Putin said he was handing more power to regional governors inside Russia, implementing wartime measures that would allow for significantly more restrictions, apparently aimed at keeping a lid on dissent at home.\n\nA presidential decree announced martial law in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions whose annexation by Russia last month has been condemned internationally as illegal. Russia has suffered weeks of setbacks on the battlefield, and its proxies in the southern region of Kherson have begun relocating civilians in apparent anticipation of a major fight for the regional capital.\n\nMoscow has been ordering residents of the region living west of the Dnipro River to evacuate before a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive, a move that Kyiv has dismissed as scaremongering. Just before Mr. Putins speech, videos released on Russian media showed lines of civilians apparently boarding ferries at a river port to evacuate.\n\n\"I signed a decree on the introduction of martial law in these four constituent entities of the Russian Federation,\" Mr. Putin said at the start of a meeting of his Security Council via videoconference, referring to the four Ukrainian regions that the Kremlin unilaterally declared to be part of Russia. \"In addition, in the current situation, I consider it necessary to give additional powers to the leaders of all Russian regions.\"\n\nWithin hours of the decree, the Federation Council, the upper house of Parliament, approved it unanimously.\n\nAs of late last month, the Russian army controlled most of the Luhansk and Kherson regions and about half of the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. Martial law in the four annexed territories would allow the authorities to impose curfews, seize property, imprison undocumented immigrants, establish checkpoints, detain people for up to 30 days and forcibly resettle residents to another region.\n\nThe president also ordered the creation of territorial defense forces, a type of civilian militia, in the four annexed regions, raising the possibility that Moscows forces may try to conscript Ukrainians to fight their own countrys forces, part of a broader effort to mobilize hundreds of thousands of new fighters as its forces suffer huge casualties.\n\nMr. Putin has grappled with growing anger at home over his call-up of about 300,000 reservists to fight in the war. Protests have erupted in far-flung cities, recruitment centers have been the target of arson and thousands of military-age men have packed planes and vehicles to flee across Russias borders.\n\nSome analysts said the Russian leader is being forced to signal to his nation that there may be more pain to come.\n\n\"Putin has to prepare the country for much harder times, and he needs to mobilize resources,\" Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political analyst, said in a phone interview\n\nAnalysts said it was remarkable that Mr. Putin declared martial law, since he continues to avoid calling the invasion of Ukraine a \"war\" and instead uses the term \"special military operation.\"\n\n\"When you call it a war, it means that your special military operation failed,\" Ms. Stanovaya said.\n\nAbbas Gallyamov, a former Kremlin speechwriter turned political consultant, said the decision to declare martial law in occupied Ukraine and impose other restrictions inside Russia appeared more focused on suppressing internal dissent than improving its flailing war effort.\n\n\"In general, all this looks not so much like a struggle with an external enemy, as much as an attempt to prevent the ripening revolution within the country,\" Mr. Gallyamov wrote on Telegram.\n\nThe separate decree allows for significantly more restrictive measures to be introduced in 26 regions across Russia, closest to Ukraine, including in Moscow, to more tightly control critical infrastructure facilities, public transit and communications. According to Mr. Putin, the regional leaders will be given additional powers \"to ensure security.\"\n\nAs with many Russian laws, there are open provisions that allow for broad interpretation and regional governors can choose which they enforce. For example, the law allows for suspension of the activities of political parties, public organizations and religious groups, or any activity deemed to undermine the defense and security of the Russian Federation. It also allows governors to set up restrictions to the entry and exit from their region.\n\nReporting was contributed by Oleg Matsnev , Valeriya Safronova , Ivan Nechepurenko and Neil MacFarquhar .",

Alexei Druzhinin and Rod Lamkey/Agence France-Presse Getty Images\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with his Russian counterpart on Sunday for the second time in three days, U.S. officials said, in a conversation meant to delineate the red lines that could potentially provoke Russia to launch a nuclear attack on Ukraine.\n\nThe conversation with the Russian defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, at 7:30 a.m. Eastern time was meant to clarify for the Biden administration why President Vladimir V. Putin has been increasingly raising the specter of a nuclear strike in Ukraine, two officials said. With his forces on the back foot there, Mr. Putin has sought to portray territory in Ukraine he illegally annexed as part of \"Mother Russia,\" saying that any American-backed attack inside those areas would be viewed as an attack on the Russian homeland.\n\nRussias Defense Ministry confirmed the two men spoke, saying only that they had discussed the situation in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Austin and Mr. Shoigu spoke on Friday at the initiation of the Pentagon. Before that, the two last spoke in May.\n\nOne U.S. official said on Sunday that Moscows turn to Iranian drones, coupled with Mr. Putins increasingly escalatory references to nuclear weapons, meant that a desperate Russia was looking for other tools in its arsenal to use. Mr. Putins forces have faced struggles on the battlefield in Ukraine and there is growing anxiety at home about his militarys handling of the war.\n\nThe conversation with Mr. Austin was among a flurry of calls Mr. Shoigu held with other top defense officials on Sunday. In talks with his British, French and Turkish counterparts, Mr. Shoigu raised concerns about the possibility that Ukraine would use a \"dirty bomb,\" according to Russias Defense Ministry. Russia publicly offered no evidence to back up its claims, and the allegations drew a swift and fierce response from Ukrainian and Western officials.\n\nUkraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called them \"lies\" that were \"as absurd as they are dangerous.\"\n\n\"We neither have any dirty bombs, nor plan to acquire any,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nA so-called dirty bomb would use traditional explosives to spray radioactive material, and Russia previously has warned of the possibility that one could be featured in the Ukraine war.\n\nThe White House called Mr. Shoigus claims \"transparently false,\" while the Pentagon said Mr. Austin \"rejected any pretext for Russian escalation.\"\n\nBritains Defense Ministry similarly refuted the claims.\n\nPresident Biden has taken pains so far to avoid escalating the nuclear brinkmanship, and has indicated that he still has no plans to directly involve American troops or the U.S. nuclear arsenal in a war with Russia. At the same time, American officials say the United States would be hard-pressed not to respond in some way if Mr. Putin uses a nuclear weapon in the Ukraine war.\n\nUkraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky, urged more support from the West given Mr. Putins nuclear threats.\n\n\"When a terrorist state raises the stakes, it must feel that it wont work,\" he said in his nightly address.",

                "cc_text": "A look at the military and political importance of the city Ukraine is fighting to recapture from Russia.\n\nUkrainian forces pressing an offensive in the south have zeroed in on Kherson, a provincial capital that has been under Russian control since the early days of the invasion.\n\nThe possible fall of the city would deal another humiliation to Russia after a string of battlefield defeats and other setbacks, further cornering President Vladimir Putin and setting the stage for a potential escalation of the nearly eight-month-old war.\n\nHere is a look at the military and political importance of Kherson:\n\nWhy is the city such a prize?\n\nKherson, which had a pre-war population of 280,000, is the only regional capital to be captured by Russian forces. The city and surrounding areas fell into Moscows hands in the opening days of the conflict as Russian troops quickly pushed their attack north from Crimea, the region illegally annexed by the Kremlin in 2014.\n\nIts loss was a big blow to Ukraine because of its location on the Dnieper River, near the mouth of the Black Sea, and its role as a major industrial centre. Ukrainian resistance fighters have challenged Russian troops for control of the city ever since, with acts of sabotage and assassinations of Moscow-appointed officials.\n\nKherson also sits at a point where Ukraine can cut off fresh water from the Dnieper to Crimea. Kyiv blocked those vital supplies after the Crimean Peninsulas annexation, and Putin mentioned the need to restore them as one reason behind his decision to invade.\n\nDuring the summer, Ukrainian troops launched relentless attacks to reclaim parts of the province, also called Kherson, which is one of the four regions that Russia illegally annexed after sham referendums last month.\n\nUkraine has used US-supplied HIMARS rocket launchers to repeatedly hit a key bridge on the Dnieper in Kherson and a large dam upstream, also used as a crossing point. The strikes have forced Russia to rely on pontoons and ferries, also targeted by Ukraine.\n\nThe attacks have disrupted supply links to Kherson and the group of Russian forces on the west bank of the Dnieper and made them vulnerable to encirclement. The shortages were exacerbated after an October 8 truck bomb blew up part of the strategic Kerch Bridge linking Russias mainland to Crimea, which has served as a major supply hub for the Russian forces in the south.\n\nWhat has been Russias response?\n\nPutin blamed the Kerch Bridge attack on Ukraines military intelligence and responded by ordering a bombardment of energy infrastructure across Ukraine.\n\nHe also declared martial law in Kherson and the three other annexed regions in a bid to cement Moscows grip.\n\nBut as Ukrainian forces stubbornly pressed their offensive to the southwest alongside the Dnieper, Russian troops have found it increasingly difficult to stem their advance.\n\nGeneral Sergei Surovikin, the newly appointed Russian commander in Ukraine, appeared to set the stage for a possible withdrawal from Kherson, acknowledging the situation in the region was \"quite difficult\" for Moscow and noting that the combat situation there was still evolving.\n\nRussian authorities, who initially dismissed talk of evacuating the city, sharply changed course this week, warning that Kherson could come under massive Ukrainian shelling and encouraging residents to leave but only to Russian-held areas. Officials said 15,000 people of an expected 60,000 had been relocated by Thursday. Officials of the Moscow-appointed regional administration also pulled back, along with other civil servants.\n\nMoscow has warned that Ukraine might try to attack the dam at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant about 50km (30 miles) upstream and flood broad areas, including the city of Kherson. Ukraine denies that and, in turn, accused Russia of planning to blow it up to cause catastrophic flooding before its retreat.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alleged the dam had been mined by Russia and urged world leaders to make clear to the Kremlin that blowing it up would \"mean exactly the same as the use of weapons of mass destruction\".\n\nWhat would losing Kherson mean for Russia?\n\nA retreat from Kherson and other areas on the Dniepers west bank would shatter Russian hopes to press an offensive west to Mykolaiv and Odesa to cut off Ukraines access to the Black Sea. Such a move would deal a devastating blow to its economy. It would also allow Moscow to potentially build a land corridor to the separatist Transnistria region of Moldova, home to a crucial Russian military base.\n\n\"The loss of Kherson will turn all those southern dreams by the Kremlin into dust,\" said Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov.\n\n\"Kherson is a key to the entire southern region, which would allow Ukraine to target key supply routes for the Russian forces. Russians will try to retain control of it using all means.\"\n\nFor Ukraine, capturing Kherson would set the stage for reclaiming the Russia-held part of the Zaporizhia region and other areas in the south, and eventually pushing back into Crimea.\n\n\"Ukraine just needs to wait until Kherson falls into its hands like a ripe apple, because the situation with supplies for the Russian group of forces keeps exacerbating by the day,\" Zhdanov said.\n\nUkraine hopes to quickly double the number of US-supplied HIMARS rocket launchers that could precisely strike targets 80km (50 miles) away, he said.\n\nReclaiming control of Kherson would also mean Kyiv could again cut off water to Crimea.\n\n\"After the de-occupation of Kherson, the Russians will again have problems with fresh water in Crimea,\" Zhdanov added. He said Putin could up the ante if faced with losing Kherson.\n\n\"The Russians would be ready to wipe Kherson off the face of the Earth rather than give it to Ukraine,\" Zhdanov said.\n\nDestroying the dam to cause large flooding in the mostly flat area would be one way for Moscow to do that.\n\n\"The Russians want to show that a Ukrainian counteroffensive will face a tough response by the Kremlin that declared the region as part of Russia, and its scary to even think what that response could be,\" Zhdanov added.",

Although the Russian military does not have full control over these territories, the implementation of martial law indicates an attempt by Putin to consolidate power amidst military setbacks and bolster the security apparatus in response to Ukraine\u2019s ongoing counteroffensive (4)(5).

As part of this decree, Putin has also empowered regional Russian governors with additional security powers to support the \"special military operation\" and ensure the safeguarding of \"critically important facilities\" (5). \n\nThe imposition of martial law comes as Russia faces considerable military setbacks, with Ukrainian forces conducting counteroffensives, particularly in the regions of Kherson and Luhansk (5). Putin's move aims to assert Russian authority and maintain social order in the face of these challenges, as well as to support the defense against continued Ukrainian advances (6,8). The decree allows the military to impose curfews, restrict freedoms, seize property, monitor communications, and order citizens to participate in reconstruction efforts (9). This development also includes restrictions on movement in and out of Russian regions bordering Ukraine, indicating heightened security measures across a broader area (2,4)."

U.S. President Joe Biden and the State Department have characterized these measures as Putin's response to finding himself in a difficult position due to recent setbacks on the battlefield and the inability to fully control the annexed territories (2,4). This perspective suggests that Russia is resorting to \"desperate tactics\" and further cements the international stance against recognizing the annexed regions as Russian territory (3,4). The U.S. characterization may influence potential international responses by reinforcing the resolve to not capitulate to Russian intimidation and to continue supporting Ukraine's efforts to reclaim its territories (1,4,5).",

President Joe Biden, articulating the U.S. stance, noted that Putin's limited options have led him to adopt tactics aimed at brutalizing Ukrainian civilians in a bid to intimidate them into submission, a strategy the U.S. believes is unlikely to succeed and only demonstrates Russia's precarious situation (4,5,9,10). The U.S. State Department echoed this sentiment, labeling Russia's actions as \"desperate tactics\" in the face of significant setbacks and continued Ukrainian resistance (4,8).\n\nInternationally, the characterization of Putin's martial law declaration as a sign of desperation could influence other nations to maintain or even strengthen their non-recognition of the annexed territories and continue supporting Ukraine's sovereignty (2,3,6). The U.S. acknowledgment of Putin's difficult position could serve to rally further international support for Ukraine and reinforce the effectiveness of sanctions and economic measures already imposed on Russia (10). Additionally, the perception of Russia seeking assistance from countries like Iran to compensate for its deficiencies due to sanctions might prompt further international scrutiny and countermeasures (10). The collective view of Putin's actions as an indication of Russia's strained circumstances could thus shape a unified and firm international response, maintaining pressure on Moscow to adhere to international law and norms (2,3,6,10)."

A separate decree calls for heightened security in Russian regions bordering Ukraine, authorizing broad powers such as restricted movement, search and seizure, and detention without trial (5). These measures appear to extend and formalize the restrictions already experienced by Ukrainians in the occupied territories (3,5).",

Additionally, it grants extra emergency powers to the heads of all Russian regions, requires law enforcement agencies to submit specific proposals within three days, and orders the creation of territorial defense forces in the annexed regions (6). This martial law decree also introduces a \"medium alert level\" in certain Russian regions, including Crimea and Krasnodar Territory, which could lead to restricted movement and transportation as well as the \"temporary resettlement of residents to safe areas\" (10).\n\nThe newly imposed restrictions under martial law are expected to tighten security checks and limit movement within the affected areas, building upon the already curtailed rights and freedoms of Ukrainians living under Russian occupation (3). The decree provides a vague framework that gives the Russian state more legal room to maneuver, allowing for economic mobilization in regions bordering Ukraine (8) and conferring additional powers on regional leaders to protect critical facilities and support the war effort (9). This represents a significant escalation from the previous legal status in the annexed regions, which are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine and have been administered by Russia's military or its proxies (5). The introduction of martial law follows a pattern of tightening control over Russian society, which began with the suppression of independent media and continued with partial mobilization (10)."

                "more_detailed": "The Russian government, under President Vladimir Putin, has declared martial law in the four Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia following their illegal annexation by Moscow (1,3,8). While the specifics of the decree were not immediately detailed, martial law typically involves restrictions on travel and public gatherings, increased security checks, tighter censorship, and expanded authority for law enforcement agencies (1,2). This measure is intended to boost the security powers of regional governors, enforce stability in the economy, industry, and production, and support Russia's military operations in Ukraine (3,4).\n\nUnder martial law, law enforcement agencies have been ordered to submit specific proposals within three days, and the creation of territorial defense forces in the annexed regions has been mandated (5). This move comes as Russian forces face significant military setbacks and as Ukrainian troops continue their counteroffensive to reclaim occupied territories (4,7,9). The introduction of martial law is seen as an attempt by Putin to assert Russian authority and address potential resistance or non-compliance from the residents of the annexed regions, as well as to provide \"additional powers\" to the local leaders of all Russian regions (5,10)."

However, in the bordering Russian regions, such as Crimea and others, the decree permits unspecified economic mobilization that could organize residents to support military and security services (5,7). Furthermore, while the long-term effects on Russia's military position and public opinion remain unclear, the immediate enforcement is likely to result in much tighter security measures in the annexed regions. Ukraine and Western nations, which do not recognize the annexations, have condemned these moves, and Ukrainian officials have expressed skepticism about the changes altering the status quo significantly (8,9,10)."

It has no legal consequences for Ukraine and its citizens, as well as for the international community.\" Despite not fully controlling the territories, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced earlier on Wednesday he has signed a decree introducing martial law in four Ukrainian regions the Kremlin has sought to annex, in violation of international law. The regions are Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk. Martial law will come into effect Thursday, according to the decree. Ukraine called on its \"international partners to strongly condemn the intention of the Russian occupation administrations under the guise of the so-called \"martial law\" to deprive residents of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine of even basic human rights, as well as to condemn their illegal plans to legalize looting, forced deportations and mobilization,\" the statement added. The ministry said Ukraine would continue to liberate theoccupied territories and rescue the Ukrainian people.",

Putin made the comments during a scheduled Security Council meeting. \"In this regard, let me remind you that in the Donetsk People's Republic, the Luhansk People's Republic, as well as in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, martial law was in effect before joining Russia,\" Putin said during a televised address. \"Now we need to formalize this regime within the framework of Russian legislation.\" \"Therefore, I signed a decree on the introduction of martial law in these four subjects of the Russian Federation, so it will be immediately sent to the Federation Council,\" Putin added.

                "cc_text": "2:02 p.m. EDT\n\nMR PRICE: Good afternoon.\n\nQUESTION: Hello.\n\nQUESTION: Hi.\n\nQUESTION: Welcome back.\n\nMR PRICE: It is good to be back. It is good to be back from travel, even better to be back in this room of course. (Laughter.) I dont know why you laugh.\n\nQUESTION: I find that very hard to believe.\n\nMR PRICE: I dont know why you laugh.\n\nQUESTION: Im sure that Palo Alto and Philadelphia were both much nicer and more hospitable.\n\nMR PRICE: This room has its own set of perks. So with that, well get started.\n\nTwo things at the top. First, over the next week, Sudan will observe two important anniversaries. Tomorrow, October 21st, is the anniversary of the beginning of the 1964 October Revolution against military rule that caused the fall of that regime; and Wednesday, October 25th, will mark one year since the 2021 military takeover. Both highlight the Sudanese peoples longstanding struggle to achieve democratic, civilian-led governance.\n\nWe remain committed to helping the Sudanese people achieve the goals of their revolution, as a country that is stable, prosperous, and at peace with itself and its neighbors, and urge all Sudanese actors to engage constructively in ongoing negotiations toward establishing a civilian-led transition. On these anniversaries we remember the countless Sudanese who have bravely and at great risk demanded freedom, peace, justice, and an end to military rule. We honor all of those who were injured, harmed, or gave their lives for freedom in Sudan and call on the government including the military and security services to fully respect freedoms of association, expression, and peaceful assembly.\n\nAnd finally, this week, on October 22nd, the United States will commemorate the one-year milestone release of the U.S. National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality or the NGS. With the release of the United States first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, the administration reaffirmed that advancing the rights of women excuse me advancing the rights and empowerment of women and girls in all their diversity is both a moral and a strategic imperative.\n\nSecretary Blinken is committed to implementing the NGS as a core component of U.S. foreign policy and national security. When women and girls can meaningfully participate in social, political, and economic life, it results in more peaceful, democratic, and prosperous nations, to the benefit of all individuals.\n\nWith that, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Great. Thanks and welcome back, and I hope that this room is as hospitable for you as California\n\nMR PRICE: It always is.\n\nQUESTION: and Philadelphia were. I was going to begin with Iran, but since your colleague at the White House has already addressed it, and Im not really interested in you repeating the same thing that she already said but maybe my some of my colleagues are but Im going to start with something different, and that is that you will have seen that the human UN Human Rights Commission of Inquiry released its first report to the General Assembly today on Israeli activities in the Palestinian territories. And Im wondering if you have a response a reaction to what the findings of that report are.\n\nMR PRICE: Weve Matt, were well take a close look at that report. It has just been released so cant offer a line-by-line analysis at this point. But what I can tell you is that we have made our concerns about this Commission of Inquiry clear from the start. Israel is consistently unfairly targeted in the UN system, including in the course of this Commission of Inquiry. Israel is the only country thats subject to a standing country-specific agenda.\n\nWhen we re-engaged with the Human Rights Council last year and later when we were elected as a representative to the Human Rights Council, we did so knowing that the council has tremendous potential. Its precisely why we wanted to engage and ultimately why we did re-engage, but we also recognize that there are needed reforms. This is an effort that we continue to work towards to see to it that Israel is not unfairly singled out and I use that term unfairly put emphasis on that. No country the record of no country should be immune from scrutiny, but no country should also be targeted unfairly, and thats the principle that we seek to uphold.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. So you are you aware of the findings?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, the team will go through it.\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nMR PRICE: I dont have a specific reaction to offer at the time.\n\nQUESTION: Well, let me give you a very brief outline of what some of them are. And lets just set aside whether or not the commission in itself is unfairly targeting Israel or not. It very well may. Im not going to make a Im not taking a Im not making an argument on either side of that. But what it accuses Israel of doing is occupation, de facto annexation, forcible displacement; in other words, things that are very similar, if not the exact same, as what you accuse Russia of doing in Ukraine.\n\nJust last week, both the United States and Israel voted in support of a resolution condemning the Russians for these things. And so Im wondering how you square the two: whether the commission itself the creation of the commission is unfair or not, the allegations that its making are very similar to allegations that you say are credible and true in the case of Russia and Ukraine. And so whats the difference?\n\nMR PRICE: First, Matt, when it comes to the report that was just released, again, we will go through it. Well go through it carefully and thoroughly, and we can offer more feedback on the specific assertions at that time. So Im not going to go into the specific assertions.\n\nBut what I will note is that we categorically reject the blanket comparison between the actions of the Kremlin Russia in this case that has launched and waged a brutal war of aggression against another sovereign state, a sovereign state that posed and poses no threat whatsoever to the Kremlin, a military campaign that has whose toll can be measured in thousands upon thousands of lives lost, a campaign that has been condemned, as you alluded to, by countries around the world 141 countries in the case of the March vote in the UN General Assembly; 143 countries in the case of the annexation that Moscow recently announced and attempted with the four regions in sovereign Ukrainian territory.\n\nMatt, when it comes to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, this administration believes deeply in a two-state solution. It is it has been at the core of the approach that successive American administrations have taken to this conflict. We believe that only through a negotiated two-state solution can we arrive at a situation where we can have what really is our ultimate goal, and that is a reality in which Israelis and Palestinians alike enjoy equal level excuse me equal levels of security, of prosperity, of opportunity, of democracy, and crucially of dignity. And thats something were working towards.\n\nQUESTION: Right. But the Palestinians and their supporters would argue that what you accuse Russia of doing in Ukraine, in terms of war of aggression, is very similar to what is going on in the occupied West Bank. And so I guess the Im trying to find what you find is different. Because obviously Russia contests those allegations that you make against it, whether theyre right or not. Israel contests the allegations that are being made against it in this report, and by others, including human rights groups that you cite repeatedly when it comes to Ukraine, when it comes to Iran, when it comes to other places. Is the difference that Ukraine is a sovereign state, in your view, and that Palestine is not?\n\nMR PRICE: That is a key difference. You point to some of what critics are saying. Look, no country is or should be immune from criticism. That, of course, includes Israel. Some of the criticism that weve heard and weve, of course, offered our own over the course of recent months is justified. Much of it is not. And so when you point to comparisons in criticisms, I think it is important to take a step back and to recognize the profound differences between those two situations. You mentioned one of them, and it is a paramount difference.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, listen, its not me thats making the chairwoman of the Commission of Inquiry okay is a respected person\n\nMR PRICE: There are many assertions around the world that are made that\n\nQUESTION: She is the one who pointed out that just last week 143 countries, including the United States and Israel, voted to condemn Russia for its actions, not me. So sorry if you\n\nMR PRICE: I know\n\nQUESTION: I guess Im repeating the point that she has made and not\n\nMR PRICE: Youre asking the question and Im making the points.\n\nQUESTION: But let me just follow up on that point. So with the\n\nissue of the linkage. You said there is absolutely no linkage, no comparison whatsoever. Do you dispute that the Palestinians are militarily occupied, that Israel has annexed Palestinian land? Do you dispute that? Do you dispute that they have forcibly removed populations? Do you dispute that? Do you have any other different kind of information that can convince the world that youre speaking to that this these tactics you cited are, in fact, are not thats not what the Palestinians are experiencing?\n\nMR PRICE: Said, weve spoken to the reality, to the plight that Palestinians face.\n\nQUESTION: I dont want Im sorry, Ned. Im not talking about the plight and reality and so on. Do you dispute that they are militarily occupied?\n\nMR PRICE: We dont dispute that. And weve been clear about that this historical fact that\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Do you feel that this military occupation should also end?\n\nMR PRICE: the West Bank has been occupied since 1967.\n\nQUESTION: Right.\n\nMR PRICE: Our that is why at the center of our policy is the recognition that only through a negotiated two-state solution can we achieve what Palestinians seek and what Israelis seek, and that is a reality in which Israelis and Palestinians enjoy equal levels of these virtues, of these elements security, prosperity, democracy, freedom, and dignity. Thats what a two-state solution can bring about. Just as we have acknowledged historical realities and realities on the ground, weve also acknowledged, as did as have previous administrations, that were not there yet, clearly, in terms of a two-state solution or even in terms of creating a constructive atmosphere in which the two sides can sit down together and attempt to make progress towards that reality of a two-state solution.\n\nThat is why this administration from the earliest days has focused on practical measures that can provide some benefit to the Palestinian people, and you can measure those practical measures in the hundreds of millions of dollars verging on a billion dollars over the course of this administration in terms of humanitarian support to the Palestinian people. Its why we have maintained our sacrosanct commitment to Israels security, knowing that if Palestinians feel opportunity and Israelis feel security, those are conditions that can help galvanize efforts to advance a two-state reality. Were going to continue working on that. Were going to continue to set the stage so that we can ultimately seek to make progress.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. I tell you what, Palestinians appreciate all the help that the United States gives them, but they would appreciate more being free from occupation and controlling their own destiny.\n\nI want to ask you you began by citing anniversaries and so on. Well, on October 26th happens to be the first anniversary of the closure of six human rights organizations in Palestine, and you have not I mean, your position remains mysterious. Nobody understands it, really. I mean, have you you said that you received their answers or to your queries and so on, but we dont know. What is your position? Are you a year after this happened, are you calling them to reopen those, or are you saying now they are guilty of what the Israelis are accusing them of?\n\nMR PRICE: Said, we havent said either of those things. What we have said, and\n\nQUESTION: But why not? I mean, Ned, Im sorry, but why not? Its been a year.\n\nMR PRICE: Said, we have spoken I think clearly about our position on this, and our position is that human rights and the importance of civil society is applicable in countries and places around the world. Israel is no different. Independent civil society organizations play an indispensable role in reporting back, in offering facts, in scrutinizing the records. And this goes to the point I mentioned at the top of this briefing that no country should be or is immune from scrutiny, and I think our Israeli partners would agree with that.\n\nThats why we have always contended there must be an extraordinarily high bar when it comes to taking action against independent civil society organizations. We want to see that bar protected. We want to see that bar preserved. The Israelis have told us that they had the requisite information to take the actions that they did. They have provided us in recent weeks with additional information. We are in the process of reviewing that.\n\nBut this goes back to a point that we made in the days after this action was first announced a year ago. The United States does not have a relationship with these organizations. Weve long considered the PFLP a terrorist organization. Our relationship with these organizations is not what other countries and groups of countries had or have today. So there is no question about us severing a relationship. We never had one to begin with. The principle that we think is important is that civil society plays an indispensable role, plays an indispensable role around the world. We want to see that role protected.\n\nQUESTION: Lastly Im sorry. Lastly, why are you remaining silent on the increased violence that is being inflicted on the Palestinians as we speak? I mean, as we speak today, Nablus is besieged, Jenin is besieged, Tulkarm is besieged, and so on. Israeli settlers attack Palestinians day in and day out, they burn crops, they burn trees, they attack civilians, destroy cars, and so on. I have not seen a strong statement that you are condemning for instance, condemning this the settler violence against Palestinians.\n\nMR PRICE: Said, Im a bit confused by the question, because I know have offered our alarm and deep concern for the trends that were seeing in the West Bank and elsewhere. I believe Vedant has done the same in recent days. Weve noted that the recent period has seen a sharp and, in fact, an alarming increase in both Palestinian and Israeli deaths and injuries, including among numerous children. Since mid last month, at least 23 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed. Those numbers may have, in fact, risen even in recent days. Theres one analysis out that suggests that this year is the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank in nearly two decades. That is something that is of great concern. That is\n\nQUESTION: Yet you remain reluctant to condemn Israeli settler violence against the Palestinians. You have not mentioned settler violence against the Palestinians, even in your last statement.\n\nMR PRICE: Said, we always take issue, we always condemn violence against civilians, against innocent civilians. The fact of the matter is that weve seen an alarming increase in deaths on the part of Israelis and Palestinians. Some of this has been in the context, in the conduct of security operations, but theres no question that civilians have been killed. That is always something that is deeply, deeply concerning to us.\n\nHumeyra.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, I just want to follow up on a couple of things that Kirby said. So he said the U.S. has evidence that Iranian personnel were on the ground in Crimea. Thats a different level of military alliance between Russia and Iran. Im just wondering where that leaves the nuclear talks that were stalling for some time. Is the United States under these new circumstances, are you guys still pursuing to revive JCPOA with Iran?\n\nMR PRICE: Let me offer a couple broad words on the trends that were seeing, and then Ill come to your question. But the reports and the information that we are providing today that youve heard from Kirby, that youll hear from us as well, speak to really the evolution of Russias campaign in Ukraine that weve seen over the course since February 24th of this year.\n\nWhen President Putin first ordered his forces into Ukraine, Russia, I think it is fair to say, had grandiose objectives. Russias objective was to wipe out the Ukrainian state. It was to eliminate the Ukrainian Government, Ukrainian democracy, in many ways Ukrainian identity itself. It is wrapped up in this warped and perverse notion that Ukraine does not have the right to exist as a country.\n\nAnd so weve seen those grandiose objectives really transform into I think what is better described as grotesque objectives. As Russia has recognized that its not in a position to realize those grandiose ambitions, its turned to the grotesque. It has gone from seeking to topple the state and to erase a people and a country to targeting and hitting power grids, electricity supplies, even more horrifically neighborhoods, residential buildings, shopping malls, train stations, schools.\n\nIn all of this, its true that Russia has grown more desperate in recent months, and weve seen any number of indications of this desperation the mass mobilization, the repression within Russia that has followed this mass mobilization, the attempts to annex by force, the imposition of martial law in the regions that President Putin sought to annex. Just think about that for a second. President Putin annexed these regions claiming that there were individuals in these regions who so desperately sought refuge from the Ukrainian state that they wanted to join Mother Russia. Now, Putin is I think proving the lie by declaring martial law, martial law in regions that he claimed just a couple weeks ago so desperately sought to join Russia.\n\nI think the fact is that even though Russia is desperate doesnt make it any less dangerous in some ways, and weve seen that in Russia, perhaps out of desperation, turning to countries like Iran to provide the wares that it is unable to produce or to acquire through other means. Some of this is a reflection of the export controls, of the sanctions, of the economic measures that weve imposed on Russia. The fact is that they dont have the ability to organically produce, to import, the key inputs that they need, and so theyre turning to Iran. Theyre exploring arrangements with North Korea.\n\nAnd so as you heard from my colleague from the White House today, we can confirm that Russian military personnel based in Crimea have been piloted piloting, excuse me, Iranian UAVs and using them to conduct kinetic strikes across Ukraine, including in strikes against Kyiv in recent days. We assess that Iranian personnel, Iranian military personnel, were on the ground in Crimea and assisted Russia in these operations. Russia has received dozens of these UAVs so far and will likely continue to receive additional shipments in the future.\n\nIn spite of all of this, weve seen Russia and Iran continue to lie, continue to claim that theres no there there. The Iranians continue to claim that they are not providing this material and for indisputable proof to continue to emerge, and some of that proof was put on display before the UN Security Council yesterday.\n\nQUESTION: Okay, but are you guys still pursuing a deal with Iran, because thats what I asked. And also Kirby said, like, were no longer were not focused on an Iranian nuclear deal right now. What does that mean?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, right now the eyes of the world are where they should be. They are on the bravery\n\nQUESTION: No, but I mean, like when he says we, like I dont Im not sure hes talking about the eyes of the entire world but mostly the eyes of United States. So like, are you guys still pursuing a deal with Iran or not, and what does the \"not focused\" mean?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, so Humeyra, at this point, of course, its no secret that a deal does not appear imminent. A deal does not appear in the offing, at least not at the moment, because Irans demands have consistently gone beyond the four corners of the JCPOA. Weve heard nothing in recent weeks to suggest that Iran is prepared or preparing to change its approach, and so right now the eyes of the world are where they should be.\n\nQUESTION: Right. But under these new circumstances, is the draft that was put forward, from your perspective, is that still on the table? If Iran were to take it tomorrow, are you guys still offering that?\n\nMR PRICE: That is a hypothetical that I dont think anyone expects to come to pass. The fact is that we continue the President let me back up. The President made a commitment that Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon. We remain determined to uphold that commitment, to see to it that Iran never does acquire a nuclear weapon. Another proposition is that we continue to believe that diplomacy is the most effective, the most sustainable means by which to realize that commitment on a basis that is both permanent and verifiable.\n\nBut the fact is that the JCPOA, the question is largely academic at the moment. And so right now were focused, as is the rest of the world, on what is happening not in a foreign capital with negotiations, but right now in the absence we are focused where the rest of the world is, on the bravery and the courage of the Iranian people.\n\nGitte.\n\nQUESTION: Thanks, Ned. On what is happening inside Iran, there is growing calls for Iran to be expelled from the UN Commission on the Status of Women. And an NGO in Switzerland that advises ECOSOC has drawn up a draft resolution, and they say that they have also presented it to Secretary Blinken to present it to the council. Any thoughts on that? Any\n\nMR PRICE: Weve made our position on this very clear. Irans membership on the UN Commission on Women is contemptible. It is beyond inappropriate. It is outrageous. Weve always been clear that some of the worst human rights abusers sit on certain UN commissions. I think this is, unfortunately, a good example of that. We have worked in the UN system beyond what weve done using our own authorities and with our own voice to condemn the violence that Iran is perpetrating against, in many cases, the brave women and girls who are doing nothing more but exercising rights that are as universal to them as they are to anyone else.\n\nWe were one of 54 countries that issued a joint statement at the Human Rights Council calling for Iran to cease the disproportionate use of force against what are undeniably peaceful protesters. We dont believe Iran should sit on this commission. Were going to look at proposals to effect that outcome. Were going to take a close look at ideas, and well lend our support where its appropriate for us to do so.\n\nAlex.\n\nQUESTION: One another question, please?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Yesterday, Iran announced that it has arrested several foreigners, including one American. And do you have any information, any update on that? Can you\n\nMR PRICE: I dont, and I am not in a position to confirm that. We have been in contact with the Swiss, who are our protecting power, and we have seen no reason to weve not been in a position to independently corroborate or confirm those reports.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Just on\n\nQUESTION: A follow-up?\n\nMR PRICE: A follow-up?\n\nQUESTION: Just to follow up on that.\n\nMR PRICE: Yeah, sure.\n\nQUESTION: Actually, getting back to to what you were saying earlier that its a lie. I mean, in your statement yesterday saying its a lie that what Russia and Iran is are saying. Could you just give a bit more to that? I know that its intelligence, youre probably not going to get into massive detail, but can you explain why the United States is so certain that the drones were Iranian? Is there proof on the ground from the pictures youve seen? Whats (inaudible)?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, the reason were able to offer the detail that we have not only this week, but actually going back to July is because we do have credible information that pointed to this plan, and more recently credible information that points to the presence of Iranian drones inside Ukraine, the presence of Iranian trainers inside Ukraine operating in Crimea in this case. We do have credible information that Russian officials, prior to the presence of Iranian trainers in Crimea, received training in Iran.\n\nI of course cant detail all of this, but there is a reason why we started talking about our concerns long before the world began to see indications that our concerns were justified, because we had information that was available to us, and now the rest of the world has information available to it, not only because of what we have made public and issued, but for example the session that was held at the UN Security Council yesterday where a UN expert presented to the Security Council some of the ample evidence that the UN itself has in its possession of the operation of Iranian drones in Ukraine.\n\nQUESTION: That was a closed meeting, though, right?\n\nMR PRICE: It was, correct.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, okay. So its not like the entire world got to watch.\n\nMR PRICE: No, but I think it is also fair to say that photographic evidence has emerged. There are any number of indications\n\nQUESTION: No, Im not saying that\n\nMR PRICE: that are available to people without security clearances.\n\nQUESTION: Pointing to a closed Security Council meeting as the world having seen this evidence is not\n\nMR PRICE: The world the world has seen evidence beyond that as well.\n\nAlex.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. Based on the chronology that you just laid out, you knew about this coming in July. You telegraphed. You were very consistent about the Iranians intentions. You also mentioned that you have now abundant evidence that they have been using these. You are not convinced by Iranians lies Russias lies as well, and you will not hesitate to use the sanctions you said last time, which begs the question: Why waiting this long? I mean what have we done to prevent this from happening? Iranian drones have been claiming Ukrainian lives for weeks now. Im asking it also because your boss, the Secretary, he also mentioned that Russians have turned to other countries. So can you give us any reason or two to indicate that you have been discouraging China or CSTO or other countries from doing exactly same thing that Iran is doing?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, much of this weve discussed, including at length in this room. When it comes to China, we spoke openly of our concerns in the earliest days of Russias war against Ukraine that China might seek to provide security assistance, military assistance, or otherwise to systematically help Russia evade sanctions. We were clear about the costs that would that the PRC would incur if they chose that course. We were clear about that publicly. We were also clear about that privately. So we have not sought to hide the ball there in any sense.\n\nNeither have we waited or sought to downplay our concerns about this. And this goes back to what I said just a moment ago. We have been warning very publicly, including from this podium Jake Sullivan from the White House podium since July, over the course of several months now, our concerns that Iran would provide this type of support to Russia. Today were making very clear as well that, in light of Russias ongoing shortages some of which are owed to the export controls and the other measures we put in place were concerned that Russia may also seek to acquire advanced conventional weapons from Iran that includes potentially surface-to-air missiles. That will almost certainly be used to support Russias war against Ukraine.\n\nSo as youve seen well before Russias war against Ukraine started, when we have information that is relevant to the threat that Russia poses to Ukraine, we have not hesitated to make that public. Secretary Blinken, you may recall, gave a very public set of remarks in the UN Security Council, just a few days before Russias invasion of Ukraine, where he laid out in exacting detail what we expected to happen, which, in fact, transpired. That was the only case. It was probably the most prominent. But at every step of the way, we have sought to go out of our way to make clear our concerns, to warn the world so that we can be attuned to the lies that were going to hear from Russia, the lies that were going to hear from Iran, and perhaps even more importantly to galvanize global action against these threats.\n\nWe mentioned already yesterday that we began the process together with Ukraine, the UK, and France yesterday to hold Iran accountable for its provisions of UAVs to Russia. In the UN context, it was the closed-door meeting of the Security Council to kick off a process under UNSCR 2231 led by a panel of experts. Today, the EU and the UK either took or announced important steps joining us and slapping new sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities, supporting Irans support for Russias war, and well continue to vigorously and impose and enforce sanctions on those who aid Irans support for Russias war against Ukraine.\n\nThe final point Ill make about this is that of course Irans UAV program has been a concern of ours since the outset of this administration. Much of course has been made and appropriately so about the sanctions that we imposed on an Iranian actor (inaudible) as a result of Irans support for Russias for Russias war effort, provision of UAV technology to Russia. But last October, we announced a series of sanctions we designated members of a network of companies and individuals that provided critical support to Irans UAV program and to the IRGC and to the Quds Force as well.\n\nAnd the other, I think, notable element here is that, yes, these drones pose a risk to Ukraine, they pose a deadly threat to Ukraine, but Irans proliferation of UAV technology the threat that it poses goes well beyond Ukraine. In announcing the sanctions last October, we made the point publicly that the Quds Force has used and proliferated UAVs for use by Iran supported groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, Kitaib Hizballah, the Houthis, and to Ethiopia, where our concerns of course are prevalent. So whether its through U.S. sanctions, whether it is through international sanctions, whether its through interdiction, or through other means, we are going to use every appropriate tool we have to counter the threat by Iranian UAVs.\n\nOne final point. This is all what were doing to take action against Irans technology. Theres also a lot that were doing to support Ukraines ability to defend itself against the threat from not only Iranian UAVs, but the UAV threat more broadly. We provided 1,400 Stinger missiles, surface-to-air system, that our Ukrainian partners have used effectively. We have enabled countries to provide their own sophisticated air defense systems to Ukraine. One example we pointed to was Slovakias provision of the S-300 in the early days of this conflict, something Slovakia was able to do because of backfilling support from the United States. Germany has recently provided to Ukraine important air defense capabilities, and the NASAMS systems that are on their way are another key component as well.\n\nQUESTION: What was the authority that the sanctions that you imposed last October what was that under?\n\nMR PRICE: It was pursuant to Executive Order 1338 excuse me, pursuant to Executive Order 13382.\n\nQUESTION: Which is?\n\nMR PRICE: Which is\n\nQUESTION: What does that give you the authority to\n\nMR PRICE: Which is a counterterrorism authority.\n\nQUESTION: And at the UN?\n\nMR PRICE: It was UN Security Council 22 Resolution 2231.\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: Can I ask on that\n\nQUESTION: You want to tell Ill let you come back and you could ask for us then.\n\nQUESTION: Just a follow-up. 2231, you just on this topic as well, you guys are doing a lot of this in partnership with your allies and partners to counter UAV proliferation, especially from Iran. Multiple times this week, 2231 was mentioned from this podium, and last night, there was a statement on the abundance of evidence that Iranian UAVs are killing civilians in Ukraine. But you also despite not permanently killing the JCPOA talks right now, these this theres an executive order from here and then theres the UN 2231, which expires in less than a year now, in 11 months. Are you guys working with partners at the UN Security Council to extend that? Because as you mentioned, its further than just Ukraine, the proliferation of UAVs, so whats wheres whats the administrations point of view on 2231 and looking to extend that?\n\nMR PRICE: Our point of view is that we are going to take every action we can to thwart Irans ability to use and to export this deadly technology. Weve done so under U.S. authorities. There are UN Security Council resolutions, theres a UN there are UN panel of experts. And we saw last night the UN chair this meeting to share information on the part of a UN official to assembled members of the Security Council. So were going to use every authority and tool we have because we know the destruction of this technology. We know the harm, the death, the toll that it can inflict, not only in Ukraine but in the region as well.\n\nQUESTION: But is that is that going to I mean, if theres a you could say its hypothetical, but I mean, if theres a deal, is that going to be is that embargo going to be lifted immediately under a JCPOA, as well as are you guys gonna revoke, what is it, Executive Order 13949, which\n\nMR PRICE: You are youre getting well ahead of where we are. As weve said, no deal appears imminent. We are going to, in the absence of a deal or if there one day is a diplomatic deal to permanently and verifiably limit Irans nuclear program\n\nQUESTION: The reason Im asking is because yeah\n\nMR PRICE: We are going to use every appropriate tool that we can.\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, if I can, one more question.\n\nMR PRICE: I need to move around just so we can make sure everyone gets a question.\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nMR PRICE: Go ahead.\n\nMR PRICE: Following that closed door meeting, the Russian deputy ambassador to the UN came out and he threatened to cut off cooperation with the UN secretary general if they sent inspectors to look at those drones. Are you concerned about the implications for that for, like, the Black Sea Grain Initiative or other cooperation with the UN involving Russia?\n\nMR PRICE: Certainly noted the defensiveness of that posture and cant help but keep in mind the denials that weve heard from Moscow, that weve heard from Tehran as we see these apparent pressure tactics. We think its important that the UN and every responsible UN member state stand by the various Security Council resolutions, the General Assembly resolutions, really the heart of the UN system, the principles that animate the UN Charter and the UN system. That is really beyond the stakes of Russias aggression against Ukraine, that is ultimately what is at stake.\n\nThis is about Russian aggression against its peaceful neighbor, but its also about Russias attempt to subvert the international system that has served the world effectively for the past eight decades. Its why 143 countries came together in recent days to make the point that a big country should not be in a position to bully a small country, that a country should not be able to redraw borders by force, that we dont seek to live in a world where might equals right. We think its important in the face of intimidation, in the face of attempted coercion, that countries around the world come to the defense of the UN Charter, the way in which 141 countries did in March and 143 countries did earlier this month.\n\nMichel.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, I have three questions: Sudan, Lebanon, and Syria. Sudan, more than 178 people killed in tribal clashes in Blue Nile region. Do you have any comment on that?\n\nMR PRICE: We deeply regret the loss of life. We urge an investigation into these deaths. The perpetrators of this violence should be held to account. We recognize the security situation remains fragile, and intercommunal violence remains a threat to long-term stability. We and our partners on the UN Security Council are monitoring the situation closely. Well continue to work with the government to advance the implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement and to promote peaceful coexistence among communities.\n\nQUESTION: On Syria, any comment on the reconciliation between the Assad regime and the Hamas movement?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, Hamas is a designated foreign terrorist organization. It is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group that operates a global network to raise funds to support its military wing. The group continues to threaten Israels security from Gaza; it continues to propagate the deprivation and the squalor that so many Palestinians live in in Gaza. Meanwhile, the Assad regimes outreach to this terrorist organization only reinforces for us its isolation. It harms the interest of the Palestinian people and it undercuts global efforts to counter terrorism in the region and beyond.\n\nWell continue rejecting any support to rehabilitate the Assad regime, particularly from designated terrorist organizations like Hamas. And this is yet another example of the Assad regimes reckless, continued rejection of the international communitys efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254.\n\nQUESTION: And my last question, on Lebanon, the parliament there failed for the third time to elect a new president. Meanwhile, President Aouns term ends on October 31st. Are you concerned about any power vacuum there?\n\nMR PRICE: Weve been concerned about the economic and political conditions in Lebanon for some time now, for months, longer. We had been urging Lebanese officials to put aside their own personal interests, to act constructively in the interest of the Lebanese people. The Lebanese people, after all, have been suffering for far too long as a result of the mismanagement, as a result of the corruption, as a result of the insecurity, as the result of the power vacuum that you referred to. We want to see the emergence of a Lebanese government that puts the interest of the Lebanese people first, that will put Lebanon on stable political footing, on sound economic footing, and that will address the urgent needs of the Lebanese people.\n\nQUESTION: And you would say the same thing about Britain too, right? (Laughter.) Yeah?\n\nMR PRICE: Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: No? No? Not\n\nMR PRICE: Im not going to take the bait.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nMR PRICE: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Yesterday the U.S. unsealed indictments of Russian and Venezuelan nationals in connection with an oil for microchips sanctions evasion scheme and indicated that Rusal and Oleg Deripaska are involved, or that Rusal is involved in the scheme and that he, Deripaska, controls the company. So how does the U.S. avoid sanctioning Rusal in light of these developments? I know there have been concerns about market impacts, but at this stage, with a DOJ indictment, where do you go?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, we have authorities that we can level against entities as well as against individuals. And in this case, we took action against Russian procurement agent Yury Orekhov and knowing that his companies are responsible for procuring U.S.-origin technologies for Russian end users. It is important that both the United States, using our own authorities, and that the coalition of countries dozens of countries, some 50 countries that have come together to hold Russia to account continue to go after those who are helping the Kremlin propagate this war, those who are seeking to subvert U.S. and international sanctions that have been imposed on Russia as a result, and thats what we did in this case.\n\nIn every case, when we enact sanctions against an individual or entity, we seek to minimize the broader harm: the broader harm to people in a particular country; the broader harm to the global economic system. This case is no different. We always take a look at a complete set of factors before taking such action, and we believe that we can continue to pursue those Russian individuals and entities that are responsible and that are aiding and abetting Russias aggression in Ukraine while still protecting core interests. And a core interest is of ours is stable energy supply. Youve seen us speak to a number of measures, including the price cap that were worked on with our G7 and European counterparts that will seek to do just that; that will see to it a diminution see to a diminution in Russian revenue from oil sales while securing and seeking to ensure that there remains a stable supply of global energy. So well continue to take measures that hold Russia to account while also making sure that our interests are not harmed.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Yes. My question is on Mexico. During the past weeks, Mexico has been facing a massive hacking incident targeting defense ministry servers. Among the trove of documents that have been released by the hackers are communications between the U.S. Embassy and Mexican authorities, information on joint law enforcement operations between DOJ and Mexico, assessments by USNORTHCOM of Mexican military capabilities. And the questions I have for you are two: Did the U.S. Government address this incident during last weeks security talks with Mexico? And second, did the U.S. Government transmit any kind of concern about the hacking incident?\n\nMR PRICE: So there is not much I can say on this, because of course we wouldnt speak to reports of allegedly leaked or in this case hacked documents. I think what I can say is that these reports underscore for us the notion that no country, no institution, is immune from the threats that we collectively face in cyberspace. Im not going to comment on any reference to this in last weeks High-Level Security Dialogue, but I can tell you that we work with countries around the world, including of course our Mexican partners, to see to it that we can share best practices, we can share lessons learned, to ensure or to best protect our equities and our shared interests.\n\nSo I think I would leave it there.\n\nQUESTION: So just to be clear, the youre not you are not saying that these issues werent discussed last week, right?\n\nMR PRICE: Im just not commenting on the specifics of last weeks discussion in that regard.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: I have a question on Peru. President Castillo is being investigated for several cases of corruption and he has announced that coup against him. Is the United States concerned about the stability of Peru?\n\nMR PRICE: Were closely monitoring the political situation in Peru. As you know, Secretary Blinken had an opportunity to travel to Peru earlier this month to meet with our Peruvian counterparts. Were in we continue to closely monitor the political situation. We believe that accountability remains vital to any open, democratic political system. And as Peru engages in the hard work of democracy, the OAS may potentially serve as a partner in this process.\n\nUnder the Inter-American Democratic Charter, we share a hemispheric commitment to upholding democratic values, human rights, the rule of law. That was a message that Secretary Blinken imparted in his high-level meetings with his Peruvian counterparts last week.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. On Secretary Shermans trip to Japan. So in the background briefing this morning, a senior State Department official said Taiwan will be one of the major topics. So my question is: What kind of contribution or cooperation the Secretary will seek from Japan to counter Chinas increasing pressure on Taiwan?\n\nMR PRICE: So to your question, we did announce today that Deputy Secretary Sherman will travel to Tokyo and later Seattle later this month, October 24 through 27th. This will be her fourth trip to the Indo-Pacific region since May, and it demonstrates our continued commitment to the region and to our allies, the ROK and Japan in this case.\n\nShell have bilateral meetings. Shell engage in trilateral meeting with her Japanese and South Korean counterparts, understanding the importance of trilateral cooperation on a range of issues, but of course perhaps most notably the DPRKs WMD and ballistic missile program. Theyll have an opportunity in that trilateral format and in the various bilateral meetings as well to discuss a broader set of issues. As you heard from my colleague this morning, we expect that Taiwan will come up in that context.\n\nI suspect well have more to say after her visit, but I will just say briefly that our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, we share an interest in seeing stability in the Taiwan Strait. We share an interest in seeing the preservation of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. These are issues that we consistently discuss. The Taiwan Strait is holds profound geopolitical importance, but it also holds profound economic importance. And any instability, any change in that status quo that has served the region so well since 1979 over the course of more than 40 years, would have implications not only for the people on Taiwan, it would have implications not only for the United States, but of course also for our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nAnd so its a shared interest of ours, and we often engage with them and take part in shared conversations.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: I have a question on Turkey. Deputy Assistant Secretary Erik Woodhouse, along with Elizabeth Rosenberg from the Treasury Department were in Turkey for three days. Will the trip meet the expectations on discussion sanctions and export controls imposed on Russia, especially calming the message to the Turkish business leaders? And the second question: Is there any update on Turkeys F-16 purchase and modernization request? I am hearing that technical talks and negotiations might be finalized within three months. Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: So to your question, this week a delegation led by Elizabeth Rosenberg, who is a senior official at Treasury, they did meet with Turkish officials in Ankara and in Istanbul. Id need to refer you to the Treasury Department for additional details.\n\nBut they went because Turkey is an important and valued NATO Ally that has expressed strong support for Ukraines sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence in the face of Russians Russias aggression. And weve urged Turkey through any number of channels and any number of meetings not to become a safe haven for illicit Russian assets or transactions. Well continue to do so. Its a shared interest of ours that our sanctions collective sanctions are vigorously enforced against Russia to impose the severe costs and consequences that we promised well before this aggression began. And I dont have an update for you on the F-16.\n\nSimon or Shaun.\n\nQUESTION: Its okay. Ethiopia. The there was an announcement today of peace talks in South Africa between the TPLF and the Ethiopian Government. How positive a sign do you think this is? Are you somewhat hopeful that things could be getting back to normal, that peace could be restored? Whats the role, if any, in that? Will Mike Hammer be there or somebody else?\n\nMR PRICE: So in terms of Special Envoy Hammer, he has been in the region for some time now. He remains in Addis, where hes been supporting the African Unions efforts to launch talks on the northern Ethiopian conflict, where we are urging which we are urging should begin as soon as possible. Well let the AU speak to the details of this, but hes been in constant touch with the parties, including those who are preparing to participate in the mediation effort, specifically Kenya, South Africa, as well as other key regional and international partners.\n\nIn addition to the special envoy, Secretary Blinken, Deputy Secretary Sherman, Under Secretary Nuland, Assistant Secretary Phee, our Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and others across the interagency have been pushing for a cessation of hostilities, protections for civilians and the delivery of economic assistance, Eritreas withdrawal from Ethiopia, and serious engagement in these talks, which will be AU-led. Pursuant to those efforts, the African Union Peace and Security Council and the United Nations Security Council are both scheduled to discuss the situation in northern Ethiopia this coming Friday, tomorrow. These meetings demonstrate the international communitys great concern about the situation in northern Ethiopia and the immediate need for a cessation of hostilities, humanitarian access, AU-led talks, and Eritreas withdrawal from Ethiopia.\n\nQUESTION: Sure. Just a little bit more specifically on the talks themselves, I mean, is it is it I guess its not maybe not for the U.S. to say, but do you expect something concrete to come out of these?\n\nMR PRICE: These are talks that are being led by the AU. We are going to support in every way that is helpful and that we can, but we would leave it to the AU to speak to these.\n\nI can take one final question, and then I unfortunately need to go. Yes, in the back.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. On the recent change in the U.S. border policy, is there any ongoing diplomatic negotiation with Mexico in order to improve the situation on the border? A UN agency, International Organization for Migration, just flagged the concern over the shelters on the Mexican side. According to them, those shelters are overwhelmed.\n\nAnd on Colombia, during Secretary Blinkens recent travel to Bogot, State Department said that Colombia is a regional model for promoting sustainable integration for refugees and other immigrants. So this being said, how Colombia can act as an active partner of United States in order to improve the situation on the border? Can Petro be a partner or a link, a bridge, as he is close to Maduro?\n\nMR PRICE: When it comes to our discussions with Mexico, we did have the High-Level Security Dialogue last week. It was an opportunity, not only for the State Department and the Department of Justice but also for our partners at the Department of Homeland Security, to discuss a wide range of issues, including the challenge of irregular migration that has had such an impact on border communities, including those in Mexico. And these are conversations that are ongoing. DHS oftentimes is leading these conversations, so Id refer you to the Department of Homeland Security for details of their engagement, but the department, this administration recognizes that there needs to be a hemispheric approach to migration.\n\nIts precisely why we brought together countries of the hemisphere in June in Los Angeles to put forward the L.A. Declaration on Migration and Protection that for the first time is a document that spells out principles and commitments that now 21 countries in the region have committed to take.\n\nYoure right, we did have an opportunity to discuss the challenge of irregular migration and the challenge of the exodus of refugees and migrants from the dire political and economic situation in Venezuela with President Petro and his government earlier this month. Colombia has demonstrated extraordinary generosity and support for the hundreds of thousands, for the some more than a million Venezuelan migrants and refugees who have sought refuge in Colombia.\n\nJust ahead of the High-Level Security Dialogue last week, our colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security announced that we would be implementing a new parole program, a program that would seek to disincentivize this type of irregular migration that youre referring to, the flow of irregular migrants from places like Venezuela, like Nicaragua, like Cuba, like countries in Central America, to Mexico and ultimately to the United States, because it is one that is profoundly dangerous. It is one that poses great and grave risk to those who face the horrifying decision of uprooting their lives, of sacrificing their livelihoods to make this dangerous journey to safety, to opportunity.\n\nAnd so the Department of Homeland Security launched this program to seek to stem this irregular migration, to reinforce the message that this is not a journey that individuals in the region should take. It does pose profound risks to them and their families, and there are alternatives in this case, the parole program that would see qualified Venezuelans in this case able to travel to the United States in a legal, orderly, safe, and humane manner.\n\nQUESTION: Just one quickie just one quickie at the end. Well, Russias ambassador to Washington just made some comments saying that there are no communication channels between Washington and Moscow to reduce escalation, like those that prevented a nuclear war between the two countries 60 years ago. Is that true?\n\nMR PRICE: That is not true. That is not a characterization that we would agree with. Of course, it is not business as usual with the Russian Federation, but we certainly have ways to convey messages, messages of the highest importance, to the Russian Federation when we need to.\n\nThank you.\n\n(The briefing was concluded at 3:03 p.m.)\n\n# # #",

                "cc_text": "When Russian president Vladimir Putin declared martial law in the annexed Ukrainian territories on 19 October, he also explicitly \"legalised\" the looting of the countrys cultural heritage in the name of \"preservation\".\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian press, the Russians are currently removing artefacts from the museums in Kherson, the city in southern Ukraine conquered on 2 March, but secret removal of the most valuable museum objects had already started in May when the Russian army faced a possible Ukrainian counterattack.\n\nLooting has not been limited to the Shovkunenko Regional Art Museum , with its collection of Ukrainian and Russian fine and decorative arts, and the Kherson Regional Museum, which tells the story of the region from ancient times through its material culture. The occupiers have also dismantled and removed Soviet-era monuments to the Russian imperial heroes General Aleksandr Suvorov and Admiral Fyodor Ushakov, while the fate of the monument to Prince Grigory Potemkin, lover of Empress Catherine the Great, has been more complicated. Erected in 1823, it was exiled in 1917 to the courtyard of the Regional History Museum and then disappeared entirely during the Second World War. The monument that has now been dismantled by the Russians is a replica produced in 2003. Not just the statue has been removed: the princes mummified remains in the Cathedral of St Catherine have been exhumed and taken to an unknown location.\n\nUkraine's recently occupied territories will likely not be the only targets of Russian \"evacuation\". Another decree signed by Putin on the same day as the declaration of martial law announced the introduction of \"special measures\" in the Russian regions of Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk and Rostov on the border of Ukraine, and in Crimea, annexed in 2014.\n\nThe Russian plan to \"evacuate\" the Crimean museums became known before the publication of Putin's decrees of 19 October. On 15 October, the Ukrainian ministry of Culture declared that removing the most valuable objects from the museums of Crimea and other occupied territories was in blatant violation of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The ministry urgently contacted Unesco, asking it to prevent another violation of international law by the aggressor, but it is unlikely that the Russian forces will comply with any international calls to desist. In Putins view, both Crimea and the Ukrainian regions annexed on 30 September are Russian territories regulated by local legislation, not international treaties.\n\nCrimean precedent\n\nTwo exhibitions from Crimea have become symbols of the 2014 annexation of the peninsula. One has never returned to Crimea; the other never left it.\n\nThe show Crimea: Gold and Secrets of the Black Sea, which opened at the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam shortly before the annexation in March 2014, ended with a judgment in the Netherlandish courts that the items from Crimean museums should be returned to the Ukrainian state despite the Russians laying claim to them.\n\nIf that case attracted international attention, the fate of the exhibition that never left the peninsula remains obscure. In 2008, the curators of the Suermondt-Ludwig Museum in Aachen, Germany, located 74 paintings in the Simferopol Art Museum in Crimea that had been taken from Aachen by the Red Army after the Second World War.\n\nPeter van der Brink, the director of the German museum, spent five years negotiating for these paintings with Ukrainian officials. He offered to donate five of them to the Simferopol Museum, asked for five canvases of local importance to Aachen to be returned to the Suermondt-Ludwig Museum, and agreed to give the remaining works of art on loan for 50 years. In late spring 2014, 20 of the paintings from the Simferopol Art Museum were due to be exhibited in the Suermondt-Ludwig Museum and then toured around Germany, but the planned exhibition never took place. After the annexation of Crimea later that year, the paintings came under the control of the Russian Federation. Their fate remains to be seen.\n\nUkrainian military intelligence has reported that the Russian evacuation plan includes both the removal of museum objects to storage within Crimea and the \"evacuation\" of the most valuable works to the territory of the Russian Federation. According to the Ukrainian ministry of culture, Russians plan to take away all archaeological objects made of precious metal, in which the collections of the peninsula are rich. Among the most important are the State Museum-Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos, site of the Hellenistic city near Sebastopol and the Kerch Archaeological and Historical Museum with its collection of ancient gold jewellery and coins.\n\nIt is unlikely that archaeological objects will be the only target of the Russian forces planned evacuation. Crimea has important art museums, such as the Kroshytsky Art Museum in Sebastopol with its collection of Russian painting and works by Dutch, Flemish and Italian Old Masters, while the Aivazovsky Picture Gallery in Feodosia is internationally known for the oeuvre of the eponymous 19th-century marine painter.\n\nWhat will happen to such Ukrainian treasures after evacuation to Russia remains unclear. The parallel with Nazi Germanys removal of museum collections for \"protection\" purposes is startling, with the peculiar \"legalistic\" decorum of the evacuation so similar to the approach of Third Reich officials who hid their robbery under the fig leaf of urgently adopted \"legal regulations\".",

                "cc_text": "President Vladimir Putin announced Wednesday that Russia would impose martial law in the four regions in Ukraine he illegally annexed last month as his military struggles to maintain its grip on territory amid Ukrainian advances.\n\n\"Now we need to formalize this regime within the framework of Russian legislation. Therefore, I signed a decree on the introduction of martial law in these four subjects of the Russian Federation,\" he said on national television.\n\nSpeaking to his Security Council, Putin announced the immediate declaration of martial law in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk, as well as the establishment of a new state coordination council aimed at fulfilling the objectives of his so-called special military operation.\n\nLast month, the four regions held controversial referendums on whether to join Russia, which the international community and Ukraine widely criticized as illegitimate. Some residents alleged that they were intimidated or otherwise forced into voting and that the outcome of the vote was ordained.\n\nDespite the criticisms, Putin went ahead with the formal annexation of the four regions at the end of September.\n\nPutin also signed an order Wednesday introducing new measures to Crimea, Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk, Rostov and other regions bordering Ukraine. Several of the regions, which have been important staging areas for Russias fight in Ukraine, have come under increasing Ukrainian fire in recent weeks.\n\nThe order allows for unspecified economic mobilization in the regions, and it seemingly lays the groundwork to organize residents to support the military and security services. Much about the measures is vague, giving the state more legal room to maneuver.\n\nIntense week of combat\n\nPutin's made his announcement after an intense week of combat in Ukraine. Russian forces, in response to the bombing of a key bridge to Crimea, have launched waves of missile and \"kamikaze\" drone strikes across Ukraine, killing civilians and seriously damaging critical infrastructure, such as power stations.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday night that Russias latest turn in strategy the use of so-called standoff missiles and drones against infrastructure and other targets far from the front has taken 30% of the countrys power plants offline since the strikes began Oct. 10. Russian officials have warned that more is to come.",

Sure, hes losing badly in Eastern Ukraine, but things are looking up for the Russian dictator in the Westat least on the political front that runs through every ballot box in America.\n\nAlthough the resilience, courage, and skill of the Ukrainian military has driven Putin to increasingly desperate and depraved measures to avoid further battlefield humiliation, he can see a glimmer of hope on the horizon. And its being provided by the leadership of the Republican Party.\n\n\"The GOP cavalry is coming! Hang on Vlad!\" is the clear message being sent by Republican leaders like House Minority Leader (who might very soon be Speaker of the House) Kevin McCarthy. In an interview with Punchbowl News, McCarthy said:\n\n\"I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and theyre not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. They just wont do itUkraine is important, but at the same time it cant be the only thing they do and it cant be a blank check.\"\n\nBased on McCarthys statement and those of others in the partys leadership, it is now reasonable to assume that if Republicans reclaim control of one or both houses of the U.S. Congress, they will reduce vitally needed support to Ukraine. And, of course, should Washington back off in support of Kyiv, it would be a disaster for Ukraines attempts to resist Putins invasion, and could doom that countrys heroic efforts to remain an independent democracy.\n\nAnd all this could happen at the exact moment that a reeling and isolated Putin really needs all the help he can get.\n\nUkrainian troops continue to make gains against the Russians, and new opportunities for them are emerging as Russia falters. The Ukrainian military is moving closer and closer to retaking the key city of Kherson. Putins efforts at shoring up his military through conscription are going badlyexcept where they are going terribly. The new conscripts are also very unlikely to be much help to Russias war effort, given how badly equipped and poorly trained they are.\n\nMore criticism of the Russian armys failures is appearing in the Russian media. And where there is no criticism, government-friendly Russian pundits are making grotesque, brutal suggestions that their motherland embark on even more genocidal assaults on Ukraine. Russian assaults on Ukrainian power stations, although depriving millions of electricity, are having the opposite of the intended effect, inspiring even greater Ukrainian resolve. Putins declaration of martial law in the four regions of Ukraine he claimsbut over which he has neither a legitimate claim nor controlwas seen as a gesture that, per The Washington Post, would likely produce \"little change in Russias fortunes on the battlefield.\"\n\nIn the face of this, rather than hailing the progress being made by Ukraine (with the support of the U.S. and many Western allies) against a sworn American enemy, Republican leaders are choosing now to question that support. The sentiment on the right that Ukraine is a minor concern and a waste of American taxpayer money has been steadily growing.\n\nAs early as last May, 57 Republicans voted against the $40 billion aid package for Ukraine, and since the invasion in February, polls have shown that the number of self-identified Republicans who believe the U.S. provides too much support for Ukraine has more than tripled. And while Biden administration officials, per a Politico report, hope that bipartisan support for aid to Ukraine holds, McCarthys comments are worrisome.\n\nAfter all, withholding aid to Ukraine was a signature decision of the leader of the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump (even if the way he did it was illegal and led to his first impeachment.)\n\nAnd many in the GOP have benefited over the years, as Trump did, from Russian support. This, in turn, has led to GOP politicians working hard for Russian benefactors. And even as Russia has brutalized Ukraine, it has led to a chorus of defenses of Putin from Trump and the MAGA right. (A dark irony of all this is that the GOP is hoping to ride to victory in November by stirring up public frustration with inflation, a phenomenon that is not only global and largely beyond the control of Democrats or anyone in Congressbut has actually been made much worse by Putin.)\n\n\" American voters need to recognize that it is not just U.S. democracy that is on the ballot in November, it is the fate of democracies everywhere that are threatened by Putin and his Axis of Autocrats. \"\n\nA recent interview with columnist Christopher Coldwell by Isaac Chotiner in The New Yorker provides helpful insights into why conservatives are drawn to Putinfrom his perceived role as an ally in the culture wars to the contempt they share with him for international institutions.\n\nBut it is clearly not simply the abstract appeal of Putins macho nativist authoritarianism that draws the American right to Putin. It is the result of a campaign by Putin to both win support in the West and, at the same time, to weaken the Western allianceand with it, the resolve and means to oppose him. An illustration of this came from the Biden administration, which shared a recent intelligence community review that indicated that Russia has spent over $300 million on influencing foreign elections during the past eight years.\n\nIndeed, when you look at the progress made from Putins efforts to use active measures to subvert Western democracies (in part by winning support within them) and compare it to his abject failures as a military strategist in Ukraine, it is easy to draw the conclusion that the former KGB lieutenant colonel should have stuck to the intel game.\n\nThat said, given the GOPs history of support for Putin, and the rumblings that Republican leaders may seek to dial back our aid for Ukraine at precisely the wrong momentits entirely possible that Putin may get the last laugh, thanks in great part to having opened that second front in the West.\n\nFor that reason, American voters need to recognize that it is not just U.S. democracy that is on the ballot in November; it is the fate of democracies everywhere that are threatened by Putin and his Axis of Autocrats.\n\nIt is not just U.S. rights and freedoms that will suffer should the GOP win; it is those of our friendslike Ukraine and other states currently being menaced by Russia and those that might be inspired by a Russian success in Ukraine. Thanks to reasons that the GOP leadership have made crystal clear, voters must vote like it is not just Americas future on the ballot, but that of Ukraines and of the Western world.",

All times EDT.\n\n11:25 p.m.: Over the 28 years of Alexander Lukashenkos repressive rule, Belarusians who oppose him, despise him, or just want to criticize any particular policy could feel relatively safe expressing their views inside the confines of their homes, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.\n\nNow they may want to think again, legal and digital experts say -- especially if they use things like GPS tracking apps, online dating services, or a voice-controlled virtual assistant like Alisa, a product of the Russia-based Internet company Yandex.\n\nLukashenka signed a decree last week requiring telecom operators and website owners to connect to a new, state-designed system that would allow the Belarusian KGB to surveil almost any online activity.\n\nThe October 18 decree crystalizes a law passed last year that on paper gave state security agencies unlimited powers to spy on citizens digital footprints, including at-home smart devices, but provided no mechanism for doing so.\n\nIn combination with the 2021 law, the new decree allows the KGB to access information that Internet providers, websites, and databases store on individuals from the pages they visit and the messages they post on forums to their activity with online banking services, dating sites, and more.\n\n9:08 p.m.: U.S. automaker Ford has completed its withdrawal from the Russian market with the sale of its 49% stake in the Russian-based Sollers Ford joint venture, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported Thursday.\n\nFord said it had finalized the deal to sell its stake in Sollers Ford for a \"nominal\" undisclosed price.\n\nFord secured an option to buy back the shares within a five-year period \"should the global situation\" change in the coming years, the company said. The joint venture with Russian company Sollers was established in 2011.\n\nFord suspended its business operations in Russia in March citing deep concerns about Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. At the time, Ford took a $122 million write-down in connected with the suspension while stressing that it had already greatly reduced its presence in Russia.\n\nA slew of foreign automakers have halted operations in Russia or exited entirely.\n\nEarlier on October 26, German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz said it would exit Russia by selling shares in its industrial and financial services subsidiaries to a local investor.\n\n8:28 p.m.:\n\n7:51 p.m.: A local official told Russian conscripts, \"You are not cannon fodder,\" in a video published online recently. The men responded by angrily shouting that, actually, that's exactly what they are. The incident, in the Ardatovsky district some 360 kilometers east of Moscow, followed a stream of videos in which Russian conscripts complain of old equipment and poor training. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n7:03 p.m.: Germany is struggling to ramp up defense procurement or even just replace arms and munitions it has supplied to Kyiv, several sources told Reuters eight months after Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged 100 billion euros to bring the military up to speed, Reuters reported.\n\n\"There is almost no movement at all,\" a source involved in German defense procurement procedures said on Thursday, adding very few orders had been placed so far.\n\nThe source was echoed by managers in the defense industry who expressed disappointment at what they see as the governments sluggishness in replenishing the Bundeswehrs inventories, caused by slow procedures and a lack of decisions at the top level.\n\n\"We would have expected to see many more orders by now,\" one defense industry manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.\n\n6:13 p.m.: The Ukrainian interior ministry said in a statement Thursday that local police found a mass grave outside the city of Izium, which Ukraines forces retook last month as part of a sweeping offensive in the northeast, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe statement cited locals as saying that Russian troops dumped the bodies in a pit outside the nearby village of Kopanky in mid-April and then leveled the ground with tanks.\n\n\"Locals say that (Ukrainian) soldiers died in battle and were buried there. The Russians did not put a single mark on the grave and did not allow the villagers to go to the cemetery. People found three crosses, and (used them to) mark the perimeter of the grave, removed weeds,\" Dmytro Soima, a local police representative, was cited as saying in the ministrys statement.\n\nHis account could not be independently verified.\n\n5:18 p.m.: Residents of Ukraines capital Kyiv have been getting creative amid power cuts, Reuters reported Thursday.\n\nWhen near-daily rolling blackouts began in his Kyiv apartment block, Taras Logginov knew anyone getting stuck in the lifts of the 17-storey building would appreciate some basic supplies to help them through the ordeal.\n\nWith Russian strikes on Ukraine's power infrastructure now wreaking havoc on the hundreds of high rises in the capital Logginov and other thoughtful residents regularly leave so-called \"survival kits\" in lifts across the city.\n\nA typical pack contains water, energy bars and sweets, a torch and a container for going to the toilet. Logginov also includes extra items such as bubble solution to keep children entertained, or a square of foam to sit on.\n\n\"I could of course claim that I thought of this myself, but in truth I saw it on the internet,\" grinned Logginov, 63, referring to dozens of social media posts offering tips on how to survive blackouts that can last several hours.\n\n4:31 p.m.:\n\n3:29 p.m.: The Ukrainian capital Kyiv and four regions may have to cut electricity supplies for longer than planned after Russian strikes overnight targeting energy infrastructure, a senior official said on Thursday, Reuters reported.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiys office, said energy supplies would be significantly limited in Kyiv itself and the central regions of Kyiv, Zhytomyr and Cherkasy and the northern region of Chernihiv.\n\nAuthorities had previously said power could be shut off for four hours a day to ease the strain on the generating system as technicians worked to repair the damage.\n\n\"According to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, due to enemy attacks, the previously approved electricity shutdown schedules in these areas will not be observed, and the duration of shutdowns may exceed four hours,\" said a statement on Zelenskiys website.\n\n2:40 p.m.: U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters on Thursday that the U.S. has still not seen anything to indicate that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to use a dirty bomb, The Associated Press reported.\n\nHe said there are continued concerns that the conflict could escalate, and said thats why it is critical for the U.S. to keep the lines of communication open with allies and with Russia.\n\n\"Were going to continue to communicate that any type of use of a weapon of that sort, or even the talk of the use of a weapon of that sort is dangerous and irresponsible,\" said Austin, who spoke with his Russian counterpart twice in the last week. \"Its important to make sure that were talking to adversaries and allies alike and making sure that that were tamping down dangerous talk.\"\n\nAsked if there are concerns Russia might use its upcoming nuclear exercises as a cover for a strike inside Ukraine, Austin said, \"Its something we continue to watch. And we havent seen anything to cause us to believe at this point that that is some kind of cover activity.\"\n\nMoscow has repeatedly made the unfounded claim that Ukraine is preparing to use a \"dirty bomb,\" an explosive devise with radioactive material, on its own territory. Western officials have dismissed the claim as misinformation possibly designed as a pretext for Russia to justify its own military escalation.\n\n2:25 p.m.:\n\n2:10 p.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin says Moscow has no intention to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\"We see no need for that,\" Putin said Thursday at a conference of international foreign policy experts, adding: \"There is no point in that, neither political, nor military.\"\n\nWithout offering evidence, he repeated Moscows claim that Ukraine was plotting to detonate a radioactive \"dirty bomb\" in a false flag attack blaming Russia. Ukraine has rejected the unsubstantiated accusation, and Western allies have dismissed it as \"transparently false.\"\n\nPutin said Russia knows the Ukrainian facilities allegedly working on the purported project and asserted, again without providing proof, that Kyivs plan is to rig a missile with radioactive waste and blow it up, casting it as a Russian nuclear strike. He maintained the goal was to politically isolate Russia and to force its allies to end any cooperation with Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior Ukrainian military officer, Gen. Oleksii Hromov, the chief of the main operational department of the Ukrainian militarys General Staff, on Thursday accused Russia of planning to stage explosions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and blame them on Ukraine in a false flag attack.\n\nRussia took control of the Zaporizhzhia plant in the opening days of the invasion. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of attacking the plant, which has been shut after continuous shelling.\n\n1:05 p.m.:\n\n12:20 p.m.: Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak reacted with scorn to a speech Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered Thursday at a conference of international policy experts, where Putin sought to cast the conflict in Ukraine as part of efforts by the West to secure its global domination.\n\nPutin accused the U.S. and its allies of trying to dictate their terms to other nations in a \"dangerous and bloody\" domination game. The Russian leader claimed that \"he who will sow the wind will reap the whirlwind.\" He said, \"humankind now faces a choice: accumulate a load of problems that will inevitably crush us all or try to find solutions that may not be ideal but working and could make the world more stable and secure,\" The Associated Press reported.\n\nIn a message sent on Twitter, Podolyak characterized Putins comments as Freudian, saying that Putin was the aggressor, and tried to blame the aggression on other countries. Podolyak quoted Putins words back to him, saying the one who starts a wind will get a storm.\n\n11:55 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that the world faced the most dangerous decade since World War II as Western elites scrambled to prevent the inevitable crumbling of the global dominance of the United States and its allies, Reuters reported.\n\nIn a broadside against Washington and its allies, which he accused of inciting the conflict in Ukraine, Putin said the West was playing what he cast as a \"dangerous, bloody and dirty\" geopolitical game that was sowing chaos across the world.\n\n\"The historical period of the West's undivided dominance over world affairs is coming to an end,\" Putin, Russia's paramount leader, told the Valdai Discussion Club. Russia did not consider the West to be an enemy of Russia despite the current phase of confrontation, he added.\n\nRussia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, triggering the biggest confrontation with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis in the depths of the Cold War when the Soviet Union and the United States came closest to nuclear war. Tens of thousands of people have been killed while the West has imposed the most severe sanctions in history on Russia, one of the world's biggest suppliers of natural resources.\n\nPutin cast the conflict in Ukraine as a battle between the West and Russia for the fate of the second largest Eastern Slav country. It was, he said, partly a \"civil war\" as Russians and Ukrainians were one people. Kyiv flatly rejects both those ideas.\n\nAsked about a potential nuclear escalation, Putin said the danger of nuclear weapons usage would exist as long as nuclear weapons existed.\n\n11:25 a.m.: Russias Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Thursday that the threat of a nuclear conflict has risen amid the fighting in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMaria Zakharova argued that \"the more the U.S. is drawn into supporting the Kyiv regime on the battlefield, the more they risk provoking a direct military confrontation between the biggest nuclear powers fraught with catastrophic consequences.\"\n\nShe charged that unlike the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when the Soviets and the United States quickly negotiated a compromise, \"Washington now keeps upping the ante, apparently believing that its capable of controlling the escalation.\"\n\nZakharova said that instead of the ongoing \"thoughtless and mad\" escalation, the U.S. should take a more responsible approach shown during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nThe warning comes as Moscow has made unsubstantiated allegations of a Ukrainian plot to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb, claims rejected by Ukraine and denounced its Western allies as \"transparently false.\"\n\n11:05 a.m.:\n\n10:45 a.m.: Europes energy crisis, triggered by Russia slashing natural gas flows amid its war against Ukraine, has forced some people to turn to cheaper heating sources like firewood as the weather gets colder, The Associated Press reported.\n\nBut as more people stock up and burn wood, prices have skyrocketed, shortages and thefts have been reported, and scams are emerging. Foresters are putting GPS devices into logs to track the valuable stocks, and fears are rising about the environmental impact of increased air pollution and tree-cutting.\n\nThe clamor for firewood is not limited to poorer nations like Moldova but has surged across richer regions of Europe, too. Germany, Poland and the Czech Republics state-owned forests are seeing much stronger demand for the limited amounts of firewood they sell as part of their sustainable forest management.\n\nOften its coming from people who have never ordered firewood before and seem unaware that it needs to be purchased two years ahead so it can dry out enough to be burned in wood stoves, according to the forest service in southwest Germanys state of Hesse.\n\nGerman forest rangers also are seeing more people gathering fallen wood in forests, often not knowing its illegal. Czech state forests, which sell wood only for household consumption, have had to limit the amount of firewood sold to individuals to prevent speculative purchases. In Poland, demand for small firewood from state forests grew 46% and larger firewood was up 42% through the end of August from a year earlier. This was even before fall, when demand for firewood is highest.\n\n10:15 a.m.:\n\n9:50 a.m.: Delegations from Russia and Ukraine are among those meeting in Australia this week to decide the future of Antarcticas pristine waters, The Associated Press reported.\n\nConservationists say new marine protected areas and rules to prevent overfishing are desperately needed, but that Russia could use its veto-like powers to once again block progress.\n\nAchieving the required consensus for action among this diverse group of 27, which also includes China, the United States and the European Union, has always been an immense challenge.\n\nAnd when two of the members are at war and relations between China and many Western nations have deteriorated consensus looms as an even bigger obstacle. Just this month, Russian bombing in Ukraines capital, Kyiv, partially destroyed Ukraines Antarctic research center.\n\nYet despite the enormous political hurdles, some remain hopeful that scientific arguments will win through. The U.S. is paying more attention to the region under President Joe Biden, and this year has sent a relatively high-level delegation led by Monica Medina, an assistant secretary in the State Department.\n\n9:35 a.m.: Ukraines Ministry of Defense said it has conducted 28 prisoner swaps with Russia since February, the Kyiv Independent reported Thursday.\n\nIt quoted Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Maliar as saying 978 Ukrainians have been released from Russian captivity since February 24, including 99 civilians.\n\nThe media organization also quoted Security Service's spokesman Artem Dekhtiarenko as saying that Ukraine has returned the bodies of 579 soldiers.\n\n9:20 a.m.:\n\n8:45 a.m.: Poland tore down four monuments on Thursday to Red Army soldiers who died during World War Two, as historically strained relations between Warsaw and Moscow hit new lows due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nThe legacy of World War II is a divisive issue in Polish-Russian relations, and the conflict in Ukraine has prompted Poland to step up the demolition of memorials to fallen Soviet troops across the country.\n\nRussia argues that it liberated Poland when its forces drove out German Nazis at the end of the war. Most Poles believe that the Soviet Union replaced Nazi occupation with another form of repression.\n\n\"This monument is a monument of lies,\" said Karol Nawrocki, head of Poland's Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), as he stood before a statue in Glubczyce in southern Poland shortly before its demolition.\n\n8:30 a.m.:\n\n8:10 a.m.: Australia said on Thursday it will deploy 70 soldiers to Britain to help train Ukrainian troops there and ship 30 more armored vehicles to bolster Kyivs war against Russias invasion, Reuters reported.\n\n\"We expect this now to be a protracted conflict,\" Defense Minister Richard Marles told ABC television. The latest package takes Australias support for Ukraine to about A$655 million ($425 million) since the conflict began in February.\n\n\"Were mindful that Ukraine needs to now be supported over the longer term if were going to put Ukraine in a position where it can resolve this conflict on its own terms,\" he said.\n\nAustralia, one of the largest non-NATO contributors to the Wests support for Ukraine, has been supplying aid and defense equipment and has banned exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to Russia. It has also placed sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals and entities.\n\nAustralian troops, who will arrive in Britain in January, will join a UK-led international training exercise but will not enter the war zone in Ukraine, Marles said.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba thanked Australia for the latest aid.\n\n7:55 a.m.: Nearly 10 million Ukrainians are potentially at risk of mental disorders including acute stress, anxiety, depression, substance use and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, according to a recent report by the World Economic Forum. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) on Thursday said on Twitter that it is stepping up assistance for those in need.\n\n7:40 a.m.: Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine's occupied region of Zaporizhzhia ordered phone checks on local residents, announcing the implementation of military censorship under Russian President Vladimir Putin's martial law decree, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"From today in the Zaporizhzhia region, law enforcement officers have begun a selective preventing check of the mobile phones of citizens,\" Moscow-appointed official Vladimir Rogov said. He said those subscribed to \"propaganda resources of the terrorist Kyiv regime\" will receive a warning, before being fined.\n\n7:25 a.m.: Uzbek workers of a waste processing plant in the western Russian city of Oryol, who were handed mobilization notices and ordered to show up at the local conscription point, asked their president for help, Reuters reported Thursday, citing a local news outlet.\n\nMoscow started the mobilization campaign, its first since World War II, last month as its military campaign in Ukraine stalled and Russian forces began to lose ground. Hundreds of thousands of men have since fled Russia to avoid being sent to the front lines.\n\nAccording to the Istoki video report, Oryol authorities sent out a fresh batch of mobilization notices this week, including 50 to workers of the EcoCity waste processing facility.\n\nHalf of the workers, however, are Uzbek nationals, it said, showing a group of men displaying their Uzbek passports and asking Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to intervene on their behalf.\n\nThe mobilization campaign drew criticism after notices were served to many people not eligible for military service, prompting Russian President Vladimir Putin to order officials to correct all mistakes.\n\nUzbekistan has warned its citizens against joining foreign armies, which qualifies as a felony under Uzbek law.\n\nUzbekistan's embassy in Moscow could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\n7:15 a.m.:\n\n6:50 a.m.: Ukraine is bolstering its defenses near the border with Belarus, Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine's General Staff said that, while troops don't appear to be gathering across the boundary, \"there are and will be threats.\"\n\nRussia has been reportedly massed troops in Belarus, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko earlier this month ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine, accusing Ukraine and its allies of planning an attack on Belarus.\n\n\"Strikes on the territory of Belarus are not just being discussed in Ukraine today, but are also being planned,\" he said, without providing evidence for the assertion.\n\n6:30 a.m.: The head of the Crimean city of Sevastopol said a power plant just outside the city has come under a drone attack, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMikhail Razvozhayev said early Thursday a drone hit a transformer and sparked a fire but didnt affect the operation. Razvozhayev said that electricity supplies havent been interrupted.\n\nCrimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, has faced drone attacks and explosions from supporters of Ukraine.\n\nIn a major setback for Russia on Oct. 8, a powerful truck bomb blew up a section of a strategic 19-kilometer bridge linking Crimea to Russias mainland.\n\n6:15 a.m.: The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a report Thursday that the war in Ukraine and economic factors may ramp up development of green energy, and the use of natural gas and other fossil fuels will level off and then decline in the next 15 years, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"The energy world is shifting dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point toward a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system,\" the IEA's executive director Fatih Birol Birol said.\n\n5:57 a.m.:\n\n5:16 a.m.: Concerns of Germans that dissipated with the fall of the Berlin Wall are now creeping back after decades of peace, according to Reuters.\n\nIt's a flashback for a nation that found itself at the geographic and political center of the Cold War.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has escalated his \"special military operation\" in Ukraine - calling up reservists and threatening to use nuclear weapons to defend Russian land, while U.S. President Joe Biden has talked of \"Armageddon\".\n\nA survey by insurer R+V found that 42% of Germans now fear a war with German participation, up from 16% last year, the biggest jump since the Kosovo War in 1999.\n\n4:45 a.m.: The latest update from Britains Ministry of Defense Thursday says that the Russian government is interlinking regional governors into the national security system, thereby taking further steps to organize society as Russias war in Ukraine comes under pressure.\n\n4:15 a.m.: Iran may soon boost its involvement on behalf of Russia in the invasion of Ukraine, according to an analysis published by Foreign Policy. In addition to supplying Russia with more drones a charge Tehran denies Iran may soon sell Fateh-110 and Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missiles to supplement Russia's shrinking supply of its own missiles. Members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard are already deployed in Ukraine and Belarus to train Russian troops to use the Iranian drones, according to reports. An Israeli news agency last week reported that 10 Iranian soldiers died as Ukraine struck Russian forces.\n\n4:05 a.m.:\n\n3:50 a.m.: The area around Kherson, one of the first cities in Ukraine captured by Russia after it invaded in February, is now the scene of intense fighting as Ukrainian soldiers attempt to retake it, The New York Times reports. A nearby hydroelectric dam is the last major crossing over the Dnipro River available to Russian forces. If Ukraine captures the dam, thousands of soldiers may be left with no way to retreat.\n\nAccording to the report, the Russian occupiers are stepping up measures aimed at getting civilians to abandon the city and flee to Russia ahead of the expected battle for the city.\n\n\"We live, like, in a dystopian movie here,' one resident told The Times.\n\n2:45 a.m.:\n\n2:20 a.m.: News reports and social media in Russia indicate that many of the soldiers heading for the frontlines in Ukraine may not be well-equipped or well-trained, according to the Associated Press.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin last month ordered the conscription of about 300,000 men to bolster Russia's forces fighting in Ukraine. During a photo-op at a military facility earlier this week, Putin was seen talking to soldiers in new uniforms and equipped with combat gear, including helmets and bulletproof vests. But independent media and rights groups suggest the call-up is poorly organized, and men are being moved to combat duty without adequate training or gear.\n\nRecruits posted video on social media showing rusty weapons and filthy living conditions.\n\nActivists also report that ethnic minorities in some regions are being drafted in numbers disproportionate in comparison to other regions of Russia.\n\n1:00 a.m.:\n\n12:05 a.m.: Chicago wheat futures gained more ground on Thursday, with slowing exports from the Black Sea region amid the Russian-Ukraine war raising concerns about world supplies.\n\nConcerns over Ukrainian grain exports mounted as data from the country's farm ministry showed that shipments have slowed over the past 10 days, with volumes so far this month 9% behind the same period last year.\n\nUkraine on Sunday said Russia was blocking the full implementation of a Black Sea grain export deal, forcing Ukrainian ports to work at 25% to 30% of their capacity, Reuters reported.\n\nThe agreement, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July, paved the way for Ukraine to resume grain exports from Black Sea ports that had been shut since Russia invaded in February.\n\nUnited Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said on Wednesday that he was \"relatively optimistic\" that a U.N.-brokered deal that allowed a resumption of Ukraine Black Sea grain exports would be extended beyond mid-November. Griffiths traveled to Moscow with senior U.N. trade official Rebeca Grynspan earlier this month for discussions with Russian officials on the deal, which also aims to facilitate exports of Russian grain and fertilizer to global markets.\n\nSome information in this report came from Agence France-Presse, The Associated Press and Reuters.",

They deny any attempts at negotiations. They continue with shelling, civilians are dying,\" Putin said. \"We are trying to resolve difficult large-scaled challenges on providing security to Russia and protecting the future of Russia, defending our people.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nIn September, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a resolution to never negotiate with Russia so long as Putin is in power in Moscow.\n\nA decree posted to the Kremlin website said a coalition of the government's defense and security agencies as well as a \"special coordinating council\" headed by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin would now have three days to come up with proposals to instill order.\n\nAnalysts and Ukrainian officials say the decree may not change much on the ground for populations living in parts of Ukraine already administered by Russia's military or its proxies.\n\nBut in a related decree, Putin announced heightened security levels extended to Russian regions bordering Ukraine to protect critical civilian and military infrastructure. The provision gives authorities broad new powers including the right to restricted movement around the country, search and seizure, and detention of individuals in prison for up to one month without charges or trial.\n\nThe Kremlin also raised security alert levels for Moscow and southern Russia.\n\nThe orders come as Russian forces have repeatedly ceded ground to the Ukrainian counteroffensive despite Russian claims to have formally annexed the territories last month.\n\nPresident Biden said the move is a sign of Putin's failures in the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Vladimir Putin finds himself in an incredibly difficult position,\" Biden told reporters at the White House. \"And what it reflects is it seems his only tool available to him is to brutalize individual citizens in Ukraine ... to try to intimidate them into capitulating.

He offered residents to relocate \"in any part of Russia,\" saying the Russian government would provide housing vouchers.\n\nKirill Stremousov, Saldo's Moscow-appointed deputy, urged residents to evacuate \"as quickly as possible.\"\n\nHe said the battle for Kherson would \"soon begin\" and Russia's forces would \"fight to the end\" not to surrender the area.\n\nHe added that residents whose homes might be damaged from shelling could receive compensation from the Russian government.\n\nEarlier in October, Ukrainian forces in the Kherson region pushed the Russian line back by 20 miles, according to the President's office and Deep State, an independent monitoring group.\n\n\"The Russians feel squeezed between our forces and the banks of the Dnipro, so they're looking for ways to punish local communities,\" said Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine's southern command, on national television. Ukrainian commanders have set a goal to liberate Kherson by the winter.\n\nRussia's new commander says safety's the priority\n\nRussia's top commander in Ukraine suggested his forces may need to withdraw amid the Ukrainian advances.\n\nIn his first interview since being appointed to lead Russia's armed forces in Ukraine Oct. 8, Gen. Sergei Surovikin told Russian state media that the situation in Kherson \"very difficult\" and refused to rule out \"the hardest decisions.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP\n\nSurovikin who has overseen the mass bombardment of Ukrainian cities since taking over accused Kyiv of targeting civilians and said Russia's focus was now on saving lives.\n\n\"We will operate with the goal of maximizing the safety of civilian population and our soldiers. That is our priority,\" Surovikin said to the Zvezda channel, a state media outlet funded by Russia's Defense Ministry.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, suggested similar schemes are a \"pretext for deporting Ukrainian citizens to Russian territory as they populate occupied areas with Russian citizens.\"\n\nIt was unclear how many residents were heeding the Russian warnings to evacuate.\n\nA travel ban for Kherson starts next week\n\nAccording to Russian state media, Kherson residents received text messages with instructions to catch evacuation buses out of the city.\n\nPro-Kremlin media reports also showed people with bags lined up to catch ferry boats across the Dnipro River.\n\nSeparately, the Russian-backed authorities announced they were closing off travel into Kherson for the next week.\n\nKherson is one of four Ukrainian regions Russia claimed to have formally annexed following a series of staged referendums in September.\n\nBoth the so-called referendums and annexation bids have been widely denounced by the international community.\n\nDespite claiming the lands as part of the Russian Federation, Moscow's forces never managed to establish full control over the territories.",

                "cc_text": "Russian president is attempting to tighten his grip on four annexed Ukrainian regions amid military setbacks.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has introduced martial law in partially occupied Ukrainian regions that Moscow claimed to have annexed last month but is struggling to defend amid an ongoing counteroffensive.\n\nIn televised remarks to members of his Security Council on Wednesday, Putin said the new measures were aimed at boosting the security powers of all Russias regional governors to support what he calls a \"special military operation\".\n\nThe declaration marks the latest escalation by Putin to counter a series of significant battleground defeats since the start of September.\n\nHere is what you need to know:\n\nWhat is in the new decree?\n\nPutins decree establishes varying levels of \"martial law readiness\" across Russia and in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories. These range from \"basic\" across all of Russia to \"maximum\" in Russian-occupied Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\nIn the four areas of maximum readiness, the order grants sweeping emergency powers to Russian-installed governors to \"meet the needs of Russias armed forces\" and calls for the institution of \"territorial defence\" headquarters with unspecified roles.\n\nAuthorities can also curb movement and set curfews confining people to their homes.\n\nRussian-appointed officials in Kherson, amid growing pressure from a Ukrainian counteroffensive, had already announced a seven-day ban on civilians entering the region. Vladimir Saldo, head of the Russian-installed administration, was quoted by state-run news agency TASS as saying on Wednesday a curfew was not needed for now, shortly before confirming that he was handing over authority to the military.\n\nShortly before Putins announcement, Saldo had called on residents to evacuate across the Dnieper river, telling them to relocate \"in any part of Russia\" and saying the Russian government would provide housing vouchers. Ukraine branded the evacuation a \"propaganda\" show.\n\nThe decree also enables governments to forcibly \"temporarily resettle\" civilians. Ukraine has accused Russia of deporting people from occupied territories, while the United States estimated in September that Russia may have forcibly deported between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainians.\n\nAdditionally, martial law in Russia automatically entails a general or partial mobilisation of troops. A partial mobilisation has already taken place in Russia and extended to the occupied regions, so it is unclear if more men will be called up.\n\nThe decree also calls for unspecified \"mobilisation measures in the economic sphere\". This is likely to provide economic and industrial support to Putins mobilisation of at least 300,000 Russian men, according to an analysis by the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW).\n\nWhy declare martial law now?\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the ISW called Putins declaration \"largely legal theater meant to legitimize activities the Russian military needs to undertake or is already undertaking while creating a framework for future mobilization and domestic restrictions\".\n\nIt added: \"These moves are likely necessary to fulfill basic military requirements, such as feeding, housing, equipping, and transporting mobilized and conscripted troops to the front lines; forcing defense contractors or other private businesses to align with government production requirements; and more easily controlling both the Russian population and the Ukrainian civilian populations in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.\"\n\nPutin said the move was a response to the Ukrainian governments failure to accept the results of a popular vote last month in the four annexed regions. Ukraine and its Western allies have rejected the legitimacy of the so-called referendums, calling them a \"sham\".\n\n\"As is well known, the regime in Kyiv has refused to recognise the will of the people,\" Putin said. \"We are trying to resolve difficult large-scale challenges on providing security to Russia and protecting the future of Russia, defending our people.\"\n\nThe introduction of martial law is the latest in a series of escalatory steps as Russia faces heavy losses on the battleground on southern and eastern fronts.\n\nVitaliy Kim, governor of the Mykolaiv region in southern Ukraine, said he believed Putins decree was intended to enable Russia to \"mobilise our people whove remained\" in occupied territory. Compelling civilians to serve in the armed forces of an occupying power is defined as a breach of the Geneva Conventions on conduct in war.\n\nAccording to the ISW, Putin \"may be setting conditions for a less orthodox kind of under-the-radar mobilization: the creation of Ukrainian-style Territorial Defense Forces\".\n\nUkraines Territorial Defense Forces are composed of a core of veterans and part-time reservists, largely officers, but can be built out by civilian volunteers in wartime who are then led by the officer corps.\n\nAccording to the ISW, Yevgeny Prigozhin, financier of the private military company Wagner, announced on Wednesday that he had put senior Wagner commander Andrey Bogatov in charge of \"creat[ing] a peoples militia\".\n\nWagner, a shadowy network of mercenaries providing fighters for hire in recent years in Syria, Mali and the Central African Republic, has embraced an ever-public image in Ukraine. The group is allegedly bankrolled and controlled by Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch known as \"Putins chef\" for his many catering contracts, through a network of front companies.\n\nHow has the order been received?\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter the introduction of martial \"does not change anything\" for Ukrainian forces. \"We continue the liberation and de-occupation of our territories.\"\n\n\"Martial law\" implementation on the occupied territories by RF should be considered only as a pseudo-legalization of looting of Ukrainians property by another \"regrouping\". This does not change anything for Ukraine: we continue the liberation and deoccupation of our territories. (@Podolyak_M) October 19, 2022\n\nSergiy Khlan, an aide to the removed head of the Kherson region, said Putins aim was \"to create a kind of panic in Kherson and an image [to fuel] propaganda\".\n\nOleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraines National Security and Defense Council, criticised Moscows move as criminal.\n\n\"Putins martial law in the annexed regions of Ukraine is preparation for the mass deportation of the Ukrainian population to depressed areas of Russia in order to change the ethnic composition of the occupied territory,\" Danilov said.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden said the measure was a sign that Putin had found himself \"in an incredibly difficult position\".\n\n\"What it reflects to me is it seems his only tool available to him is to brutalise individual citizens in Ukraine, Ukrainian citizens to try to intimidate them into capitulating. Theyre not going to do that,\" he told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe US State Department had previously said Russia was resorting to \"desperate tactics\" to maintain its grip on the annexed regions.\n\n\"It should be no surprise to anybody that Russia is resorting to desperate tactics to try and enforce control in these areas,\" State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said at a daily press briefing.",

He was due to address a summit of EU leaders, who are trying to reach an agreement on bringing down gas prices.\n\nSerious damage was reported to power facilities in Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine and Burshtyn in the west. Ukrenergo said there had been more attacks in the past 10 days than in the whole preceding period since Russia's invasion on 24 February.\n\nUkrenergo said it would use \"controlled, calculated consumption restrictions\" and warned power cuts may occur throughout Ukraine from 07:00 to 22:00. It advised citizens to check the regional network operators' websites to see how it would apply to them.\n\nSporadic power cuts have already affected parts of the capital Kyiv and many of Ukraine's regions. Russian missiles have damaged infrastructure all across Ukraine, including cities like Lviv in the west - a long way from the fighting.\n\nAuthorities have urged Ukrainians to reduce their power use in the evenings.\n\n\"We do not rule out that with the onset of cold weather, we will ask for your help more often,\" Ukrenergo said.\n\nUkraine Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko: \"We need to close the sky\"\n\nWestern leaders have condemned the infrastructure strikes.\n\n\"Russia's attacks against civilian infrastructure, especially electricity, are war crimes,\" tweeted EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n\"Cutting off men, women, children of water, electricity and heating with winter coming - these are acts of pure terror.\"\n\nMartial law\n\nRussia is now implementing martial law in areas of Ukraine that it recently annexed - Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south and Donetsk and Luhansk in the east.\n\nThe Kremlin claims those regions are now part of Russia - a claim internationally rejected and condemned.\n\nMartial law means tighter security checks and restrictions on movement in the areas affected. But the war has already curbed the rights and freedoms of Ukrainians under occupation.\n\nAdditionally, while it was decreed by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday - the Russian military does not fully control those four regions, so what martial law will mean in reality is yet to be seen.\n\nHeightened security measures are also coming into force across Russia - there will be new restrictions on movement in regions along the Ukrainian border, notably Bryansk, Belgorod and Krasnodar. The same applies to Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said Vladimir Putin was running out of options in Ukraine.\n\n\"It seems his only tool available to him is to brutalise individual citizens in Ukraine to try to intimidate them into capitulating,\" he said.\n\nRussia is moving tens of thousands of civilians and Russian-appointed officials out of the Kherson region, as advancing Ukrainian troops close in on the regional capital. Russia says people on the west bank of the River Dnieper (called Dnipro by Ukrainians) are especially at risk from Ukrainian shelling.\n\nThe region's Moscow-installed head, Vladimir Saldo, said all Russian-appointed departments and ministries would cross the river, along with some 50-60,000 civilians.\n\nBut Ukrainian officials have questioned whether large numbers of people are actually being evacuated, suggesting that images of a crowd assembled by the river are largely for show.\n\nUkraine has called on residents to ignore the Russian move.",

It controls both the only land route to the Crimea peninsula Russia seized in 2014, and the mouth of the Dnipro, the 2,200-kilometre-long (1,367-mile) river that bisects Ukraine.\n\nStaff at Kherson's Russian-backed administration were also being relocated to the eastern side of the Dnipro, Saldo said, although he said Russia had the resources to hold the city and even counter-attack if necessary. Russian forces near Kherson have been driven back by 20-30 km (13-20 miles) in the last few weeks.\n\nEight months after being invaded, Ukraine is pressing major counter-offensives in the east and south to try to take as much territory as it can before winter.\n\nELECTRICITY CUTS\n\nRussia has intensified its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's power and water infrastructure this week in what Ukraine and the West call a campaign to intimidate civilians ahead of the cold winter.\n\nOn Thursday, electricity supply will be restricted nationwide between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., government officials and the grid operator Ukrenergo said. Street lighting in cities will be limited, a presidential aide said on the Telegram messaging app, adding that if electricity use was not minimised, there would be temporary blackouts.\n\nWhile limited to Thursday, \"we do not exclude that with the onset of a cold weather we will be asking for your help even more frequently,\" Ukrenergo said.\n\nRussia has destroyed three Ukrainian energy facilities over the last 24 hours, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Wednesday night video address.\n\nA Russian missile strike hit a major thermal power station in the city of Burshtyn in western Ukraine on Wednesday, the region's governor said.\n\nZelenskiy, who has said a third of his country's power stations have been hit by Russian strikes, discussed security at power supply plants with senior officials.\n\n\"We are working to create mobile power points for the critical infrastructure of cities, towns and villages,\" Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.\n\n\"We are preparing for various scenarios,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n[1/5]A view shows the city administration building hit by recent shelling in the course of Ukraine-Russia conflict, in Donetsk, Russian-controlled Ukraine, October 16, 2022.

Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called it \"a pseudo-legalisation of (the) looting of Ukrainians' property.\"\n\n\"This does not change anything for Ukraine: we continue the liberation and deoccupation of our territories,\" he tweeted.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said Putin had found himself in a difficult position and his only tool was to brutalize Ukrainian civilians. The U.S. State Department said it was no surprise that Russia was resorting to \"desperate tactics\".\n\nUkrainian and Russian forces exchanged intermittent artillery fire on a section of the Kherson front in the Mykolaiv region on Wednesday, the impacts marked by towers of smoke.\n\nSeveral Ukrainian soldiers said they were aware of the martial law declaration but were not worried, although they warned a visiting Reuters reporter of the danger presented by Russian drones.\n\n\"For sure he's (Putin) up to no good. We understand that,\" said Yaroslav, who declined to give his last name. \"But whatever they are doing, we will screw them anyway.\"\n\nOleh, who also withheld his last name, said Russia in the past had warned about what it claimed would be escalatory Ukrainian actions only to carry them out itself.\n\n\"We are just concerned about our people in the Kherson region,\" he said.\n\nMoscow denies deliberately targeting civilians, though the conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions and pulverised Ukrainian cities.\n\nThe Kremlin placed a nuclear umbrella over the regions it says it has annexed, among nuclear threats which Britain's chief of defence staff Tony Radakin said signalled desperation.\n\n\"It is a sign of weakness, which is precisely why the international community needs to remain strong and united,\" Radakin said during a speech.\n\nBritish Defence Minister Ben Wallace met his U.S counterpart in Washington this week to discuss shared security concerns about the situation in Ukraine, a senior defence source said in response to speculation around the sudden trip.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Balmforth, Max Hunder and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Andrew Osborn, Philippa Fletcher and Grant McCool; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne, John Stonestreet and Rosalba O'Brien\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin declared martial law Wednesday in the four regions of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed as Ukrainian troops continue their unrelenting drive to retain control of the occupied territories.\n\nPutin provided few details of what martial law would entail, but restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader authority for law enforcement agencies are likely.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called the tactic an intimidation attempt by Putin the \"only tool available to him'' and said it won't work.\n\nPutin gave additional emergency powers to the Russia-appointed heads of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia provinces. Ukrainian troops have retaken land in all four of them. Putin also ordered the establishment of a Coordination Committee to increase interaction between government agencies in dealing with his struggling \"special military operation.\"\n\nThe Russian leader also signed a decree restricting movement in and out of Crimea and Russian regions bordering Ukraine, including Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk and Rostov. Security will be heightened at government buildings, transportation and communication hubs and other locations.\n\n\"I think that Vladimir Putin finds himself in an incredibly difficult position,'' Biden told reporters Wednesday, \"and what it reflects to me is it seems his only tool available to him is to brutalize individual citizens in Ukraine Ukrainian citizens to try to intimidate them into capitulating.\n\n\"They're not going to do that.\"\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, USA TODAY\n\nOther developments:\n\nEU member countries agreed Wednesday on a new round of sanctions against Iran for providing Russia with drones used to attack Ukrainian targets.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said heat would be pumped into urban buildings starting Thursday several days earlier than usual to encourage residents not to turn on electric heaters and overload a power supply system compromised by Russian attacks.\n\nUkrainian authorities said the Russian army attacked nine southeastern regions of Ukraine on Wednesday using drones, rockets and heavy artillery. The attacks once again focused on destroying energy facilities, the presidential office said. Six civilians were reported killed.\n\nThe Russian military says it has defeated a Ukrainian attempt to seize control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.\n\nThe deputy chief of Norway's domestic security agency, Hedvig Moe, said there's \"an elevated intelligence threat from Russia\" after drone sightings were reported near key infrastructure sites.\n\n11 charged with violating U.S. laws to aid Russian military\n\nNearly a dozen people and two companies were charged in two cases Wednesday with attempting to help the Russian military through unlawful schemes to export dual-use technologies, some of which were used by Russian troops in Ukraine, the Justice Department said.\n\nFive Russians nationals and two Venezuelan oil traders were charged in the Eastern District of New York with money laundering and evading sanctions in their efforts to share American military technology with Russian enterprises.\n\nIn the other indictment, unsealed in the District of Connecticut, three Latvians, a Ukrainian who lives in Estonia and two companies were charged with conspiring to smuggle a machine used in nuclear proliferation and defense programs from the U.S. to Russia. The so-called \"jig grinder'' never made it to Russia.\n\n\"This weeks indictments and arrests highlight the FBIs work countering Russias flagrant evasion of U.S. sanctions and violation of export regulations,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.\n\nFrom Russia without love: Kremlin closer to severing ties to West\n\nThere is no point in Russia maintaining a diplomatic presence in the West since Europe decided to sever any economic cooperation, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday. Lavrov, speaking to college graduates admitted to Russia's diplomatic service, said working conditions for Russians in Western nations \"can hardly be called human.\" Russian diplomats often face physical threats, he said.\n\n\"There is neither point nor desire to maintain the previous presence in Western states,\" Lavrov said. \"You cant force love.\"\n\nMost Western nations have saddled Russia with severe sanctions since its invasion of Ukraine. Russian diplomats have been accused of spying or other misbehavior and been expelled from some Western countries.\n\nLavrov said developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America need additional attention. Deals are being worked out that require diplomatic support, including business, cultural, humanitarian and educational projects, he said.\n\nRussian commander says troops in 'quite difficult' position in Kherson\n\nThe top Russian military commander in Ukraine, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, acknowledged on Russian TV on Wednesday that the situation for Russian troops in Kherson region is \"quite difficult.\" Ukraine is pressing its offensive in that southern province without regard for casualties, Surovikin said.\n\nA top Ukraine official, however, said Russian forces in Kherson are trying to scare residents with warnings that Ukraine will bomb the city and by arranging an evacuation \"propaganda show.\"\n\nThe head of Ukraine's presidential office, Andriy Yermak, said Wednesday in a message on Telegram that bombing Ukrainian cities \"is done exclusively by Russian terrorists.\" Ukraine forces are expected to soon begin efforts to retake the city of Kherson, pop. 250,000.\n\nLocal officials said Wednesday that 5,000 of an expected 60,000 had left the city, amid reports that residents are getting texts messages urging them to evacuate. Though the evacuations are supposed to be voluntary, oftentimes the only route out is to Russia or territory it controls.\n\nIranian drones a threat to Israel and its relationship with Russia\n\nThose same Iran-built drones that have deeply damaged Ukraine's energy sector and terrorized its population could endanger Israel, as well as the difficult balance it has tried to maintain in its stance on the war.\n\nIsrael has sent Ukraine humanitarian aid, but declined repeated requests for air defense systems and other military equipment as it seeks to preserve its strategic relationship with Moscow. The growing ties between Russia and Iran which has threatened using those Shahed drones on Israel, its sworn enemy complicate that relationship.\n\nOn Monday, Israels minister of diaspora affairs, Nachman Shai, said on Twitter the country should side with Ukraine and provide military aid.\n\nLt. Col. Richard Hecht, a military spokesman, said the drone attacks in Ukraine raised new concerns in Israel.\n\n\"Were looking at it closely and thinking about how these can be used by the Iranians toward Israeli population centers,\" he said.\n\nNo blank check for Ukraine if GOP wins, McCarthy says\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to discuss House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthys comments that Ukraine will get no \"blank check\" in its efforts to oust invading Russian troops if the Republicans take over the House in the midterm elections. Jean-Pierre instead thanked congressional leaders for the bipartisan effort to \"support Ukraine to defend itself from Russias war crimes and atrocities.\"\n\nMcCarthy has the inside line on becoming speaker if the GOP, as expected, wins control of the House. Any significant decrease in American backing would represent a major blow for Ukraine, which has gained ground and momentum in its attempt to repel the Russian invasion thanks in large part to a HIMARS rocket launchers and other U.S.-supplied weaponry.\n\n\"I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and theyre not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,\" McCarthy told Punchbowl News.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press",

                "cc_text": "By Euronews with Reuters, AP, AFP\n\nHere are the latest developments in Russia's war against Ukraine to know about on Saturday.\n\n1. Russia suspends grain export deal over Crimea drone attack\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRussia has said it is suspending its participation in the agreement to ensure the continuation of Ukrainian grain exports vital for food supplies to poor countries linking the decision to a drone attack on Russian ships in occupied Crimea on Saturday morning.\n\nThe defence ministry announced the move, and it was also reported by the state news agency TASS.\n\n\"Taking into account the terrorist act carried out by the Kyiv regime with the participation of British experts against ships of the Black Sea fleet and civilian vessels involved in the security of grain corridors, Russia suspends its participation in the implementation of the agreement on exports of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports,\" the Russian defence ministry announced on Telegram.\n\nThe move comes a day after UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Russia and Ukraine to renew the deal that has seen more than nine million tons of grain exported from Ukraine and brought down global food prices.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Russian military blamed Ukraine and Britain for what it called a massive drone attack on its Black Sea fleet in Russian-annexed Crimea. Moscow said \"minor damage\" was caused to one ship, and the vessels were involved in protecting convoys exporting Ukrainian grain.\n\nThe Ukrainian president's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, accused Russia of \"blackmail\" and \"invented terror attacks\" on its own territory an apparent response to Russian accusations that Ukraine was behind the blasts.\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry, Anton Gerashchenko, claimed in his Telegram channel that \"careless handling of explosives\" in occupied Crimea led to explosions aboard four warships belonging to Russia's Black Sea Fleet.\n\nThe conflicting claims from Ukraine and Moscow could not immediately be reconciled.\n\nMoscow points finger at London\n\nRegarding the UK, the Russian defence ministry also blamed \"British specialists based in Ochakov, Mykolaiv region\" for preparing a \"terrorist act\" and training Ukrainian military personnel. It also said British navy personnel blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines last month, without providing any evidence.\n\nBritain's defence ministry said the Russian claims were false and designed to distract from Russian military failures in Ukraine.\n\n\"To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale,\" it said on Twitter.\n\n\"This invented story, says more about arguments going on inside the Russian government than it does about the West.\"\n\n'Most massive' drone attack so far\n\nThe Russian-installed governor of the city of Sevastopol described a drone attack early on Saturday on Russian Black Sea fleet installations as the most \"massive\" of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n\"The most massive attack by drones and remotely piloted surface vehicles on the waters of the Bay of Sevastopol in the history of the conflict took place last night,\" Mikhail Razvojaev was quoted as saying by the TASS agency.\n\nEarlier, Razvojaev said the Russian navy had repelled a drone attack, saying no facilities had been hit and the situation was under control. All the drones involved in the attack had been \"shot down\", Razvojaev added on Telegram.\n\nThe port of Sevastopol was \"temporarily\" closed to ships and ferries after the attack, the city's authorities said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn Thursday, Razvojaev said the Balaklava thermal power plant had been targeted by a drone attack.\n\nIn April, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet the Moskva was sunk by Ukrainian forces in a major blow to Moscow. Earlier this month, an explosion struck Russia's bridge to Crimea, a symbol of Moscow's annexation.\n\nRussian claims of a new drone attack in Sevastopol come as Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive to regain ground in the south of the country.\n\nBoth sides have exchanged rocket, mortar and artillery fire from trench lines north of the Russian-held city of Kherson, where one of the war's most consequential battles is looming.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said its forces had repelled attempted Ukrainian advances in the east and had destroyed a Ukrainian military factory near the town of Pavlograd.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRussia, which launched an offensive in Ukraine on 24 February, annexed Ukraine's southern Crimean peninsula in 2014.\n\n2. Russia says US lowering 'nuclear threshold' with newer bombs in Europe\n\nRussia said on Saturday that the accelerated deployment of modernised US B61 tactical nuclear weapons at NATO bases in Europe would lower the \"nuclear threshold\" and that Moscow would take the move into account in its military planning.\n\nThe United States told a closed NATO meeting this month that it would accelerate the deployment of modernised weapons arriving at European bases several months earlier than planned, according to Politico.\n\nIts report said that an upgraded version of the B61, the B61-12, would be delivered in December.\n\n\"We cannot ignore the plans to modernize nuclear weapons, those free-fall bombs that are in Europe,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told state RIA news agency.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The United States is modernising them, increasing their accuracy and reducing the power of the nuclear charge, that is, they turn these weapons into 'battlefield weapons', thereby reducing the nuclear threshold.\"\n\nThe 12-ft B61-12 gravity bomb carries a lower yield nuclear warhead than many earlier versions but is more accurate and can penetrate below ground, according to research by the Federation of American Scientists published in 2016.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman quoted by Politico said nuclear details would not be discussed but that the modernisation of B61 weapons had been underway for years.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered the gravest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when the two Cold War superpowers came closest to nuclear war.\n\n3. EU has 'frozen 17 billion in assets' of Russian oligarchs and elites\n\nSome 17 billion in assets of Russian oligarchs and entities have been frozen in the European Union across seven member states following sanctions against Russia in response to the war in Ukraine, according to Brussels.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"So far, the assets of 90 people have been frozen, amounting to more than 17 billion in seven member states, including 2.2 billion in Germany,\" EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders told German media group Funke, including the daily Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung.\n\nAt the beginning of July, Reynders put a figure of some 13.8 billion, mainly in five countries, on the freezing in the EU of assets held by oligarchs or members of the Russian elite sanctioned by the EU27.\n\n\"If it is criminal money confiscated by the EU, it can be transferred to a compensation fund for Ukraine,\" the commissioner also said in the interview published on Saturday.\n\nUkrainian officials are calling for these frozen assets to be used to rebuild their country after the war. \"However, this amount is far from sufficient to finance reconstruction,\" Reynders warned.\n\nWestern sanctions have also led to \"the freezing of 300 billion\" of Russian Central Bank foreign exchange reserves around the world, a sum that could be used as \"collateral\", the commissioner said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Ukraine also wants to use this money for reconstruction. From my point of view, it is at least possible to keep these 300 billion as a guarantee until Russia voluntarily participates in the reconstruction of Ukraine,\" Didier Reynders stressed.\n\nIn total, and since the 2014 invasion of Crimea, 1,236 individuals including Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, but also members of the Duma and oligarchs such as Roman Abramovich, Mikhail Fridman or Petr Aven and 115 entities are subject to asset freezes and bans from entering the EU.\n\n4. Zelenskyy doubts Russian mobilisation drive is really over\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed doubt over Russia's declaration that its partial mobilisation was over, saying the poor performance of pro-Moscow forces meant more men could be needed.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu earlier said the call-up of 300,000 reservists to fight in Ukraine was complete.\n\n\"We have reports the enemy has completed its mobilisation, as if there is no longer a need to send new waves of Russian citizens to the front. We feel very differently on the front lines,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on Friday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Even though Russia is trying to increase the pressure on our positions by using conscripts, they are so poorly prepared and equipped, so brutally used by their command, that it allows us to presume that very soon Russia may need a new wave of people to send to the war.\"\n\nShoigu told Putin at a televised meeting in the Kremlin that the president's order to mobilise 300,000 people had been carried out, with 82,000 already sent to the combat zone while the rest were training.\n\nThe mobilisation Putin ordered last month after his forces suffered major battlefield setbacks was the first time most Russians faced a direct personal impact from the war. It prompted tens of thousands of men to flee the country and gave rise to the first sustained public protests against the war.\n\n5. Four million affected by power blackouts, Zelenskyy says\n\nUkraine announced on Friday \"unprecedented\" power cuts affecting a total of four million people, especially in the Kyiv region, as Ukrainian energy facilities have been heavily damaged by numerous Russian strikes in recent weeks.\n\n\"In many cities and districts of our country, power cuts have been introduced to stabilise the situation,\" President Zelenskyy said in his daily address. Ukrainian operator DTEK warned that the coming days would bring \"more severe and longer cuts\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the Kyiv region, as winter looms, the latest damage to utilities will mean outages of four or more hours a day, according to Ukrenergo, the state operator of Ukraines high-voltage transmission lines.\n\nKyiv regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba warned \"more severe and longer shutdowns will be applied in the coming days\". City mayor Vitali Klitschko said the power grid was operating in \"emergency mode,\" adding that he hoped Ukrenergo would find ways to address the shortage \"in two to three weeks\".\n\nIn the Kharkiv region, home to Ukraine's second-largest city of the same name, governor Oleg Syniehubov said daily one-hour power outages would begin on Monday.\n\nOfficials across Ukraine have urged people to conserve by reducing electricity consumption during peak hours and avoiding the use of high-voltage appliances.\n\nAFP visited a Ukrainian power plant on Thursday, where repair work was underway following a Russian attack.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We don't know how long it will take,\" said one employee, adding that the plant had been targeted twice by missiles and a third time by an Iranian-made suicide drone.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on Tehran to stop arms deliveries to Russia during a phone conversation with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian.\n\n\"I demanded that Iran immediately stop supplying Russia with weapons that are used to kill civilians and destroy critical infrastructure in Ukraine,\" Kuleba tweeted on Friday.\n\nIran has denied supplying Russia with explosive drones and other weapons used in the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's Iranian community members attend a protest against Russian and Iranian regimes in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, Oct. 28, 2022.

Stick to Moscow time and don't put clocks back, urge pro-Russian officials\n\nKremlin-appointed officials in an occupied region of southern Ukraine have urged residents not to switch to daylight saving time along with Kyiv and the rest of the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"In the Zaporizhzhia region, the old time remains. The clocks will not go back in 2022,\" the administration on Friday said in a post on its official Telegram channel.\n\nThe Russian-installed mayor of Enerhodar, where the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power plant is located, called on residents to ignore the time switch in a separate video message posted on Telegram.\n\n\"We live in the Russian Federation, and our city lives by Moscow time,\" Alexander Volga said in the video.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia region is one of four Ukrainian provinces that Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed last month and subsequently put under Russian martial law. Kremlin-backed officials in occupied areas have sought to replace the Ukrainian currency with Russias ruble, and to align local laws with Russian legislation.\n\nRussia switched to permanent winter time in 2014. The move came after nationwide surveys found that Russians largely disapproved of an earlier government decision to put clocks on year-round summer time, and struggled to adjust to long hours of darkness in the mornings.",

During a meeting of Russias security council Wednesday, Putin gave emergency powers to regional leaders across Russian regions and introduced martial law starting Thursday in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The four occupied regions of eastern and southern Ukraine are the focal point of the conflict. Moscow annexed the territories last month after staged referendums, in a move that Ukraine and the international community do not accept.\n\nIn practice, what will change on the ground in highly militarized regions already under military occupation, or under contest in Ukraines counteroffensive, remains unclear. The main change could be a new degree of cover for military actions under Russias legal system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeres what you need to know about Putins imposition of martial law.\n\nWhat is martial law?\n\nUnder Russian law, martial law expands the powers held by the military and law enforcement. It allows the military to impose curfews, restrict freedom of movement, seize civilian property, monitor communications and order citizens to rebuild destroyed cities.\n\n\"Martial law essentially means the suspension of the normal governance of the economy, of the rule of law,\" said Max Bergmann, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"It allows the military to seize civilian assets, buildings, deploy resources as needed. And essentially enables the military to call the shots.\"\n\nHow will life change in the illegally annexed territories?\n\nMoscow does not entirely control the four regions, so its unclear whether Russia will be able to effectively implement the provisions, or how they will diverge from existing conditions under military occupation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Bergmann, the decree serves as \"a formalization of a lot of what was already taking place on the ground.\" It does away with the notion that these regions had elections, are \"happily part of Russia and are being administered in a civilian capacity,\" he said. It \"gets rid of the facade and says, Well, were just militarily occupying these regions. And thats an important signal.\"\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe move could also serve as an opportunity to acquire and mobilize more resources for Russian troops, he said.\n\nWhen did Moscow last impose martial law?\n\nMoscow has not declared martial law since the Soviet Union, which preceded modern Russia, imposed it during World War II.\n\n\"During the Soviet period, Russia fought a number of wars, but it did so through its regular forces. It didnt have to do the mass mobilization needed [now],\" Bergmann said. In the past few decades, Russia invaded neighbors Georgia and Ukraine, and intervened in Syria, but those conflicts didnt require a \"mass mobilization.\"\n\n\"Theres a real disconnect in the propaganda that Putin has used to sell the conflict and the sacrifices that the Russians are being asked to make,\" he said. \"The Russian people were told this was a special military operation and now are being mobilized like its World War II.\"\n\nWhat broader impact could the decree have?\n\nIn addition to declaring martial law, Putin has imposed \"response levels\" in 26 regions, including Moscow, which some experts say could have wider repercussions for Russia domestically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Russian regions that are close to or border Ukraine Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk and Rostov,, as well as Crimea, the restrictions impose some wartime measures but are a step lower than the \"maximum response\" the Kremlin introduced in the occupied Ukrainian territories.\n\nThe measure could mean a new level of control over industries, repurposing them to support the military.\n\n\"What we see is sort of a boiling frog strategy, where instead of announcing every major step that would perhaps overwhelm the Russian public, the idea is to roll these out gradually,\" Bergmann said.\n\nIf declaring martial law proves somewhat successful and Russia still needs more troops and resources, \"it could very well expand,\" he said.",

Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nLONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday inspected a training ground for mobilised troops and was shown firing shots from a sniper rifle in footage apparently intended to show his personal backing for soldiers heading to fight in Ukraine.\n\nPutin was accompanied on the trip to Ryazan, southeast of Moscow, by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who reported to him on how the men were being trained, the Kremlin said.\n\nFootage showed a figure who appeared to be Putin lying flat on the ground and firing from a rifle. In the next frame, Putin was seen dusting down his overcoat, slapping a soldier on the shoulder and wishing him good luck.\n\nThe visit came a day after Putin raised Russia's war footing and declared martial law in four occupied regions of Ukraine that he moved to annex last month in a step condemned as illegal by Ukraine, its allies and the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nFaced with a series of defeats in the war, Putin last month declared a \"partial mobilisation\" to call up hundreds of thousands of extra troops.\n\nIt has proceeded chaotically, with frequent cases of call-up papers going out to the wrong men, and even Putin has been forced to acknowledge mistakes. Hundreds of thousands of Russians have fled abroad to escape being drafted.\n\nPutin said last Friday the mobilisation would be over within two weeks. On Thursday he ordered all Russia's regions to do more to support army needs and stressed that all mobilised men needed to be sent to the front with proper equipment.\n\nWriting by Mark Trevelyan Editing by Alexandra Hudson\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

From teachers to railway staff, more than 100,000 people marched throughout the country on Tuesday to demand higher pay.\n\nThe impact has been felt across France, which is now grappling with severe gas shortages exacerbated by the oil refinery workers strikes. Nearly 30 percent of French gas stations fuel supplies are now dried up while Tuesdays strikes also slashed train traffic.\n\nThe sweeping scale of the unrest underscores the publics frustration with soaring inflation and the governments responseand also poses a major challenge to French President Emmanuel Macron. As long queues formed at gas stations, he was forced to order an emergency meeting this week concerning the ongoing strikes.\n\nHis opponents, meanwhile, have capitalized on the unrest. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people participated in protests that a group of Macrons left-wing rivals had organized prior to the strikes; they focused on Frances rising cost of living.\n\n\"You can see that this movement is starting to spread,\" Mathilde Panot, the parliamentary head of the France Unbowed party, told Franceinfo radio.\n\nFrances ongoing unrest is part of a wider pattern of public frustration that has plagued Europe as it struggles to cope with a grave energy crisis that has led to skyrocketing energy bills. In recent weeks, protests and strikes have also embroiled Germany, Britain, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Belgium.\n\nAs anger boiled over, protesters and authorities tussled at Tuesdays protests in Paris, and 11 people were detained. As of Wednesday, some oil refineries strikes have ceased while others have continued.\n\nWhat Were Following Today\n\nBritains political turmoil. British Prime Minister Liz Trusss political career is hanging by a thread after she was grilled in Parliament on Wednesdayprompting her to declare, \"Im a fighter and not a quitter.\" Her statement was followed by British Home Secretary Suella Bravermans resignationallegedly over improper personal email use.\n\nBravermana favorite of the Conservative Partys right wingused the opportunity to fire a broadside at Truss, who has moved to the center as the governments economic agenda has faltered. \"I have concerns about the direction of this government,\" Braverman wrote in her resignation letter. \"Not only have we broken key pledges that were promised to our voters, but I have serious concerns about this Governments commitment to honoring manifesto commitments.\"\n\nRussia imposes martial law. Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared martial law in the four Ukrainian territories that he has illegally annexed. The announcement enables officials to unroll a slew of new rules while highlighting the Russian leaders own military challenges. \"In the current situation, I consider it necessary to give additional powers to the leaders of all Russian regions,\" he said.\n\nKeep an Eye On\n\nSomalias catastrophic drought. Thousands of Somali children are in danger of dying \"on a scale not seen in half a century\" as Somalia faces its most acute drought in four decades, according to UNICEF. Since August, 44,000 children in Somalia have entered hospitals for severe acute malnutrition, which amounts to a child admitted every minute, UNICEF said.\n\nMyanmar prison explosion. At least 8 people were killed after two explosives detonated at a Myanmar prison known for housing political prisoners on Wednesday. The bomb attack killed three of the prisons workers and five visitors while 18 others were wounded. The Special Task Agency of Burma, an anti-government organization, has reportedly claimed responsibility for the bombing.\n\nWednesdays Most Read\n\nUkraine Is the Worlds Foreign-Policy Rorschach Test by Stephen M.

One British tabloid, the Daily Star, has put that question to the test with a livestream of the two competitors battling for victory.

We are not afraid of the dark,\" he said.\n\nKyiv and four regions may have to cut electricity supplies for longer than planned after Russian strikes, a senior official said earlier on Thursday.\n\n01:32\n\n10:31pm: IAEA to conduct 'independent verification' of Russias dirty bomb allegations\n\nThe UNs nuclear watchdog will this week carry out an \"independent verification\" of Russian allegations concerning the production of so-called 'dirty bombs' at two sites in Ukraine, it said on Thursday.\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi said: \"IAEA inspectors will conduct independent verification at these locations... to detect any diversion of nuclear material under safeguards, any undeclared production or processing of nuclear material at the two locations and assure that there are no undeclared nuclear material and activities\".\n\n9:43pm: UN says not aware of any biological weapons program in Ukraine\n\nThe United Nations is \"not aware\" of any biological weapons program in Ukraine, a disarmament official said Thursday after Russia accused the United States of \"biological weapons\" there and called on the UN to investigate.\n\n\"We are aware that the Russian Federation has filed an official complaint... regarding allegations of biological weapons programs in Ukraine,\" Adedeji Ebo, the UNs Deputy High Representative for Disarmament Affairs told the Security Council.\n\n\"The United Nations is not aware of any such biological weapons programs,\" he said, noting that the UN also had no mandate or technical capacity to investigate.\n\n9:27pm: Russia calls for UN probe into US biological weapons in Ukraine\n\nRussia has filed a complaint with the UN Security Council demanding an international investigation into the United States use of \"biological weapons\" in Ukraine, the Russian foreign ministry said Thursday.\n\n\"The Russian Federation was left with no choice but to file a complaint with the Chairman of the UN Security Council to launch an international investigation,\" according to a statement from the ministry.\n\n9:11pm: Blinken says Russia's use of Iranian drones in Ukraine is 'appalling'\n\nRussias use of Iranian drones in Ukraine is \"appalling,\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday, adding that the United States and allies would seek to block such shipments.\n\nRussia has used the drones to \"kill Ukrainian civilians and destroy the infrastructure they rely on for electricity, for water, for heat,\" Blinken said during a visit to Ottawa.\n\n\"Canada and the United States will keep working with our allies and partners to expose, to deter and to counter Irans provision of these weapons,\" he vowed.\n\n8:08pm Kyiv, other regions set for longer-than-planned blackouts after Russia strikes\n\nThe Ukrainian capital Kyiv and four regions may have to cut electricity supplies for longer than planned after Russian strikes overnight targeting energy infrastructure.\n\nAuthorities had previously said power could be shut off for four hours a day to ease the strain on the generating system as technicians worked to repair the damage, but due to the attacks, energy supplies are expected to be significantly limited in Kyiv and the central regions of Kyiv, Zhytomyr and Cherkasy and the northern region of Chernihiv\n\nIn the video below, FRANCE 24s correspondent Gulliver Cragg reports on the situation from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n03:37\n\n7:05pm: Ukrainian troops prepare for long, and cold, winter battle in Kherson\n\nDespite the Ukrainian armys flash advance in the southern region of Kherson in recent weeks recapturing dozens of towns and villages from the Russians its pace now appears to be slowing down.\n\nEmbedded with Ukrainian forces in Mykolaiv, FRANCE 24s Jonathan Walsh reports how the troops are preparing for a long and tough battle as they close-in on the city of Kherson; chopping wood to fortify their defences, stock-piling anti-tank weaponry and installing heated bunkers.\n\nWatch the full report in the video below:\n\n02:46\n\n5:40pm: White House vows response if Russia attacks US satellites\n\nAny attacks on US infrastructure will be met with a response, the White House said Thursday after a senior Russian foreign ministry official said Western commercial satellites could become legitimate targets for Russia if they were involved in the war in Ukraine.\n\nKonstantin Vorontsov, a deputy head of the Russian delegation at a United Nations arms control panel, said in remarks delivered Wednesday that the use of US and other Western commercial satellites for military purposes during the fighting in Ukraine is \"extremely dangerous\" and effectively means their involvement in the conflict. Vorontsov warned that \"the quasi-civilian infrastructure could be a legitimate target for a retaliatory strike\".\n\nWhite House spokesman John Kirby responded by saying such action would be responded to and added that publicly available information shows Russians have been trying to pursue anti-satellite technologies.\n\n5:12pm: Putin says West using Ukraine to claim global domination\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday sought to cast the conflict in Ukraine as part of efforts by the West to secure its global domination. The West is playing a \"dangerous and bloody\" game, he said.\n\nPutin, who sent his troops into Ukraine on February 24, has cast Western support for Ukraine as part of broad efforts by Washington and its allies to enforce what they call a rules-based world order that only foments chaos. The Russian leader warned that \"he who will sow the wind will reap the whirlwind.\"\n\n\"Ahead is probably the most dangerous, unpredictable and at the same time important decade since the end of the Second World War.\"\n\n4:36pm: Russia amends law to allow for ex-convicts to fight in Ukraine\n\nThe Russian parliament on Thursday passed a law allowing ex-convicts to be mobilised into the army and other measures to prop up Moscows troops in Ukraine. The recruitment of people released from prison but who hold a criminal record for serious crimes was previously banned from joining the Russian armed forces.\n\nThe change does not apply to people convicted of sexual assault against a minor, terrorist acts, traffic of radioactive material or crimes against the government, including treason and espionage.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have joined the Russian armed forces since mobilisation was announced, the defence ministry said in early October. But after some public outrage over students, older or sick people being mistakenly ordered to report for duty, Vladimir Putin ordered that mistakes be \"corrected\".\n\n3:12pm: Ukraine accuses Russia of planning to stage 'false flag' attack at nuclear plant\n\nGen. Oleksii Gromov, the chief of the main operational department of the Ukrainian militarys General Staff, has accused Russia of planning to stage explosions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and blame them on Ukraine in a 'false flag' attack.\n\nRussia took control of the Zaporizhzhia plant in the opening days of the invasion. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of attacking the plant, which has been shut after continuous shelling.\n\nMoscow has in the past week made the unfounded claim that Ukraine is preparing to use a \"dirty bomb,\" an explosive devise with radioactive material, on its own territory. Western officials have dismissed the claim as misinformation possibly designed as a pretext for Russia to justify its own military escalation.\n\n1:26pm: Ukraine withdrew from talks with Moscow on US 'order', says Kremlin\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Ukraine pulled out of peace talks with Moscow in March on an \"order\" from the United States, the Kremlin said Thursday.\n\n\"The text was ready... And then suddenly the Ukrainian side went off the radar, the Ukrainian side declared its unwillingness to continue negotiations,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that Putin considered it \"obvious\" that the decision to stop talks \"occurred on an order from Washington\".\n\n1:21pm: Authorities in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia order phone checks on residents\n\nRussian-installed authorities in Ukraine's occupied region of Zaporizhzhia ordered phone checks on local residents on Thursday, announcing the implementation of military censorship under Russian President Vladimir Putin's martial law decree.\n\n\"From today in the Zaporizhzhia region, law enforcement officers have begun a selective preventing check of the mobile phones of citizens,\" Moscow-appointed official Vladimir Rogov said.\n\nHe said those subscribed to \"propaganda resources of the terrorist Kyiv regime\" will receive a warning, before being fined. He also warned that there will be \"criminal liability\" for \"malicious violations of a law on the activities of foreign agents\".\n\n11:49am: Kherson will be 'the most consequential battle of the war so far'\n\nFRANCE 24s chief foreign editor Rob Parsons details how Ukraine expects fighting to intensify over the next few weeks and that Kherson will be \"the most consequential battle of the war so far\". If Ukraine manages to retake Kherson by the end of the year, it would signify \"a massive turnaround, both strategically and in terms of morale\". On the other hand, Ukraine's \"progress is much more incremental than it has been\" because of heavy rain, which is typical for this time of year, and makes parts of the underdeveloped road network harder to navigate for heavy equipment.\n\n02:22\n\n10:52am: Ukraine boosts forces near Belarus in case of attack\n\nUkraine has boosted its forces in the northern region near Belarus to counter any possible renewed Russian attack across the border, Ukraine's General Staff said on Thursday.\n\n\"At the current time the creation of a strike force (in Belarus) is not observable. (But) there are and will be threats. We are reacting, we have already increased our troops in the northern direction,\" Oleksii Hromov, deputy head of the General Staff's Main Operations Directorate, told a regular briefing.\n\nBelarus is Russia's main ally in the conflict and has allowed Russian forces to use its territory as a springboard to attack Ukraine.\n\n9:47am: Russia hit power grid in central regions of Ukraine overnight\n\nRussian forces struck the power grid in central regions of Ukraine overnight and further electricity supply restrictions are possible, grid operator Ukrenergo said on Thursday.\n\n\"Equipment at the major network of the Ukrainian energy system in the central regions was damaged,\" it said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nRussia has stepped up its strikes on crucial Ukrainian infrastructure including the power grid in recent weeks, leaving millions without electricity or heating for lengthy periods of time as winter approaches.\n\n9:05am: Crimea power plant hit by drone attack, say Moscow-backed authorities\n\nAuthorities in Moscow-annexed Crimea said Thursday that a thermal power plant on the peninsula was targeted by an overnight drone attack, but claimed it was not badly damaged.\n\n\"Today at night there was a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack on the Balaklava thermal power station,\" the Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said on Telegram. \"The transformer is minimally damaged. There were no casualties,\" he added.\n\nThe official said there was \"no threat to power supply\" and that \"the incident does not affect the power supply of Sevastopol and the peninsula.\"\n\n8:25am: Kyiv prepares to launch counter-offensive on Kherson\n\nKyiv has deployed thousands of soldiers to Kherson as it plans to encircle the regions capital and launch a counter-offensive there. The objective is to reclaim Kherson, which Russia took at the start of the war, before winter arrives.\n\nFRANCE 24s Jonathan Walsh, Amar al Hameedawi and Jean-Emile Jammine report from the front line.\n\n01:52 Kyiv has deployed thousands of soldiers to the Kherson region during its counter-offensive to retake the region before winter. screengrab FRANCE 24\n\n6:00am: Energy crisis sparked by Ukraine war to speed up green transition, says IEA\n\nThe drop in Russian fossil fuel exports after its Ukraine invasion this year will transform the global energy landscape for decades and can help to hasten a green energy transition, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.\n\nThe IEA's annual World Energy Outlook acknowledges the economic hit from reduced supplies of Russian oil, natural gas and coal but is keeping an environmental best case scenario in which no investment in new fossil fuel projects is needed.\n\nThe IEA's report said the global energy crisis is causing profound and long-lasting changes that could hasten the transition to a more sustainable and secure energy system.\n\n5:31am: UN optimistic on Ukraine grain deal; Russia has reservations\n\nA senior UN official said Wednesday he is \"relatively optimistic\" the deal for returning Ukrainian grain and Russian grain and fertiliser to world markets will be extended beyond mid-November, but Russias UN ambassador said Moscow needs to see movement on its own exports first.\n\nThe deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July has led to more than 8.5 million metric tons of foodstuffs being shipped from three Black Sea ports in Ukraine.\n\nBut Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzia told reporters that \"Russia needs to see the export of its grain and fertilizers in the world market, which has never happened since the beginning of the deal.\"\n\nRead more analysis on the war in Ukraine France Mdias Monde graphic studio\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AP, AFP and REUTERS)\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

Ukraines foreign ministry has condemned the decree as a \"new state of terror\" aimed to \"to suppress the resistance\" of those regions residents.\n\nRussian-installed leaders in Kherson region earlier Wednesday began massively ramping up the relocation of up to 60,000 people amid warnings over Russias ability to withstand a Ukrainian counter-offensive.\n\nPutin nonetheless said he would impose the policy during a scheduled Russian Security Council meeting. Martial law will come into effect in those regions on Thursday, his decree stated.\n\n\"In this regard, let me remind you that in the Donetsk Peoples Republic, the Luhansk Peoples Republic, as well as in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, martial law was in effect before joining Russia,\" Putin said during a televised address.\n\n\"Now we need to formalize this regime within the framework of Russian legislation,\" he said.\n\n\"Therefore, I signed a decree on the introduction of martial law in these four subjects of the Russian Federation, so it will be immediately sent to the Federation Council,\" Putin said.\n\nBut when it comes to Putins decrees, its always worth reading the fine print. Wednesdays order appears to leave scope for the introduction of additional restrictions throughout Russia. Paragraph three of the martial law order states, \"If necessary, other measures provided for by the Federal Constitutional Law of January 30, 2002 No. 1-FKZ on martial law may be applied in the Russian Federation during the period of martial law.\"\n\nIts not yet entirely clear what Wednesdays orders mean for the mass of ordinary Russians. Rumors about the introduction of martial law have circulated since the February 24 invasion of Ukraine. But if the past months are any guide, the measures are part of a slow-motion tightening of control over Russian society that began with the crushing of independent media and continued with the introduction of partial mobilization.\n\nThe decree on the regions imposes a series of alert levels in Russian regions. In the annexed region of Crimea and Crimea and in Krasnodar Territory, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, Rostov regions, authorities will introduce a \"medium alert level\" that will restrict movement and transportation and makes provision for the \"temporary resettlement of residents to safe areas,\" without providing further specifics about the populations that might need to move.\n\nMoscow is also not untouched. The decree on regions also puts regions of Russias Southern federal okrug and the Central federal okrug which includes the capital and its environs on an \"elevated\" footing. How this hits home with Moscows residents, some of whom are already rattled by Putins partial mobilization, will be something to watch.\n\nRussias Federation Council will consider Putins decree on martial law in the regions as soon as possible, said Andrei Klishas, chairman of the Federation Council committee on constitutional legislation, in a statement on his Telegram channel.",

Residents, many with small children, could be seen crowding the river's banks, crossing to the east.\n\nThe mass evacuation of civilians from one of the first major cities Russia seized in the invasion of Ukraine is a tacit acknowledgement that yet another stinging battlefield defeat may be unfolding for Putin. It's also the biggest population centre Moscow has seized and held since its \"special military operation\" began Feb. 24. The city is on territory that Putin says is now formally incorporated into Russia, a move Ukraine and the West do not recognize.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the local Russia-backed administration, made a video appeal after Russian forces in the area were driven back by 20 to 30 kilometres in the last few weeks. They risk being pinned against the western bank of the 2,200-kilometre-long river. The region's Moscow-installed administrators now appear to be hoping that the Dnipro's wide, deep waters will act as a natural barrier against those approaching forces.\n\nMoscow-backed authorities have said evacuations from occupied territories are voluntary. But in many cases, the only routes out are to Russia.\n\nOne resident reached by phone described columns of military vehicles leaving the city, Moscow-installed authorities scrambling to load documents onto trucks, and thousands of people lining up for ferries and buses.\n\n\"It looks more like a panic rather than an organized evacuation. People are buying the last remaining groceries in grocery shops and are running to the Kherson river port, where thousands of people are already waiting,\" the resident, Konstantin, said. The Associated Press is withholding his family name, as he requested, for his safety.\n\nMartial law\n\nIn a move that looked designed to help Russia firm its grip on four Ukrainian regions it partly occupies and seeks to fully control including the Kherson region Putin told his Security Council he was introducing martial law in them. He also gave emergency extra powers to the heads of Russian regions and issued a decree restricting movement in and out of eight regions adjoining Ukraine.\n\nPutin didn't immediately spell out the powers that martial law would grant. But they could include restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader powers for law enforcement agencies.\n\nPutin's order also opens the door for restrictive measures to be extended across Russia. That may lead to an even tougher crackdown on dissent in Russia, where authorities have quickly dispersed anti-war protests and jailed many under new legislation that criminalizes any statements or information about the fighting that differs from the official line.\n\nU.S., Ukraine dismiss Putin's move\n\nKyiv derided the move.\n\n\"This does not change anything for Ukraine: we continue the liberation and de-occupation of our territories,\" presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said Putin had found himself in a difficult position and his only tool was to brutalize Ukrainian civilians. The U.S. State Department said it was no surprise that Russia was resorting to \"desperate tactics.\"\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman checks the trenches dug by Russian soldiers in a retaken area in Kherson region, Ukraine, on Wednesday. The city of the same name promises to be a key battleground. (Leo Correa/The Associated Press)\n\nSeveral Ukrainian soldiers said they were aware of the martial law declaration but were not worried, although they warned a visiting Reuters reporter of the danger presented by Russian drones.\n\n\"For sure [Putin's] up to no good. We understand that,\" said Yaroslav, who declined to give his last name. \"But whatever they are doing, we will screw them anyway.\"\n\nOleh, who also withheld his last name, said Russia in the past had warned about what it claimed would be escalatory Ukrainian actions, only to carry them out itself.\n\n\"We are just concerned about our people in the Kherson region,\" he said.\n\nA woman looks at posters honouring Russian service members, including those participating in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, at the Muzeon park in Moscow on Wednesday. (Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMoscow denies deliberately targeting civilians, though the conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions, pulverized Ukrainian cities, shaken the global economy and reopened Cold War-era geopolitical fissures.\n\nThe Russian-installed chief of Kherson region said about 50,000 to 60,000 people would be evacuated from the region in the next six days. The city of Kherson had a pre-war population of around 280,000 people but many of them have since fled.\n\nRussian commander with gloomy assessment of Kherson\n\nThe evacuation calls followed a gloomy assessment of Russia's prospects in the area from Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the new commander of Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\n\"The situation in the area of the special military operation can be described as tense,\" Surovikin told state-owned Rossiya 24 news channel. \"The situation in [Kherson] is difficult. The enemy is deliberately striking infrastructure and residential buildings.\"\n\nRussian bloggers have interpreted Surovikin's comments as a warning of a possible pullback of Moscow's forces.\n\nGen. Sergei Surovikin describes the situation for Russian forces in the Kherson region as 'very difficult.' (Russian Defence Ministry Press Service/The Associated Press)\n\nUkrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the operation could be a precursor for intense fighting and \"the harshest\" tactics from Surovikin.\n\n\"They are prepared to wipe the city from the face of the Earth but not give it back to the Ukrainians,\" Zhdanov said in an interview. \"The Russians want to show that Ukraine's counteroffensive will run into a harsh response from the Kremlin, which has declared these territories a part of Russia, and it's scary to even think about what that response might look like.\"\n\nAfter being routed from around the capital, Kyiv, and then pushed back in the south and east by the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive launched in late summer, with the backing of Western-supplied weaponry, Moscow is now increasingly resorting to targeting Ukraine's power plants and other energy infrastructure, threatening a miserable winter for millions of Ukrainians.\n\nZelenskyy urges power rationing\n\nZelenskyy urged Ukrainians to make \"a very conscious\" effort to save power, speaking before another night where substations and other infrastructure were pounded.\n\nUkraine will start restricting electricity supplies across the country on Thursday, an aide to Zelenskyy said Wednesday.\n\n\"From 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., it is necessary to minimize the use of electricity. If this is not done, you should prepare for temporary blackouts,\" Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Zelenskyy's office, said in a Telegram post.\n\nBernard, a volunteer from Sweden, holds a wood stove before placing it into a van in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, and delivering it to front-line villages on Oct. 18.

It said Russian forces attacked nine southeastern regions of Ukraine using drones, rockets and heavy artillery, focusing on energy facilities.\n\nIn other news related to the war, the people of Ukraine and their representatives were awarded the European Union's top human rights prize Wednesday for their resistance to Russia's invasion.\n\nThe award, named for Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, was created in 1988 to honour individuals or groups who defend human rights and fundamental freedoms. Sakharov, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, died in 1989.\n\nIt's the second straight year EU lawmakers used the Sakharov Prize to send a message to the Kremlin. Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny won it last year.",

Credit... Emile Ducke for The New York Times\n\nRIGA, Latvia Russia is massing thousands of troops in its western neighbor Belarus ahead of what could be the opening of a new front aimed at disrupting the flow of Western military aid from Poland, according to defense officials in Latvia and Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the assembled forces, about 10,000 troops, may still be too weak to make a successful new thrust south from Belarus, Latvias defense minister, Artis Pabriks, said on Friday.\n\n\"We have to be cautious, but I doubt that Russians are at this moment capable of opening another front line against Ukraine, at least not a successful front,\" Mr. Pabriks said in an interview in Riga, the capital of Latvia, which borders both Russia and Belarus.\n\nAn announcement last week by Belarus that it was forming a new joint military force with Russia stirred alarm in the West that the Kremlin might be preparing a new ground assault with help from Belarusian forces. Russia massed troops in Belarus ahead of its initial attack on Ukraine in February.\n\nOn Thursday, a Ukrainian general, Oleksiy Gromov, said that the threat of a possible invasion from Belarus was growing. He said that a new attack would likely not drive toward Kyiv which lies just 60 miles from the border with Belarus but rather to the west of the capital, nearer to the Polish border. An offensive south from western Belarus into Ukrainian territory near the border with Poland could disrupt the flow of weapons to Ukraine from the United States and its allies, much of which passes through Poland.\n\nThe military officials in Riga and Kyiv did not say precisely where the Russian troops were gathering, nor why they believed a new offensive could occur closer to Poland than to Kyiv.\n\nRussia used the territory of Belarus, its closest military and political ally, as a staging ground for its February invasion and has since launched missiles and drones into Ukraine from there. But President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Belaruss veteran strongman leader, has resisted Russias pressure to get directly involved in the war.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Lukashenko said it would be undesirable for Belarusian military equipment to be used in Ukraine and denied his countrys troops were training for war, adding \"no war today. We dont need it,\" the state news agency Belta reported.\n\nMr. Lukashenko made a similar statement in February, just days before Russia invaded Ukraine from his territory.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraines armed forces said in a statement that if the country were attacked again from Belarus, it would \"respond as fiercely as we respond to all occupiers.\" A new front in the north would inevitably pull Ukrainian forces away from the south and east, where they have launched offensives to take back land Russia captured early in the war.\n\nThe flurry of military activity in Belarus in recent days, Britains defense ministry said on Friday, is \"likely an attempt to demonstrate Russian-Belarusian solidarity and to convince Ukraine to divert forces to guard the northern border.\"\n\nNoting claims by Mr. Lukashenko that 70,000 Belarusians and 15,000 Russians would be involved in their new joint force, Britains defense ministry said it was unlikely that Russia had actually deployed significant forces and added that Belarus \"maintains minimal capability to undertake complex operations.\"\n\nVadym Skibitsky, a spokesman for Ukraines military intelligence agency, said in an interview that Ukraine also did not see an immediate threat of another attack from Belarus.\n\nSeveral thousand newly mobilized Russian soldiers are deployed in Belarus at training sites, Mr. Skibitsky said, but they are not accompanied by tanks, artillery or fuel trucks and other logistical support they would need to invade and face Ukraines battle-hardened troops.\n\n\"We see these elements now moving into Belarus, but we do not see the movement of equipment,\" he said.\n\nBrig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, also played down the likelihood of a new Russian invasion from Belarus. \"We dont currently have any indications of a potential imminent military action on that front,\" he told a briefing on Thursday.\n\nAndrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.",

                "cc_text": "On Thursday, the Pentagon released its long-awaited 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), along with the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) and Missile Defense Review (MDR). Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrote in the strategys introduction that it will shape the departments priorities during the coming \"decisive decadefrom helping to protect the American people, to promoting global security, to seizing new strategic opportunities, and to realizing and defending our democratic values.\" Does the strategy succeed? Does it adequately address Russian aggression in Ukraine and the multifaceted challenges from China? Whats missing?\n\nWe asked experts from across the Atlantic Councilmany of whom worked to develop these documents during their time in governmentto break down the highs and lows of the strategies and pull out the key things you need to know.\n\n1. The NDS undersells the threat from Russia to the US\n\nThe 2022 NDS categorizes the threat from the Russian government as \"acute,\" encompassing the immediacy of the threat and the targeted nature of the current operational environment. This distinction from the \"pacing\" and \"strategic competition\" threat posed by the Peoples Republic of China represents a shift from the Defense Departments threat priorities from the 2018 NDS, putting Russia as the clear number-two priority. Though delays to the NDS release are reportedly connected with the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the Department in fact chose to deemphasize the detrimental impact Russian actions have on US national security.\n\nWhile the NDS gives the Russian threat credibility and addresses the need for prompt action, assistance, support, and strong cooperation with partners and allies, it describes the Russian threat as localized and predominantly asymmetric in nature. This threat description poses a precarious balance for the Department. Though Russia has recently demonstrated embarrassing performances on the battlefield, the second-tier ranking of the Russian threat in the NDS must not deter vigilance against the global chaos Russia sows. Russia does not use the Western playbook of rules or principles to dictate its direction, and the United States would be wise not to apply Western thought processes and decisionmaking to an authoritarian and fearful government that has thrown caution and pragmatism to the wind.\n\nYou only need to look at some of the Russian malign actions and tactics since Februarysubversive energy policy, economic warfare, food-supply threats, misinformation, nuclear threats, and sabotage. Many of these actions have worldwide reach with no signs of slowing. Meanwhile, Russia continues to back itself into a corner of its own making, growing its reliance on its pernicious partnerswhich the NDS also identifies as threatsChina, North Korea, and Iran to support its malicious foreign policy goals. And though this isolation is of Russias own making, the United States should not interpret its failures to mean that Russia cannot bring tumult and instability in the near, medium, and long term. The NDS correctly highlights the threats Russia poses, but decisionmakers must not fall into the trap of assuming current Russian embarrassments as foregone conclusions. The United States must address all of the subversive and dangerous ways Russia can pose a threat to its security.\n\nCatherine Sendak is a nonresident senior fellow in the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Securitys Transatlantic Security Initiative and former principal director for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy.\n\n2. Tough talk on China will provoke a response from Beijing\n\nThe biggest takeaway for me is the strategys new focus on homeland defense challenges posed by Russia and China, rather than military contingencies in the Indo-Pacific or Europe, an emphasis that touches domestic political vulnerabilities in addition to those of the military and core infrastructure. Combined with the emphasis on \"Campaigning,\" it sends a strong message that the world is actively contested now, and that the Department of Defense (DOD) and all of the US government is not just preparing for potential kinetic conflict, but engaged already in active contestation focused on China, and secondarily Russia.\n\nThe big question now is how China will read this and whether it will deter or spur them to accelerate their own, already massive military and technological transformation. The NDSs focus on \"Campaigning\" will signal that DOD and other US departments are already conducting operations to disadvantage Chinatantamount to a new Cold War. The era of DOD claiming that its activitiesfreedom of navigation operations, reconnaissance flights, multilateral exercisesare merely \"things we have always done\" is over. This will incentivize Chinese responses, especially with US allies and partners in the region, including pointed exercises by the Peoples Liberation Army. Moreover, the NDSs emphasis on integrated support and operations with allies and partners will underscore the threat to China of US designation of Taiwan as a \"key non-NATO ally,\" potentially breaking existing US policy barriers to a virtual defense guarantee.\n\nJohn K. Culver is a nonresident senior fellow at the Global China Hub and former US national intelligence officer for East Asia.\n\n3. The \"integrated deterrence\" approach needs clearer lines between DOD and DHS\n\nHow will DOD work with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to protect the United States from non-military attack under the NDSs \"integrated deterrence\" approach? Non-military security is an increasingly important issue that the NDS addresses, but at key points the NDS paints only a few dotted lines in the road without clearly stating where the lanes will be. When the country is engaged in military conflict, DOD is the \"supported\" department, and other departments and agencies are \"supporting\" DOD and the defense industrial base in fighting and winning the United States wars. But the NDS is less precise about when, and to what extent, DOD will be the \"supporting\" command to departments like DHS in defending civilian infrastructure such as the financial sector, pipelines, water systems, and electrical grids. Make no mistake: DOD needs these civilian sectors functioning to meet the military threats that the NDS addresses.\n\nSecurity challenges in the coming years will increasingly be campaigns waged against the American people using non-military means. China, Russia, and Iran have all adopted hybrid warfare strategies against the United States and its allies. As part of Russias kinetic war against Ukraine, Russia is simultaneously waging information warfare to divide and weaken the American people. Russias campaign against Europe over natural gas supplies this winter is already underway. In 2013, then General James Mattis testified that if Congress did not fund the State Department, \"then I need to buy more ammunition.\" A similar warning needs to be issued today about funding US civilian efforts in cybersecurity and other missionsfor which DHS, rather than DOD, will need to be the supported command.\n\nThomas Warrick is a senior fellow at the Scowcroft Centers Forward Defense practice and director of the Atlantic Councils Future of DHS Project. He is a former DHS deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism policy.\n\n4. Inside a revealing battle of the buzzwords\n\nThe 2022 NDS is about relationshipsrelationships between the United States and its top two adversaries, complex relationships between compounding threats across all domains, and relationships between the United States and its allies and partners. These relationships are complicated. Managing escalation is key in the new strategy, as the threat of unintended escalation is greater now as the United States faces increased aggression by Russia and China and grapples with the unknown ways that new technologies could complicate pathways for escalation, especially in the space and cyber domains where pre-established norms are lacking. These more complicated relationships have led DOD to adopt \"integrated deterrence.\" Integrated deterrence is extremely complicated, but it at least is better defined than \"deterrence\" in the 2018 NDS, which did not articulate enough the specific activities in specific domains that the strategy was aiming to deter. From this logic of integrating deterrence against increasingly complicated threats, you can better understand why the NDS has downgraded Russia from a great-power competitor to an \"acute threat,\" even if you dont agree with it.\n\nThese security strategies are a battle of buzzwords, and I would say the buzzwords in the 2022 NDS have surprised me. The biggest surprise is the return of A2/AD: anti-access/area-denial. Russia and China seek to create A2/AD environments that undermine US conventional and nuclear force advantages and collective responses with allies, and a key way to overcome this, according to the NDS, is by developing concepts and capabilities that can \"penetrate adversaries at range.\" But missing from the NDS is the much-buzzed-about concept of joint all domain command and control (JADC2) or multi-domain operations (MDO), which seems strange on the same day that a new JADC2 office is opened in the Pentagon, which could also help overcome adversary A2/AD advantages.\n\nSecondly, this NDS also does away with many of the key phrases from the 2018 strategy, such as the \"global operating model\" and \"dynamic force employment\" (which my colleagues took a stab at clarifying last year), but then seems to encompass them in an overall new buzzword: campaigning. But it lacks specifics in how the United States will enable deterrence by denial and overcome A2/AD challenges without an increased and sustained presence in Europe, which is never directly addressed. Beyond concepts, another key buzzword in the NDS is \"resilience,\" which is mentioned in some form over thirty times and in more nuanced ways that include resilience against climate change and resilience in the face of degraded operating environments caused by adversary A2/AD threats. Overall, there are some welcome changes and a lot more work to further define and implement them.\n\nLeah Scheunemann is the deputy director of the Scowcroft Centers Transatlantic Security Initiative and former special assistant to the US undersecretary of defense for policy, overseeing matters related to international security.\n\n5. The focus on integrated deterrence, and the gray zones role in it, is long overdue\n\nThe NDS offered a much-needed discussion about integrated deterrence, and while the national-security community has its work cut out in implementation, that discussion over how to effectively use all existing and new \"tools at the Departments disposal\" to maintain the strategic advantage was also a decade overdue.\n\nIn the NDS, Austin further expanded on the elements of integrated deterrence from US President Joe Bidens National Security Strategy. It was heartening to see that the gray zone was explicitly noted as part of the security environment on the topic of strategic competitors and adversaries and that it was also indirectly highlighted from an offensive or deterrent perspective through imposing costs, leveraging the information domain, and managing escalation. In the context of campaigning to sustain military advantages, the NDS explicitly called out \"[addressing] gray zone challenges\" as an objective.\n\nTo truly and effectively integrate deterrence, the United States must avoid tunnel vision in developing conventional general-purpose and strategic deterrent forces. Such forces are a competitive advantage, and must continue to remain so, particularly in the eyes of competitors and adversaries. A credible conventional and strategic deterrent underwrites all other US and allied elements of statecraft. But integrated deterrence also means placing as much emphasis on the things that do not necessarily go \"boom,\" making good use of the maneuver room enabled by the deterrents. Defending against gray-zone operations activities and actions, while effectively using the countrys own, will be key to this. Allied perceptions of US reliability as a partner will also continue to be critical to integrated deterrence and must reinforce that the United States can always be relied upon to defend and support its friends, regardless of domestic political winds.\n\nArun Iyer is a nonresident senior fellow at the Scowcroft Center and leads its project \"Adding Color to the Gray Zone.\" He served in a variety of operational and operational leadership assignments in the US Department of Defense.\n\n6. The NDSs priorities are correct, but it may have taken on too much\n\nThis strategy should be heralded for its clear articulation of threats: It rightly places China at the top in the hierarchy of strategic challenges facing the United States, as the \"pacing\" threat. This is a departure from the 2018 NDS, which categorized Russia and China somewhat similarly. Russia is an \"acute\" challengean immediate and fierce threatbut not an all-domain challenge in the way China is. The strategy emphasizes the need to build \"enduring advantages\" to modernize and build up the Joint Force, and it integrates strategic deterrence concepts with conventional deterrence. Highlighting the compounding challenges to escalation dynamics from emerging technology and in domains like cyber and space is a worthy focus area.\n\nThat said, the NDS may have taken on too muchand it falls down in a few areas. First, the three strategic ways outlined in the NDS are still not clearly defined and could lead to confusion. \"Integrated deterrence\" is defined around altering adversary perceptions of risk, but if the types of malign behavior that the United States is trying to deter are not broadly understood across the Defense Department, this will be hard to achieve. Second, collaboration with US allies and partners is rightly emphasized throughout as a \"strategic advantage,\" yet integration with allies will require enhanced operational and strategic planning that is hindered by current barriers to information sharing and technological cooperation. Third, to compete with Chinas advances in artificial intelligence, undersea capabilities, quantum computing, and directed energy, the United States needs to absorb technological innovation more rapidly from the leading edge of the private sector than it does today. The NDS talks about working across the defense industrial base to sharpen the Joint Forces \"technological edge,\" but theres scant detail on how cultural and process roadblocks will be adapted to enable better engagement with the private sector and adoption at speed.\n\nThe NDS provides a solid vision, but it will take substantial resources to implementa difficult task given the multitude of investments outlined in the strategy and the fiscal constraints on the Pentagon. Responding to immediate concerns from Russia in Europe along with long-term competition with China will require the administration to make trade-offs. The ultimate success of this strategy relies on how well those trade-offs are managed in its implementation.\n\nClementine G. Starling is the deputy director of the Scowcroft Centers Forward Defense practice.\n\n7. While the nuclear landscape has changed, the NPR continues the status quo\n\nWith its new NPR, the Biden administration takes into account todays strategic realities and follows a well-carved path prioritizing nuclear deterrence. The nuclear landscape has changed with the United States now confronting not one but two nuclear powersRussia and Chinaboth of whom are expanding and modernizing their arsenals. These nuclear developments are happening alongside a return to more traditional great-power politics, on display with extreme clarity in the war in Ukraine. For these reasons, the NPR emphasizes the United States leadership in the nuclear environment, including recommitting to a \"safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent;\" placing pride of place in alliance partnerships and regional security architectures; modernizing the nuclear infrastructure and related systems; and rededicating US efforts to \"arms control, non-proliferation and risk reduction.\"\n\nDespite earlier indications on the campaign trail and elsewhere that the Biden administration (like the Obama administration) would attempt a significant shift in US nuclear weapons policy including adopting No First Use and Sole Purpose policiesthe possibility has now been shelved. Both policies remain hotly contested in the United States and in ally countries under the nuclear umbrella, and it is unsurprising that the administration views the present security environment as not conducive to a dramatic reorientation.\n\nWhile the NPR does remove \"hedging against an uncertain future\" as a stated role for nuclear weapons from the United States description of its role for nuclear weapons, and cancels the sea-launched cruise missile program, it also retains the W76-2 low-yield submarine-launched warhead introduced in the Trump administration. Taken holistically, critics of nuclear deterrence and advocates of global zero will likely be disheartened by an NPR that reads largely as a status quo continuation of long-standing nuclear policy attuned to the current strategic challenges facing the United States.\n\nRachel Whitlark is a nonresident senior fellow in the Scowcroft Centers Forward Defense practice and an associate professor at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\n8. A subtle policy shift on nuclear weapons offers a measured response to Putin\n\nDespite Bidens campaign trail pledges to reduce the role of nuclear weapons, this NPR responds to the reality of the current security environment. With many nods to the 2018 NPR, three things will likely stand out to most readersthe administrations shift to a \"fundamental purpose\" declaratory policy, the removal of \"hedging against an uncertain future\" as a role for nuclear weapons, and the elimination of the Nuclear Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM-N), a system initially identified in the 2018 NPR as a \"needed non-strategic regional presence\" and \"an assured response capability\" meant to deter and respond to limited nuclear attack.\n\nThough seemingly inconsequential, this shift to a fundamental purpose statement and the elimination of the SLCM-N suggests a larger change in the administrations thinking about the role of nuclear weaponsnamely, that some in the Biden administration believe that escalation dynamics surrounding nuclear weapons cannot be controlled. In many ways, the change in this strategywhich was delayed due to Russias unprovoked invasion of Ukraineshows a measured response to months of nuclear-saber rattling from Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is a stark reminder that a nuclear strike would, in the words of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, have \"catastrophic consequences,\" and though the NDS as a whole is shaped around China as a future adversary, this NPR was clearly crafted with Russias limited nuclear threats in mind.\n\nThe core tension in the document lies in its desire to avoid the use of nuclear weapons except in extreme circumstances while also maintaining a credible deterrent against adversarial nuclear use. While the most obvious way to deter an adversarys nuclear use is to be prepared to use nuclear weapons oneself, this NPRs elimination of the SLCM-N shows that this administration may be intending to rely more heavily on conventional means to deter and respond to limited nuclear attack, given that the SLCM-N was conceived explicitly as an answer to non-strategic nuclear systemsotherwise known as \"tactical\" nuclear weapons. The emphasis on the synchronization of nuclear and non-nuclear planning and operations further indicates that the administration may believe that conventional rather than nuclear weapons might provide an adequate response to a limited nuclear strike, and while that might be true with the right set of precision-guided conventional weapons, there is some tension between such a response and the implied taboo of nuclear use. Even as it struggles with this tension, though, the 2022 NPR nevertheless gives a mature treatment of the risks of this coming, tripolar nuclear environment in which the United States will for the first time face two nuclear powers at once as strategic competitors.\n\nAlyxandra Marine is a program assistant in the Scowcroft Centers Forward Defense practice.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRelated Experts: Catherine Sendak, John K.

It will mean the military and local administrations will have the right to do what they want in terms of how people move around, or restrict them from gathering,\" he said.\n\n\"Political parties gathering and activities will be banned, and civilian or semi-civilian factories will be asked to reorient their production lines to help the military.\n\n\"The mobilisation in those regions will now be a total mobilisation instead of partial mobilisation, which has taken place in the Russian Federation,\" he added.\n\nTighter security in Russian regions\n\nPutin also gave additional emergency powers to the heads of all regions of Russia. The government was instructed to set up a special Coordination Committee under Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to work with Russias regions to boost Moscows war effort in Ukraine.\n\nRussian state agency TASS reported that the decree would be sent for approval to the Federation Council the upper house of Russias parliament and that the lower house State Duma would be informed of the decision.\n\nPutin did not provide details of the extra powers to be given to the heads of Russian regions under his decree, but said the order would be effective from Thursday.\n\nDraft legislation indicates it may involve restrictions on travel and public gatherings, tighter censorship and broader authority for law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe annexation of the four partially occupied regions on September 30 came three days after the completion of Kremlin-orchestrated \"referendums\", which are largely regarded as having no validity by the international community.\n\nDespite the formal announcement, Russia is losing ground by the day to Kyivs counteroffensive. In Kherson, one of the four occupied regions, Moscow made plans this week to evacuate civilians.\n\nSergei Surovikin, a Russian air force general appointed on October 10 to lead the invasion, admitted that the situation was \"very difficult\".\n\nThe \"enemy is not abandoning its attempts to attack Russian troop positions,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nKherson is arguably the most strategically important of the four regions as it contains both the only land route to the occupied Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized in 2014, and the mouth of the Dnieper River.\n\nSurovikin has been nicknamed \"General Armageddon\" in Russian media after serving in Syria and Chechnya, where his forces pounded cities to rubble.\n\nHis appointment was followed by the biggest wave of missile attacks against Ukraine since the start of the war.",

                "cc_text": "KYIV, Ukraine -\n\nRussian and Ukrainian troops appeared Thursday to be girding for a major battle over the strategic southern industrial port city of Kherson, in a region which Russian President Vladimir Putin has illegally annexed and subjected to martial law.\n\nFighting and evacuations were reported in the Kherson region as Moscow tried to pound the invaded country into submission with more missile and drone attacks on critical infrastructure.\n\nPutin declared martial law in the Kherson, Luhansk, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions on Wednesday in an attempt to assert Russian authority in the annexed areas as he faced battlefield setbacks, a troubled troop mobilization, increasing criticism at home and abroad, and international sanctions.\n\nThe unsettled status of the illegally absorbed territory was especially visible in the Kherson region's capital, where Russian military officials have replaced Kremlin-installed civilian leaders as part of martial law that took effect Thursday to defend against a Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nKherson city, with a prewar population of about 284,000, was one of the first urban areas Russia captured when it invaded Ukraine, and it remains the largest city it holds. It is a prime target for both sides because of its key industries and major river port. Reports of sabotage and assassinations of Russian-installed officials in Kherson have surfaced for months, in what appeared to be one of the most active Ukrainian resistance movements in occupied territory.\n\nRussian-installed officials have urged residents to evacuate for their safety and to allow the military to build fortifications. Officials said 15,000 residents of an expected 60,000 had been relocated from the city and surrounding areas as of Thursday.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said Thursday that Ukrainian forces mounted 15 attacks on Russian military strongholds in the Kherson region. For its part, Russia's Defense Ministry spokesman said the Kremlin's forces repelled Ukrainian attempts to advance with tanks on the Kherson villages of Sukhanove, Nova Kamianka and Chervonyi Yar.\n\nA Russian-installed official in the region, Vladimir Leontyev, said Thursday Ukrainian forces had launched five missile strikes against the Kakhovka dam and hydroelectric power station about 70 kms (44 miles) from Kherson city. He said on Russian TV that if the facilities were destroyed, a critical canal providing water to annexed Crimea would be cut off.\n\nZelenskyy countered that the Russians have mined the dam and power station, with plans to blow them up in what he called a terrorism act to unleash 18 million cubic meters (4.8 billion gallons) and flood Kherson and dozens of areas where hundreds of thousands of people live. He told the European Council Russia would then blame Ukraine.\n\nNone of the claims could be independently verified.\n\nRussia's new military commander in Ukraine this week acknowledged the threat posed by Ukraine's counteroffensive to Kherson, and Britain's Defense Ministry interpreted that Thursday to mean, \"Russian authorities are seriously considering a major withdrawal of their forces from the area west of the Dnieper River.\"\n\nPutin tried Thursday to address another problem area, the partial mobilization of reservists he ordered last month and estimated it would end by the end of this month by reaching its 300,000-man target. He visited a training center in the Russian region of Ryazan to show progress in rectifying problems with training and supplies for newly mobilized troops. Russian TV showed him lying under a net on a field, wearing goggles and ear protection, and shooting a rifle. A military officer showed Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu soldiers wearing bulletproof vests and helmets, with weapons. The officer displayed winter boots, clothes, cooking utensils and other supplies -- all to counter images Russians have posted on social media of shabby or non-existent gear for newly mobilized troops.\n\nIn another sign of Russia's wavering mobilization, Ukrainian authorities said more than 3,000 Russians have called a hotline for soldiers who don't want to take part in the war and are asking to surrender.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nRussian forces attacked Ukrainian positions near Bilohorivka, a village in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk region. In the neighbouring Donetsk region, fighting raged near the city of Bakhmut. Kremlin-backed separatists have controlled parts of both regions for 8 1/2 years.\n\nRussia continued attacking energy infrastructure, dispatching drones and missiles to eight regions, prompting authorities to ask residents to reduce energy consumption from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and to dim city street lights. They warned of rolling blackouts continuing Friday. In Kryvyi Rih, Russian strikes damaged a power plant and another energy facility, cutting electricity to the central Ukraine city of about 600,000 residents. Kryvyi Rih is home to metallurgical factories key to Ukraine's economy. Gov. Valentin Reznichenko said the city sustained serious damage.\n\nUkrainian authorities said missile and drone strikes started fires in the southern city of Mykolaiv, with four drones hitting a school. Another school in Komyshuvakha, a village in Zaporizhzhia, also took four drone strikes.\n\nThe Ukrainian army's general staff reported a heightened chance that Russian forces could attack from Belarus to cut supply routes for Western weapons and equipment. Oleksei Hromov, a general staff official, said Russia was deploying aircraft and troops in Belarus.\n\nThe White House said Iranian troops are \"directly engaged on the ground\" in Crimea supporting Russian drone attacks, troubling evidence of Tehrans deepening role assisting Russia as it exacts suffering on Ukrainian civilians just as the cold weather sets in.\n\nDespite the Kremlin's and Iran's claims to the contrary, a leading Russian military expert unwittingly acknowledged that Iran has supplied Russia with weaponized drones it uses in Ukraine. Ruslan Pukhov, head of the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow-based think tank, asked journalists before a TV interview not to question him about where the drones came from, unaware that he was live on air. \"We all know that they are Iranian-made, but authorities havent acknowledged that,\" Pukhov said.\n\nThe EU on Thursday imposed sanctions on Irans Shahed Aviation Industries, as well as three Iranian armed forces generals, for undermining Ukraines territorial integrity by helping to supply Russia with drones.\n\n___\n\nLorne Cook in Brussels, Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, and Andrew Katell in New York contributed to this report.",

Many have had to buy their own body armour, for instance.\n\nThe chairman of the new council, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, told Putin: \"We need to intensify work to increase the production of personal protective equipment.\n\n\"It is necessary to include all the capacities of light industry, including small enterprises, for the production of military equipment ... We need to make sure that our defenders do not lack equipment.\"\n\nWriting by Kevin Liffey; Editing by William Maclean\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The Kyiv regime, as you know, refused to recognize the will and choice of people, rejects any proposals for negotiations. On the contrary, shelling continues.

The breadth and scope of what is effectively a military takeover is yet to be detailed but martial law generally sees civil rights subsumed to military rule, though how far that changes the current situation for civilians in annexed regions in Ukraine remains to be seen.\n\nIn this case it appears the decree, published by the Kremlin, gives the authorities \"powers to carry out mobilization measures in the economic sphere\" in terms of \"civil defense measures, protection of the population and territories from natural and man-made emergencies\" and the power \"to implement measures to meet the needs of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, other troops, military formations ... and the needs of the population.\"\n\nA Ukrainian presidential advisor dismissed the declaration of martial law Wednesday, describing it as the \"pseudo-legalization of looting of Ukrainians' property.\"",

The decree published by Ukraine's presidency on Tuesday evening did not specify why the ambassador was relieved of his duties and did not appoint a replacement.\n\nIn early October, Kazakhstan's foreign ministry summoned Russia's ambassador in the ex-Soviet country for a \"serious talk\" following Moscow's demand to expel the country's Ukraine envoy.\n\nTies between Russia and Kazakhstan have been strained since the launch of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, with the Central Asian country seeking to balance ties with the West and ally Moscow. Kazakh leader Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has publicly disagreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine.\n\nHe also assured the safety of thousands of Russians fleeing to Kazakhstan after the announcement of Moscow's military call-up in September.\n\n5:00 a.m.: The Russian-installed leader of the annexed Ukrainian region of Kherson said on Wednesday that authorities plan to evacuate around 50-60,000 people over the next six days amid escalating pressure from a Ukrainian counteroffensive, Reuters reported.\n\nSpeaking on an online broadcast of \"Soloviev Live,\" Russian-installed governor Vladimir Saldo said authorities were moving civilians to the left bank of the Dnipro in order to \"keep people safe\" and allow the military to \"act resolutely.\"\n\n\"I drove through the regional center this morning. On the exterior, there was nothing to suggest there was a lot of pressure,\" Saldo said.\n\n\"But when I arrived at the river port, I saw that the boats were waiting and are already loaded with people ready to go to the left bank of the Dnipro,\" he said, adding that the situation \"is getting tense.\"\n\nHe said an estimated 10,000 people a day would be moved over the next six days, and that some regions in Russia were being prepared to accept people.\n\nMore than 5,000 people have already left Kherson in the last two days, Saldo told state television.\n\nRussian forces in the Kherson region have been driven back by 20-30 kilometers (13-20 miles) in the last few weeks and are at risk of being pinned against the western bank of the 2,200-kilometers-long Dnipro River that traverses through Ukraine.\n\n4:30 a.m.: Russian telecoms-to-healthcare conglomerate Sistema agreed a $256-million deal for a stake in Melon Fashion Group Reuters reported Wednesday, months after the retail outlet scrapped plans for an initial public offering, or IPO, due to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nBased in St. Petersburg on a site that housed a sewing factory in Soviet times, Melon owns four mainly women's fashion brands Zarina, Befree, Love Republic and Sela and had 846 stores across Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan and Belarus at the end of 2021.\n\nPlans for an IPO sometime this year were shelved after Russia launched what it calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement, Sistema said it would acquire 47.7% of Melon from Swedish investment group Eastnine and East Capital Holding and some private investors for a total of $256 million (15.8 billion roubles).\n\nFor Eastnine, the sale represents a rare successful exit for a Western firm offloading its Russian assets. It will secure around $189 million (193 million euros) for its 36% stake, Eastnine said in a statement.\n\nAt the end of 2021, it valued its shares at $120 million (122 million euros), and in March warned the conflict in Ukraine would see that drop.\n\nSeveral Western companies and investors have sold their Russian operations for token sums as part of an exodus of Western companies. Sistema President Tagir Sitdekov said Melon Fashion Group \"is growing fast and demonstrating operational excellence,\" and said Sistema had the right experience to continue developing the company.\n\nThe deal is expected to be completed by the end of 2022, Sistema and Eastnine said in separate statements. It is subject to regulatory approvals by Russia's competition authorities and will require the greenlight of a Kremlin commission established earlier this year to govern the disposal of Russian assets by Western firms.\n\n4:00 a.m.: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday Russia's missile and drone attacks on power stations and other infrastructure in Ukraine are \"acts of pure terror\" that amount to war crimes, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Yesterday we saw again Russia's targeted attacks against civilian infrastructure. This is marking another chapter in an already very cruel war. The international order is very clear. These are war crimes,\" von der Leyen said in a speech to lawmakers in the European Parliament.\n\n\"Targeted attacks on civilian infrastructure with the clear aim to cut off men, women, children of water, electricity and heating with the winter coming, these are acts of pure terror and we have to call it as such.\"\n\n3:30 a.m.: Belarus said on Wednesday that it had begun summoning citizens to check their eligibility for military service but that it was not planning mobilization, Reuters reported.\n\n\"The military registration and enlistment activities are strictly routine and are expected to be completed by the end of this year,\" the defense ministry said.\n\n3:25 a.m.: A scheme used in Spain and Portugal to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity is worth considering for implementation across the European Union, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday.\n\n\"It really merits to be considered at EU level.

But not everybody agrees that it should be so, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nBakhmut is located in eastern Ukraine's industrial Donbas region, where Russia-backed rebels started a conflict in 2014 and loyalties are often very divided.\n\nSocial media groups created by local residents in Bakhmut, which had 70,000 residents before the war, contain posts that criticize the Ukrainian army's actions but stop short of actively supporting Russia.\n\n2:00 a.m.:\n\n1:20 a.m.: The United States, Britain and France have asked for the U.N. Security Council to discuss the issue of Russia using Iranian drones in the war in Ukraine.\n\nDiplomats said Tuesday the request included asking for a U.N. official to brief the council during a closed-door meeting Wednesday.\n\nUkrainian officials have said drones used in waves of attacks during the past week, including on Ukraines capital, Kyiv, were Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack drones that Russia used to carry explosives and crash into their targets.\n\nIran has denied supplying the drones to Russia, and Russian officials have denied using them.\n\nEstonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur told reporters Tuesday he expects more drone attacks against \"many cities in Ukraine.\"\n\nPevkur said Ukraine has managed to shoot down about half of attacking drones, but that it still needs more help. Ukrainian officials have in recent days repeated their calls for allies to provide more air defense aid.\n\nUkraines foreign ministry said that in the past week alone, more than 100 self- Iranian-made drones have slammed into power plants, sewage treatment plants, residential buildings, bridges and other targets in urban areas.\n\n12:30 a.m.: Vladimir Putin's grip on power in Russia remains firm despite military setbacks in Ukraine, a botched mobilization, and political infighting, eight well-informed sources said, but some said that could change fast if total defeat beckoned, Reuters reported.\n\nMost of them said the Russian president was in one of the tightest spots in his more than two decades in power over Ukraine, where his invading forces have been pushed back in places by a Western-armed Kyiv.\n\nBut the sources, including current and former Western diplomats and government officials, said no imminent threat was apparent from his inner circle, military or intelligence services.\n\n\"For the moment, Putin is hanging in there,\" said Anthony Brenton, a former British ambassador to Russia.\n\n12:15 a.m.: Poland is set to sign a framework agreement for the purchase of 288 K239 Chunmoo multiple rocket launchers from South Korea, the Polish defense ministry said on Tuesday, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nUnder the deal set to be signed 18 of the rocket launchers will be delivered in 2023 and mounted on Polish Jelcz vehicles.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the system can carry ballistic missiles with a range of 290 kilometers as well as guided missiles with an 80-kilometer range.\n\nPoland has massively stepped up its weapons purchases since Russia invaded Ukraine, as well as sending military aid to Kyiv and taking in millions of Ukrainian refugees.\n\n12:05 a.m.: U.S. F-16 warplanes intercepted two Russian bombers in international airspace near the U.S. state of Alaska on Tuesday, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe Tu-95 bombers were intercepted after \"entering and operating within the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone,\" NORAD said in a statement.\n\nThe Air Defense Identification Zone, or the ADIZ, is a perimeter in which air traffic is monitored beyond the border of national airspace to provide additional reaction time in case of hostile actions.\n\nInterceptions of Russian aircraft in the area which is close to the country's far eastern border are relatively frequent.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nHe didnt immediately describe the steps that would be taken under martial law but said his order was effective starting at midnight on October 20. His decree gives law enforcement agencies three days to submit specific proposals.\n\nThe package of moves, which come nearly eight months into the war launched by the Kremlin in late February, marked the latest escalation by Putin to counter a series of defeats to Ukrainian forces since the start of September.\n\nBy extending the decree to regions beyond Ukraine, the move ensures that more Russians, already angered by a military mobilization announced last month, will more deeply feel the consequences of the war in their own lives.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office's head, called Putin's move \"a pseudo-legalization of looting of Ukrainians' property.\"\n\n\"This does not change anything for Ukraine: We continue the liberation and deoccupation of our territories,\" Podolyak tweeted shortly after Putin announced martial law in the four Ukrainian regions.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, speaking at the White House, said Putin is trying to get Ukraine to give up.\n\n\"I think that Vladimir Putin finds himself in an incredible difficult position and what it reflects to me is it seems his only tool available to him is to brutalize the individual citizens in Ukraineto try to intimidate them into capitulating. They are not going to do that,\" Biden said.\n\nU.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said earlier the declaration of martial law was a desperate tactic and any claim by Russia over the regions was \"illegitimate.\"\n\nPutin's move came as the Russia-installed leader of Ukraine's southern Kherson region said the evacuation has started of tens of thousands of civilians and Moscow-appointed officials in the face of a Ukrainian military advance.\n\nVladimir Saldo said 50,000-60,000 civilians would leave four towns on the west bank of the Dnieper River in an \"organized, gradual displacement\" over the next five or six days.\n\nAll of the Moscow-installed administration in the city of Kherson would evacuate, too, Saldo said.\n\nRussian television showed footage of a number of people queuing for boats on the Dnieper River bank although it was not immediately clear how many were leaving. The forced transfer or deportation of the civilian population by an occupying power from the territory under its control is considered a war crime.\n\nSaldo's statements came after General Sergei Surovikin, the new commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, said the situation in the southern city of Kherson is \"difficult\" and residents facing Ukrainian bombardment are to be evacuated.\n\nWATCH: Ukrainian forces first got their hands on FH70 155-millimeter howitzers courtesy of Italy in May and received training in Estonia. RFE/RL journalists met with a frontline FH70 crew and watched them in action against Russian forces.\n\n\"The Russian Army will above all ensure the safe evacuation of the population\" of Kherson, Surovikin said.\n\nBut Kyiv on October 19 accused Russia of staging a propaganda show in an attempt to \"scare\" the Kherson residents.\n\n\"Russians are trying to scare the people of Kherson with fake messages about the shelling of the city by our army and are also staging a propaganda show with evacuation,\" the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram.\n\nKherson was the first big city to fall to the Russian forces in February after the start of Moscow's unprovoked invasion, but Ukrainian forces have been steadily retaking nearby territory in recent weeks.\n\nThey have pushed as far as 30 kilometers south along the Dnieper River, threatening to trap Russian troops.\n\nMeanwhile, fresh explosions were heard in Kyiv and other areas on October 19, with a missile strike hitting a major thermal power station in the city of Burshtyn in western Ukraine.\n\nThe coal-fired Burshtyn plant in the region of Ivano-Frankivsk, which supplies electricity to three western regions and to five million consumers, was hit and on fire, according to Svytlana Onysshchuk, the regional governor. There were no casualties in the strike at the plant, which was hit by four missiles nine days earlier as well.\n\nSerhiy Borzov, governor of the Vinnytsya region in western Ukraine, said Russia had also carried out attacks on energy facilities in his region. Russian bombardment also cut power and water in some parts of Enerhodar in the Zaporizhzhya region on October 19, said Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of the southern city located near the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant that's been a flashpoint of the nearly eight-month conflict.\n\nA power plant in Kryviy Rih, a city in south-central Ukraine, was also seriously damaged by Russian shelling, leaving villages, towns, and a city district without electricity, the regional governor reported.\n\nRussian forces also targeted Ukraine's southern Mykolayiv region again with kamikaze drones early on October 19.\n\nThe Ukrainian military's southern command said in a statement on October 19 that its forces shot down 12 drones overnight.\n\nMore than a week of air attacks has destroyed almost one-third of Ukraine's power stations and cut electricity in more than 1,000 settlements.\n\nWith Ukraine gaining momentum in the war that is now nearly eight months old, European lawmakers on October 19 recognized the country's \"brave\" citizens by awarding them the 2022 Sakharov Prize.\n\n\"This award is for those Ukrainians fighting on the ground. For those who have been forced to flee. For those who have lost relatives and friends. For all those who stand up and fight for what they believe in. I know that the brave people of Ukraine will not give up and neither will we,\" European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said in the statement.\n\nThe annual prize is named after the Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov and was established in 1988 by the European parliament to honor individuals and organizations defending human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AP, and AFP",

The transfer or deportation of civilians by an occupying power from occupied territory is considered a war crime.\n\nIn a separate development, Russia's Vladimir Putin said he had signed a decree imposing martial law on four Ukrainian regions, including Kherson, which Moscow annexed last month in a move rejected as illegal by the international community.\n\nHe told Russia's Security Council that it would give regional leaders additional powers to maintain social order and safeguard important facilities.\n\nOn Tuesday night, residents in Kherson started receiving text messages, urging them to evacuate immediately to avoid shelling of residential areas by Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe messages said transport across the Dnipro River would be available from 07:00 on Wednesday.\n\n\"They are told to evacuate because the evil Ukrainians are going to shell the city,\" one resident told the BBC, asking to remain anonymous.\n\n\"People are panicking because of propaganda.\"\n\nRussian TV footage on Wednesday showed a number of people gathering near the west bank of the Dnieper. As they queued for boats, it was not clear how many were leaving.\n\nBut Ukrainian officials have questioned whether large numbers of people are actually being evacuated, suggesting that images of a crowd assembled by the river are largely for show.\n\nSerhiy Khlan, an aide to the ousted head of the Kherson region, suggested the \"deportations theatre\" could be acting as cover for a much bigger Russian move: a complete military evacuation from the west bank of the river.\n\n\"I foresee the withdrawal of troops,\" he said, adding that he expected Russian forces to attempt to destroy the city after leaving.\n\nRussia, he said, was planning to establish a new capital for the Kherson region at Henichesk, close to the Crimean Peninsula, adding that banks and offices related to the occupation of Kherson had already been evacuated.\n\nOne Kherson resident told the BBC's World Service that she was not going anywhere until Kherson was liberated by Ukrainian troops: \"People are not panicking, nobody wants to be evacuated.\"\n\nShe said that Russian soldiers were now worried how they could survive in the city. \"There are plenty of them here; they are dressed as civilians. We can see them - they are different to Kherson people. They walk in groups, their hair is cut short, they are dressed mainly in black.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have warned that this might represent the start of a forcible deportation to Russia.\n\nIn early September, the UN said there were already credible accusations of forced deportation of Ukrainian children from other Russian-occupied areas. Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzia, called the allegations \"unfounded\".\n\nReuters\n\nPresident Putin has also announced heightened security levels inside Russia\n\nAs part of the decree, President Putin announced three additional levels of heightened security inside Russia.\n\nThe highest level applies to Russia-annexed Crimea and other areas near the border with Ukraine, such as the regions of Belgorod, Kursk and Krasnodar.\n\nIn these areas, there will be more security, possible evacuation orders and some restrictions placed on travel. Regional authorities will be given more powers to ensure measures are implemented, establish territorial defence and \"mobilise\" the economy for the war effort.\n\nIn Moscow and surrounding central and southern regions, regional authorities have the power to introduce similar, but less severe, restrictions.\n\nGetty Images\n\nUkraine said recently it had recaptured more than 400 sq km of territory in less than a week\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak pointed out it was less than a month since Russia had held a ceremony to annex Kherson: \"Reality can hurt if you live in a fictional fantasy world.\"\n\nLate on Monday, Russia's new military commander in Ukraine, Gen Sergei Surovikin, had described the situation in Kherson city, the regional capital, as difficult.\n\nA Russian-installed official, Kirill Stremousov, warned Kherson residents that Ukrainian forces would launch an assault on the city \"in the very near future\". \"No-one is going to retreat, but we also want to save your life. Please move as quickly as possible to the left bank,\" he added.\n\nMr Saldo, who was appointed governor of the region by Moscow, told Russian TV that no-one was about to surrender, but it was \"undesirable\" for residents to remain in a city facing military action. \"In the past two days, more than 5,000 people have left Kherson,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nThe head of Ukraine's presidential office said Moscow was trying to intimidate residents with fake news that Ukraine's military was shelling their city. \"It is a fairly primitive tactic, taking into account that the AFU [Armed Forces of Ukraine] do not shell cities,\" Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram.\n\nEarlier this month, Kherson's exiled deputy mayor said only 100,000 residents remained in Kherson city of the pre-war population of 320,000, with many fleeing Russia's occupation.\n\nThe mayor of Russian-occupied Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, warned that Kherson's civilians were facing enforced deportation and being deprived of their homes so that Russia could populate the city with \"soldiers and traitors\". Last month, Ukraine said 2.5 million people had been forcibly deported from Ukraine to Russia.\n\nThe Russian-appointed governor accused Ukraine of building up for a large-scale offensive and planning to destroy the Kakhovka dam on the River Dnieper, flooding the area.\n\nWatch: Gen Sergei Surovikin describes the situation in Ukraine as \"tense\"\n\nKherson was the first major city to fall to Russian forces when they invaded Ukraine in February. However, in just a few weeks, the Ukrainian military has recaptured territory in the north of the region and pushed as far as 30km (19 miles) south along the Dnieper, threatening to trap Russian troops.",

                "cc_text": "When Donald Trump assumed office, there were concerns that he might reverse some of the existing sanctions. Congress, which at the time was controlled by the Republicans, premptively restrained Trump, passing legislation that imposed further sanctions on Iran, North Korea, and Russia, and blocked unilateral lifting of certain penalties. Inside the Treasury Department, career staff members were confused about Trumps intentions toward Russia. One former Administration official told me that Trump did not seem interested in sanctioning Russia: \"He was focussed on Ukraine and Hunter Biden. He was focussed on Iran. He was focussed on, could he make a deal with China.\"\n\nMost of the former Treasury officials I spoke to agreed that the sanctions levied in that era were insufficient. Vladimir Ashurkov, a director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which is connected with the imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, echoed that conclusion. He said, \"If the sanctions we have now had been gradually introduced over the eight years that passed since the first hostilities started in Ukraine, in 2014,\" the current tragedy might have been avoided. \"I think they sort of encouraged Putins assertiveness over this eight-year period. By February, 2022, I think he didnt expect much retaliation.\"\n\nThe sanctions rolled out in those years also provided Putin with an opportunity he could later turn to his advantage. He and his fellow-lites in Russia learned how to accommodate and compensate for the worst penalties of the Western sanctions regime. The government built an enormous cushion of foreign reserves that could be drawn upon to prop up the value of the ruble. It also established front companies across the world that could, if needed, help with the procurement of crucial technology and components. As a result, the work of Wally Adeyemo and his colleagues this year wasnt just informed by a long line of previous sanctions programs. It was complicated by them.\n\nStanding behind public-facing officials such as Adeyemo are career civil servants, many with deep expertise, who have chosen to forgo more lucrative jobs in the private sector. One of them is Elizabeth Rosenberg, the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes. Earlier in her career, having completed graduate work in Near Eastern studies, shed covered the energy sector, national security, and sanctions as a trade journalist. But eleven years ago she decided that it was worth taking a pay cut to help create the sanctions shed been writing about.\n\nIn the autumn of 2021, when intelligence reports about Russias activities on the Ukrainian border made it plain that Putin was preparing for a large-scale invasion, she and other officials began to model steps that they might want to take, such as restricting Russian oil and gas imports, and the possible impacts those moves might have on the global economy. \"Sanctions involve costs. Theres no way around it,\" Rosenberg said. \"We are cutting ourselves off from the Russian market. We have a responsibility to make sure we are not doing more than we have to.\"\n\nA crucial aspect of the bureaucrats work is sifting through intelligence data and predicting collateral damagenot just humanitarian costs but those detrimental to U.S. economic interests. Assessments of that damage had to be considered well before any decisions were finalized.\n\n\"Word around school is youve been attributing Shakespeares works to Edward de Vere.\" Cartoon by Lars Kenseth Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nRosenberg worked closely with Andrea Gacki, the director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, who earlier in her career was at the Justice Department defending sanctions against targets who had sued the government. Through the fall and winter, the two officials consulted with their foreign counterparts about some of the knottier aspects of what they hoped to do.\n\nRosenberg and her colleagues travelled repeatedly to the U.K. and Europe. Sometimes her delegation would arrive and learn that the Europeans had budgeted only an hour or two for the meeting. \"I would say, No, were going to need a lot of time, \" Rosenberg recalled. \" We need coffee, we need snacks, we need room availability. \" Other times, they would be met with surprise when they asked that representatives of a given countrys justice department and intelligence services attend the discussion, as national-security issues were bound to come up. Hours were spent reviewing whether a particular country had the legal authority to freeze Russian assets, and, if it didnt, what it needed to do to establish such authority. After most meetings ended, Rosenberg and her team would rush to the American Embassy to send the results of the sessions to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department is the only such institution in the world that has its own intelligence agency, situated in the departments headquarters, on Pennsylvania Avenue. On the night of February 23rd, Rosenberg went through heavy metal doors, placed her phone in a lockbox, and began work on a classified memo to Yellen about proposed sanctions. In an adjoining room, intelligence analysts who are on duty twenty-four hours a day stood behind banks of blinking monitors. Around 10 p.m., one of the analysts announced that Russia had launched missiles at Ukrainian targets. The war had begun. An official in the room that night recalled how the teams sense of purpose intensified: \"I will not forget how that felt.\" Sweeping sanctions against Russia went into effect within hours.\n\nYellen told me, \"Im involved in some discussions with people at the finance-minister level. But when I hang up the phone I say, My senior staff will be in touch with yours, and I cast all of this on Andrea and Wally and Liz, and they do the heavy lifting. If this all works out, its because of them.\"\n\nSome of the plans activated in February were less comprehensive than they first appeared. Dozens of Russian officials hadnt been touched, and the initial SWIFT ban applied to only seven banks. But the sanctions designers wanted to leave room to ramp up the pressure should Putin not respond as they hoped.\n\nAs Rosenberg explained to me, designing and implementing sanctions, which are largely about economic forecasts and banking relationships, often feels like mechanical work. Typical days involve composing and editing memos and passing them up the chain. Humanitarian concerns may feel very far away. \"And then you have Bucha\"the site of a massacre of civilians by Russian forces this spring\"and you think, Oh, my God, this is why were doing it.\"\n\nNot all of what unfolded shortly after the invasion was anticipated, including a mass private-sector exodus from Russia. Within days, the anger of the Western public had moved dozens of companiesamong them Apple, Netflix, ExxonMobil, and Shellto announce that they were withdrawing from the country. Before long roughly a thousand more businesses joined them and, in Yellens account, \"multiplied the impact\" of sanctions.\n\nSingh thought that the pullout would have a lasting effect. \"Once a McDonalds leaves, it doesnt come back, especially those that had physical infrastructure that they just abandoned in Russia,\" he said. \"That was big.\"\n\nFrom the Treasury officials perspective, more penalties are not always better; heedlessly adding names to sanctions lists may have destabilizing consequences. In 2018, for instance, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the aluminum magnate and oligarch Oleg Deripaska and his companies in response to Russias invasion of Crimea and other activities. The announcement jolted the global aluminum market, prompting a price spike.\n\nThe sanctions or seizures of foreign assetsfor instance, the impounding this March by European officials of gaudy yachts linked to Rosneft, the state-controlled oil conglomerate, and to Alexey Mordashov, reportedly the richest man in Russiaare preceded by careful study and legal review. Before an individual or a company appears on a sanctions list, a multidisciplinary team at OFAC, often working with other government agencies, analyzes the potential consequences and tries to minimize unintended results.\n\nPutin countered the sanctions with strategies to create demand for rubles and drive up their value. He required that most Russian oil and gas purchases be paid in rubles, and the Russian Central Bank restricted the ability of the countrys citizens to exchange their money for foreign notes. By the end of June, the price of the ruble had rebounded. A month later, the Russian military had made slow but solid gains. Among its achievements was bombing the strategically important port of Odesa, which disrupted plans to release grain stores there that were badly needed in other parts of the world.",

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nBritain, France, and the United States issued a joint statement on October 23 dismissing the claim after Shoigu's calls with their defense ministers in which the Russian minister presented no evidence for the claim.\n\n\"Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia's transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory,\" according to the statement.\n\nBut Russia doubled down on its assertions, which come after weeks of military defeats for Russia in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"According to the information we have, two organizations in Ukraine have specific instructions to create a so-called dirty bomb. This work is in its final stage,\" Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov said on October 24.\n\nLater the same day, the chief of the Russian General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, spoke by phone with British Chief of Defense Staff Tony Radakin, who rejected Russia's allegations that Ukraine is planning actions to escalate the conflict.\n\n\"The military leaders both agreed on the importance of maintaining open channels of communication between the U.K. and Russia to manage the risk of miscalculation and to facilitate de-escalation,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nGerasimov also held a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, General Mark Milley, to discuss the risks of the use of a dirty bomb in Ukraine, according to the Kremlin-controlled RIA Novosti news agency.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg weighed in on Moscow's repeated allegation on October 24 , saying NATO also rejects it.\n\nStoltenberg said he had spoken with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace \"about Russia's false claim that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory.\"\n\n\"NATO Allies reject this allegation.

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nSummary Putin tells all Russian regions to support needs of army\n\nOrder meets low-key response from regional heads\n\nKremlin chief says soldiers need proper kit\n\nMartial law in occupied regions under Ukrainian counter-attack\n\nLONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he was introducing martial law in four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine that Moscow claimed last month as its own territory but is struggling to defend from Ukrainian advances.\n\nIn televised remarks to members of his Security Council, Putin boosted the security powers of all Russia's regional governors and ordered the creation of a special coordinating council under Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to step up the faltering war effort.\n\nHe said the \"entire system of state administration\", not only the specialised security agencies, must be geared to supporting what Russia calls its \"special military operation\".\n\nThe package of moves, nearly eight months into the war, marked the latest escalation by Putin to counter a series of major defeats at the hands of Ukrainian forces since the start of September.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said Russia was resorting to \"desperate tactics\". A Kyiv official said it would change nothing.\n\nThe published Kremlin decree ordered an \"economic mobilisation\" in eight regions adjoining Ukraine, including Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014.\n\nIt placed them in a special regime one step below martial law and allowed for the restriction of people's movements.\n\nPutin conferred additional powers on the leaders of all Russia's 80-plus regions to protect critical facilities, maintain public order and increase production in support of the war effort.\n\nBut it was far from clear how fast or how effectively the new measures might bolster Russia's military position on the ground. They came as Russian-installed officials in Ukraine's occupied Kherson region told civilians to leave some areas as soon as possible in anticipation of an imminent Ukrainian attack.\n\nRussia expert Mark Galeotti said on Twitter the moves amounted to \"a declaration of variegated martial law across the whole of Russia\", with some level of emergency regulation now applying across the whole country.\n\nHe said it was unclear whether regional officials would use the extra powers as Moscow wanted, ignore them, or exploit them as opportunities to embezzle state resources.\n\nThe Russian-installed acting governor of occupied Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, confirmed that he would hand power to the military, according to Russian news agencies. But many regional chiefs - including Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin - said they did not plan to make any immediate changes.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter: \"This does not change anything for Ukraine: we continue the liberation and de-occupation of our territories.\"\n\nURGENT MEASURES\n\nUkrainian gains have forced Putin into a series of escalatory steps within the past month: the unpopular call-up of hundreds of thousands of extra troops, the unilateral annexation of the four Ukrainian regions - condemned as illegal by an overwhelming majority of nations at the U.N. General Assembly - and a threat to resort to nuclear weapons to defend what Russia sees as its own lands.\n\nAfter months of assurances from the Kremlin that the campaign was going according to plan, the increasingly urgent measures have brought the reality of the war much closer to home for many ordinary Russians.\n\nThe failings of the military and the chaotic state of the mobilisation - which prompted hundreds of thousands of men to flee abroad - have drawn unprecedented criticism even from Putin allies.\n\nSome regions have resorted to public appeals to provide newly mobilised soldiers with basic equipment to head to the front - a problem implicitly acknowledged by Putin.\n\n\"Our soldiers, no matter what tasks they perform, must be provided with everything they need. This applies to the equipment of barracks and places of deployment, living conditions, kit and gear, food and medical care,\" he said.\n\n\"We have every opportunity to resolve all the issues that arise here - and they do exist - at a modern level that is worthy of our country.\"\n\nPaul Stronski, a Russia expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Putin was placing more responsibility on regional heads by ordering them onto a war footing, but without making clear what they actually needed to do.\n\nStronski, a former Russia specialist at the U.S. State Department, said the president's orders epitomised Moscow's struggles to implement an effective war plan.\n\n\"Putin had a vision seven months ago, it's gone horribly wrong and he still hasn't quite figured out how to fix that vision of how to run a war,\" he said.\n\nReporting by Reuters; writing by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Russia has suffered weeks of setbacks on the battlefield, and its proxies in the southern region of Kherson have begun relocating civilians in apparent anticipation of a major fight for the regional capital.\n\nMoscow has been ordering residents of the region living west of the Dnipro River to evacuate before a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive, a move that Kyiv has dismissed as scaremongering. Just before Mr. Putins speech, videos released on Russian media showed lines of civilians apparently boarding ferries at a river port to evacuate.\n\n\"I signed a decree on the introduction of martial law in these four constituent entities of the Russian Federation,\" Mr. Putin said at the start of a meeting of his Security Council via videoconference, referring to the four Ukrainian regions that the Kremlin unilaterally declared to be part of Russia. \"In addition, in the current situation, I consider it necessary to give additional powers to the leaders of all Russian regions.\"\n\nWithin hours of the decree, the Federation Council, the upper house of Parliament, approved it unanimously.\n\nAs of late last month, the Russian army controlled most of the Luhansk and Kherson regions and about half of the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. Martial law in the four annexed territories would allow the authorities to impose curfews, seize property, imprison undocumented immigrants, establish checkpoints, detain people for up to 30 days and forcibly resettle residents to another region.\n\nThe president also ordered the creation of territorial defense forces, a type of civilian militia, in the four annexed regions, raising the possibility that Moscows forces may try to conscript Ukrainians to fight their own countrys forces, part of a broader effort to mobilize hundreds of thousands of new fighters as its forces suffer huge casualties.\n\nMr. Putin has grappled with growing anger at home over his call-up of about 300,000 reservists to fight in the war. Protests have erupted in far-flung cities, recruitment centers have been the target of arson and thousands of military-age men have packed planes and vehicles to flee across Russias borders.\n\nSome analysts said the Russian leader is being forced to signal to his nation that there may be more pain to come.\n\n\"Putin has to prepare the country for much harder times, and he needs to mobilize resources,\" Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political analyst, said in a phone interview\n\nAnalysts said it was remarkable that Mr. Putin declared martial law, since he continues to avoid calling the invasion of Ukraine a \"war\" and instead uses the term \"special military operation.\"\n\n\"When you call it a war, it means that your special military operation failed,\" Ms. Stanovaya said.\n\nAbbas Gallyamov, a former Kremlin speechwriter turned political consultant, said the decision to declare martial law in occupied Ukraine and impose other restrictions inside Russia appeared more focused on suppressing internal dissent than improving its flailing war effort.\n\n\"In general, all this looks not so much like a struggle with an external enemy, as much as an attempt to prevent the ripening revolution within the country,\" Mr. Gallyamov wrote on Telegram.\n\nThe separate decree allows for significantly more restrictive measures to be introduced in 26 regions across Russia, closest to Ukraine, including in Moscow, to more tightly control critical infrastructure facilities, public transit and communications. According to Mr. Putin, the regional leaders will be given additional powers \"to ensure security.\"\n\nAs with many Russian laws, there are open provisions that allow for broad interpretation and regional governors can choose which they enforce. For example, the law allows for suspension of the activities of political parties, public organizations and religious groups, or any activity deemed to undermine the defense and security of the Russian Federation. It also allows governors to set up restrictions to the entry and exit from their region.\n\nReporting was contributed by Oleg Matsnev , Valeriya Safronova , Ivan Nechepurenko and Neil MacFarquhar .",

                "cc_text": "SECRETARY MATTIS: Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to todays event, a conversation between former Secretary of State Dr. Condoleezza Rice and our current Secretary of State Tony Blinken. At a time when America is navigating its role in a changing world, todays talk in the finest tradition of the great university where we meet offers a unique opportunity to delve into important issues.\n\nIm Jim Mattis, a Fellow here at Hoover, where we seek to improve the human condition by advancing ideas that promote economic opportunity while safeguarding peace. Thanks to their record of devoted service to our nation, little introduction is needed for these two patriots. America is one great, big, promising, exasperating, inspiring, and vexing experiment with all the political volatility inherent to a free and open society.\n\nAdmired leadership in our republic calls for certain characteristics: first, a humble awareness of each generations responsibility to improve on this experiment in forming a more perfect union; and second, competence. The two citizens on this stage are exemplars of both characteristics. Dr. Rices contribution over many years of leadership cannot be summed up in a few words. Suffice that through merit, conviction, and a keen perceptiveness of the world we must live in, she rose to the apex of our government, ultimately splitting eight years of leadership between service as our National Security Advisor and as our 66th Secretary of State. Were proud to call her boss and coach of the Hoover team.\n\nSecretary Blinken has also accumulated a lengthy portfolio of foreign affairs experience before becoming our Secretary of State. It wasnt long after graduation from Harvard and Columbia that he entered government service, ultimately serving as the Deputy National Security Advisor and Deputy Secretary of State following his time on Capitol Hill, where he served as the staff director for the Senates Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nIn a recent talk with graduates, he suggested that if theyre going to spend a lot of their lives at work, then they should work at something they love. Our nation is fortunate that both these leaders devote their best efforts to something they love, and that is America. In so doing, their leadership by example reminds each of us that government service in a democracy is both privilege and responsibility. As problem solvers during these tumultuous years, their leadership forged trust while navigating maddeningly complex issues. Holding our values foremost, they have dealt pragmatically with a swiftly changing world filled by the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nThey have done so while listening and maintaining respect for those who disagreed with them, strengthening a necessary attribute for leadership in a democracy. Todays discussion will focus on the evolution and importance of technology, diplomacy, and national security familiar topics here in Silicon Valley and highly relevant across our nation and round the world.\n\nHoover Institution was established to advance the principles of freedom. We ask bold questions and propose solutions to help guide American policy at home and abroad. In that spirit and consistent with Stanfords role of promoting the free competition of ideas, lets get started. First a conversation, then Q&A. Again, please give a hearty welcome to Secretaries Blinken and Rice. (Applause.)\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Well, thank you very much. But before we get started, I just have to say that that gentleman, Secretary Mattis, served as our Secretary of Defense but also many years of service as a Marine, something also carried by a great patron of this place, George Shultz. And so Id like you to give Secretary Mattis a hand, please. (Applause.)\n\nWelcome. Welcome to Stanford. Welcome to Hoover. Welcome to the Silicon Valley.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Its wonderful to be back. Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: And its probably nice to be here, right?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Theres something about occasionally getting out of Washington that isnt a bad thing. (Laughter.)\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah, its a good thing. A good thing, right. (Laughter.)\n\nWell, were going to have a conversation and then we will open for a few questions and answers. Im still a professor; I will call on somebody if nobody raises their hand (laughter) so get ready with your questions.\n\nYouve just had a pretty momentous week, and I dont just mean whats going on in the world, but I mean the release of the National Security Strategy. And for those who dont fully follow these things, I think the National Security Strategy is an opportunity for the President to really ask his team: What should we be doing now to prepare for a better future? And the National Security Strategy has a number of elements that Id like you to speak to, and Im going to start with one thats kind of near and dear to the heart of every secretary of state probably going back to our long-long-time predecessor Thomas Jefferson. In case you didnt know it, he was the first secretary of state.\n\nBut you start with talking about American values but also the competition between autocracy and democracy. Can you expand a little bit on how you think about this moment? The United States has had many competitors across its history, but this particular moment, how do you think about this big issue?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, first let me just say how wonderful it is to be back at Stanford, to be with my friend Dr. Rice. Jim, Ive been an admirer of yours and your leadership for many, many years, and today you again reaffirmed why you have such a strong, powerful, eloquent voice. Its great to be with you. Thank you.\n\nAnd first of all, Im wondering: Do you have classes? (Laughter.) What are you getting credit? (Laughter.)\n\nOne of the things that I think is almost visceral to us right now is that were at an inflection point. And to put it in broad perspective, the post Cold War era is over and there is now an intense competition underway to shape what comes next. Thats the moment we think that were living in.\n\nPart of this is the renewed but also new great power competition, and thats very much at the heart of the strategy. Part of this is trying to figure out ways, and in ways that we haven t before, how to solve some really big challenges that are actually having a direct impact on the lives of our people, whether it is global health and weve been living through COVID whether its the impact of climate change, whether its just the role of all of the emerging technologies, so many of them coming from here, that are shaping our lives. All of that is reflected in the strategy.\n\nNow, this is Dr. Rice and I both worked on a few of these in our time. Rarely have so many labored for so long\n\nSECRETARY RICE: And you can drop the Dr. Rice if you right, right.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you. But rarely I think we would both say rarely have so many in government worked for so long on something read by so few. (Laughter.) But having said that, it is an important document because it does try to give coherence to what were doing. And its important across the government so that all of the different agencies and departments are kind of working off of the same blueprint, and internationally so that both friend and foe alike have a good idea about what were all about, why were doing what were doing, why were saying what were saying.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: You talked about the great power rivalry, and this is something that I dont think we really ever thought we would see again after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But indeed it has come back and its come back with force, and Id like you to address the two big rivals.\n\nThe National Security Strategy talks about restraining Russia and outcompeting China, and thats two very different ways to think about the great powers. So and perhaps you want to weave a little bit of Ukraine into the Russia story, but can you start with restraining Russia some would say a declining power in the great power competition, but one that is on the front pages now every day?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I think declining power is probably a fair assessment, but one that has an enormous capacity if it chooses to use it to do damage, to be a disrupter. And of course, we see that front and center on our front pages every day in Ukraine.\n\nWhen we started out and again, weve both been dealing with this for a long time, and Condi knows more has in a sense forgotten more about Russia than Ill know for many years of working these issues. I think many administrations have come in with the hope that we might have a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia precisely because we have so many big things that we want to be working on that go to the betterment of the lives of our people and people around the world.\n\nHowever, Russia especially under President Putin is a major disrupter and one that can make tremendous trouble. We see that in Ukraine. But we see it in its basic opposition and Putins basic opposition to the order that emerged after two World Wars and then after the Cold War with a basic set of rules and principles that we thought were necessary to try to help keep international peace and security.\n\nThis is in direct opposition to what President Putin is trying to do in reconstituting take your pick a Russian empire or a Soviet one. And its manifesting itself in the actions hes taken. Weve seen this play out over the last almost decade now. But for us and Ill just say this very briefly the reason theres so much focus on Ukraine is twofold. One is Ukraine itself. I think it bothers all of us profoundly when one country tries to lord it over another, when it tries to assert a world in which might makes right, in which it changes borders by force, in which it tries to subjugate another country to its will. Thats whats going on.\n\nBut whats also going in this: Its not only an aggression against Ukraine. It is an aggression against the basic principles that are embodied in the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a whole series of norms and rules that many generations labored to build. And are they perfect? Far from it. Have we made many mistakes both in designing them and in their application? Yes. But fundamentally they have helped make sure that we didnt have another global conflict after two world wars. And what Russia is doing, what Putin is doing, is in direct opposition to those.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Its not your job exclusively, but there are Americans who say: Why Ukraine? Why not Peoria or Des Moines? And you just talked about the rules-based order. Can you sharpen it for Americans as to why this conflict is so important? Because this may go on a while, and we may have to sustain American support and therefore democratic support for a long time.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: At least from my perspective, if we and others are not standing up for these basic understandings, these basic rules, the idea that countries independence should be respected, its territorial integrity should be respected, not changed by force; if we dont stand up for that and we can do that in a variety of ways, which we can come to if we dont stand up to that where its being challenged, then the risk you have is opening a Pandoras box, where aggressors not just in Europe, not just Russia will take a lesson and say: I can act with impunity; I can do this. And thats going to stir up conflicts in many parts of the world.\n\nAnd the one thing we know from history is that inevitably, one way or another, this pulls us in. And if we can do whatever we can to prevent rather than having to respond and to make sure that some of these rules are upheld even as we try to modernize them even as we try to make sure that they reflect the world that were living in, not just the world that they were written in, which in many cases was 70 years ago I think its clearly in our interest to do that. And thats what were trying to show in Ukraine.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Right. Lets talk about the other great power. Ill come to a regional power in a moment, but lets talk about the great power, China. Big party congress going on. Lots at stake. Xi Jinping is likely to be coronated for his third term. And hes been a little bit of a different Chinese leader. It used to be said of Chinese leaders, when I was there Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin before him \"hide and bide.\" Just keep developing China the Chinese would always say, \"Oh, were just a developing country; we dont really do foreign policy.\"\n\nWell, Xi Jinping has a quite different view of Chinas role. And 30-plus years of kind of a integrationist narrative about China seems to be coming apart. Youve called it \"outcompeting\" China, which I think is an interesting concept. So talk about China and the United States in this regard.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, youre exactly right. Weve seen a very different China emerge in recent years under Xi Jinpings leadership. It is more repressive at home, its more aggressive abroad, and in many instances that poses a challenge to our own interests, as well as to our own values. But I also think its important not to reduce this to a bumper sticker. This relationship is among the most consequential that we have. Its among the most challenging we have. Its among the most complicated that we have. And what weve seen in recent years is the emergence of or clearly adversarial aspects to the relationship; for sure and Ill come back to it quickly competitive aspects; but there also remain cooperative aspects. And we cant lose sight of those, because some of the really big problems that we have to find ways to solve are a lot harder to solve if the United States and China are not actually engaged in trying to solve them: climate, global health, et cetera.\n\nBut the competitive aspect is front and center, because this is, as I suggested, at least from our perspective, a competition to shape what comes next after this post-Cold War period. What does it look like? Whose values are going to be reflected in what we do? And from our perspective at least, we have a basic choice, because we find and I think this has been evident over the especially over the period since the Second World War the world doesnt organize itself. And for the United States, the choice is this: If were not playing a part in the organizing, if were not taking a leadership role in that, then one of two things either someone else is, and it may well be China, and there, again, probably not in a way that fully reflects our interests and values; or maybe just as bad, no ones doing it, and then you tend to have vaccums that get filled with bad things before they get filled with good things.\n\nSo we have an interest in engaging, we have an interest in leading, and we have an interest in making sure that, to the extent were in competition over what this new thing looks like, we are bringing everything to the table. In my own judgment, China also wants an order, but its a profoundly illiberal order. The order that we seek again, imperfectly is a more liberal one, and thats what that competition is about.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Im going to come back to how we do this, because you talk a lot about investing in our own strengths\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: but I want to stay for a moment on the relationship with China. You gave a very good speech a few months ago in which you talked about Id call it a rather nuanced approach to China. As youve said, that theres some areas of conflict, some areas of competition, and some areas of cooperation. Pretty quickly, the Chinese came out and said: not gonna happen let me put it that way because we cant delink these things. Do you have some hope that there might still be room? Maybe after the party congress is over, maybe after our own version of the party congress, the midterms, are over then would there be room, and where would you see those potential areas of cooperation with China?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: The world fundamentally expects this of us, so whether China wants to find ways to cooperate or not on particularly climate, global health, maybe counternarcotics, even if they dont want to, theres a huge demand signal from the world. They expect us to try to find ways to advance these issues, and if we can, together, because its affecting them as well as us.\n\nWe know were not going to be able to deal with climate as we should if China is not part of the picture. Its going to have to decide; we cant decide for it. It has to decide whether its in its interests, but its also getting pressure from others around the world to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.\n\nSame thing on global health. And this is not about pointing fingers for the pandemic its about figuring out how do we build a more secure global health system so that this doesnt happen again. China needs to be part of that answer. But its going to have to judge for itself whether, in its relationship with us, it finds ways to pursue cooperation, whether it just has to be responsive to demand signals that its getting from countries around the world to be a positive actor, not a negative actor, on issues that concern them not just China, not just the United States.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: We had reasonable cooperation at one time on another troublesome part of the world, North Korea. Obviously, its been in the news again recently. Any thoughts on whether or not that scenario its really nonproliferation. Do you really want nuclear weapons in the hands of, shall we say, troublesome regimes like the North Koreans?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: This has been a challenge going back every administration I think we were each involved in, in one way or another, and one that has manifestly not gotten better over the years. I think from the leaderships perspective in North Korea, part of what were seeing is it doesnt like to be ignored.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And so when the world is focused elsewhere, this is a reminder that: Were still here. Were still a problem. You have to deal with it.\n\nBut theres something else going on as well. Over the last months, going back about a year, we have significantly increased our own work with our allies and partners in the region South Korea, Japan both on a bilateral basis where weve, for example, renewed exercises that wed had for years that were put in abeyance a few years ago we brought them back, military exercises, to make sure that we could defend and hopefully deter any kind of North Korean aggression as well as work thats being done now in ways that it hadnt been in recent years among the United States, Japan, Korea together, which has lots of benefits, including bringing Korea and Japan closer together. I think that Kim Jong-un saw that and didnt like it, and its a response to that.\n\nWeve taken a variety of actions, including at the United Nations, including strengthening even more our defense and deterrence, but it is an ongoing problem. And it does go, Condi, to exactly what youre talking about, which are concerns about broader proliferation. At the end of the day, one of the most important and powerful things about trying to continue to advance nonproliferation, preventing the spread of weapons, as well as arms control ourselves and being responsible actors under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, is making sure that we dont have a world where a whole variety of countries conclude that theyre going to be better off if they acquire nuclear weapons that they dont have. And we know that thats a world thats going to be even more fraught. So we have to find ways to reinforce these norms, these rules, these standards that weve signed on to and that need our engagement.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Im going to come to technology in just a moment, I promise you, but I will get lots of messages that say you didnt ask him about Iran. Do you want to say just a word about that situation? Its extraordinary moments these days.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: What were seeing is really is remarkable. And it starts with the incredible courage of very young people, especially women and girls, who are standing up for their most basic rights, their most fundamental freedoms, at extraordinary personal risk. And of course, we saw the prominent deaths of young women that led to this.\n\nBut whats powerful about it is that this is this is grassroots, this is bottom up. This is a reflection of huge frustration and huge anger that so many in Iranian society have toward the direction of their country and toward their leadership, and theyre demanding change. This is not made in the U.S.A.; its not made anywhere else. To the extent that leaders in Iran try to point the fingers and somehow blame us, they are profoundly misreading and misunderstanding their own people and their own country, and thats going to be to their detriment.\n\nWhat can we do? First, we can stand and speak in solidarity with those who are simply trying to stand up for their own rights. Second, we can look at the different actors in Iran who are denying those rights and do what we can to penalize them for their actions. So we, for example, had sanctions that we put forward on the so-called morality police. And then maybe most important, and this goes directly in many ways to this community, we want to make sure that we are doing nothing that gets in the way of making sure that Iranians have the ability to the greatest extent possible of communicating with each other and connecting to the outside world, and that comes with technology. So weve issued some licenses to make sure that were not doing that, that people dont feel that our sanctions prohibit them from getting the technology that Iranians need to communicate with each other and with the world to the Iranian people.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: A little bit more activist this time than in 2012?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Each periods a little bit different.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: A little different, yeah. Right?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And I think I think our voice has been very clear not just our voice, our actions. And not just ours, countries around the world. But fundamentally, this is about the Iranian people. Its about their country. Its about their future. They will decide it. But we want to demonstrate in both practical as well as rhetorical ways our solidarity with them in this moment.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: So youre sitting at Stanford University in the middle of Silicon Valley. A long, long history between this place and the valley. And you are seeing and talking to the people who are really leading the technology revolutions. It goes back a long way here.\n\nSo in 2007 when I was secretary, I invited the then-Foreign Minister of Australia Alexander Downer here, and we have a little trip. And I got to got to drive an experimental car called a Tesla. (Laughter.) Alexander wouldnt get in it. He wasnt sure that he wanted well, I think it was probably the Australian secret service that didnt want him in an experimental car. But in any case, thats now a household name, maybe giving us answers to how to think about electric vehicles and climate change and the like.\n\nBut it says something very important about another part of the National Security Strategy, which its which says investing in our strengths. Very often, we get into what I call authoritarian envy. They build great airports. Democracy is so messy. But we forget that innovation has been from a place, the United States of America, that is the freest and most open. And so talk about investing in those strengths, protecting those strengths, and how that plays into the diplomacy that we must do but also the national security that we must achieve.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Its quite simply foundational, and let me say a couple of things about this. First, we go back to this proposition that were in a moment of intense competition to shape what comes next. Technology, innovation, entrepreneurship they are at the heart of that. This is how we are going to retool economies for the future. This is how were going to modernize militaries as necessary. This is, through technology, how we are quite literally reshaping peoples lives.\n\nAnd so it goes fundamentally to our national strength, but it also goes to a positive vision for the future that can be incredibly attractive for the United States around the world. Because as the technologies that are developed here and I was just at the SLAC this morning, which is extraordinary, even for someone who probably understood about 1 percent of what I was hearing this really does go to Americas most positive role in the world.\n\nAs were inventing; as youre inventing new technologies that are going to make sure that we can overcome disease and that we can actually strengthen global health and make sure that we dont have a repeat of COVID-19; as youre finding ways to make sure that we have sustainable, healthy food supplies for people around the world who so desperately need it and were living in a moment of intense food insecurity; as youre looking at ways to make sure that we actually develop the technology to ensure an energy future thats not dependent on fossil fuels; as youre looking at ways to make sure we have secure supply chains for technology going forward and good jobs for the future; if we continue to get that right, if we continue to lead on that, if we continue to be seen as a beacon for the world, that goes directly to our standing around the world, our strength around the world in ways that I cant even begin to adequately describe.\n\nSo for us it starts with investing in ourselves. If you look at the so-called American Century, the second part of the 20th century, we were making these investments in ourselves in the 50s, the 60s and 70s in education, in research and development, in basic science, in our infrastructure. And we moved away from that. And it is not to say at all that government should be the one making all of these investments. Were never going to compete with, for example, a Chinese model that dedicates all of its state resources to a particular part of the economy, to a particular part of the world. But what we can do and do more effectively is making sure were making these basic investments and then help catalyze, help facilitate, and ultimately help get out of the way for the private sector to really carry things forward.\n\nWeve had two, at least from where I sit, enormous successes in the last few months, starting with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, a product of extraordinary work over several years by Republicans and Democrats alike to make sure that we were renewing these investments in ourselves. A lot of the focus on chips has rightly gone to renewing our ability to manufacture chips, semiconductors here in the United States, having subcontracted that out many years ago. But there are huge investments in basic science, basic research and development that are contained in the CHIPS and Science Act and the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which has the biggest commitment to dealing effectively with climate change in the history of our country, more than $350 billion. And again, a lot of thats going to investments in our own innovative capacity.\n\nSo I think, Condi, that is at the foundation of our strength, and it shows why the connection between what happens here and what happens around the world is stronger than its ever been. Since we did CHIPS and since we did the IRA, I found the conversations that Im having with counterparts around the world have changed. Theres now this view that, wait a minute, maybe America is getting its act together and this is something that we want to be part of.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Thats the positive side of it, of course, that we invest in ourselves. But theres also a question thats constantly on the table about how much weve let out of the barn, so to speak, vis--vis the Chinese. They started down this road of indigenous development in some ways hasnt gone all that well. We keep reading about problems in their own high-end chip development and the like.\n\nSo how do you see the balance between investing in what we do here and making sure that it doesnt escape to there? And its particularly actually hard for a secretary of state, because one of the things that you dont want to do is make people declare loyalties. Thats the quickest way to lose friends, to say you either choose China or us. That doesnt work very well diplomatically.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We both know that very well.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Yes, right.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And what weve been saying is this: Were not asking people to choose; we want to give you a choice. And that means we have to have something to put on the table. A big part of what were trying to do besides the investment in ourselves, the other the flip side of that is trying to get greater alignment with allies, with partners, with a whole variety of countries who might not even neatly fit into the ally or partner category but who have an interest in making sure that theres a basic understanding about the rules and that everyone plays by them. So we spent a lot of time trying to re-energize and revitalize re-engage our alliances, our partnerships.\n\nWeve also been inventing or energizing some new ones new collections of countries that may be fit for purpose on specific issues; for example, making sure we have resilient supply chains, making sure that were on semiconductors investing together because so much of this work has to be collaborative as well, but also protecting. And in the case of the highest end semiconductors as you know very well, theres only a small number of countries that either are manufacturing the highest end semiconductors or making the tools to manufacture the highest end semiconductors. We want to make sure that we keep those where they need to be. So this alignment with other countries trying to all move in the same direction, trying to work together on shaping some of the norms, the standards, the rules by which technology is used, thats also profoundly part of our national interest and our strength around the world.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: This is a question that could solicit a rather boring answer, but this is a university, so its all right. Were accustomed to boring answers. (Laughter.) So you talked about standards. And maybe whats not fully understood is there are international efforts, international organizations where the standards are actually written\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thats right.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: for things like the internet, for questions about ships and supply chains. And the United States has always had a reputation of being fully uninterested completely uninterested in sending people to these conferences at the assistant secretary level to spend two years, three years writing standards.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thats right.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Are you interested in this?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We\n\nSECRETARY RICE: I have to admit: I wasnt. All right. So now. (Laughter.)\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Condi, I have walked out on standards in the biggest way, and we are flooding the zone for exactly that reason. Somewhere in the world on virtually any piece of technology that may be invented here, a group of people is sitting around a table in a windowless conference room writing the rules about how these are going to be used. And whoever writes the rules is going to have a powerful impact on the use of technology going forward.\n\nTo state the obvious, technology isnt inherently good or bad; the rules by which its used might be. And we want to make sure that, for example, when it comes to protecting privacy, when it comes to upholding human rights, when it comes to advancing our own security, but also enhancing our competitiveness, the rules reflect that. And as the saying goes, if youre not at the table, youre on the menu. We want to make sure that were at the table doing that. So, yeah, this is sometimes it seems mind-numbing.\n\nWe spent a lot of time making sure for example, there are competition for jobs in the international system, the folks who actually turn up at these meetings. Their elections, or their appointments, including in the entire United Nations system were spending a lot of time making sure that people that reflect our views and values are competing and winning those jobs. It really does make a difference. It does seem mind-numbing, but its incredible how at the end of the day thats going to shape the world as well.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: I should probably go back and apologize to my under secretary for economics who used to try to get me to pay attention. All right. So youve convinced me, because after all, this really is when we talk about the competition and going back to autocracy versus democracy, if these are used in a certain way, they will be used in different ways by autocracies. So you take something like facial recognition, which might simply make it possible for you to get through an airport more quickly if youre in the United States, and China has a very different way. So I applaud your interest in this mind-numbing part of it.\n\nHows it coming with others? You mentioned that we now are in the game, but when you think about particularly relations with the Europeans, weve not always had the greatest alignment with what you think should be our closest allies on things like privacy and the like. So can you talk a little bit about relations with the Europeans? Has it been affected by the extraordinary cooperation that were getting around Ukraine at this point? Someone said that Vladimir Putin had within a matter of months ended German pacifism and Swedish neutrality, which I think is probably true. But is it is it having an effect?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: It is remarkable the extent to which Putin has precipitated virtually everything he says he wants to prevent, particularly in terms of the so-called Western world sticking together and actually strengthening its cooperation across a whole variety of issues. I think we are making progress on this, because youre right, we have to find ways to make sure that on technology we are more aligned with other countries, starting in many cases with close partners in Europe as well as in Asia and then broadening out.\n\nWe have all of these different constellations, groupings, partnerships; one of them is something called the Technology and Trade Council with the European Union. And to put it in the simplest terms, this is a way of trying to make sure were actually all rowing in the same direction when it comes to these norms, these rules, these standards, but also a whole variety of other things. If we have export controls on the highest end technology that we think should not wind up in the hands of some of our competitors, including China, if were the only ones doing it and others are not abiding by them, then its not going to work. So we have to try to get alignment there, and we are.\n\nIf we want to make sure that when we have concerns about some of the investment thats coming into our own countries that may be going to critical industries, critical companies, ones that are that affect our security, we want to make sure that countries have the tools to look at those investments and decide whether this is something they want to go forward or not. Were working on those together with the European Union. Were thinking about critical supply chains and particularly for semiconductors. Weve seen what happened when these get disrupted. Were designing together an early warning system so that if we see a disruption anywhere in a supply chain for a critical component first of all going to semiconductors but broadening out to other technologies a flashing red light goes off and we can act on it together. All of these things are bringing us into closer alignment.\n\nNow, having said that, we have differences of view, differences of perspective just as we have within our own country, because obviously we dont have a unified technology policy in our own country that are always going to be there. We also have competition with some of our closest friends. We have were competing with Europeans, but we both fundamentally have the same interest in a system where people who play by the basic rules; where privacy is respected, even if we have different perspectives on the best way to do that; where our security is upheld, where human rights are respected, and where we can enhance our competitiveness. So the question is can we find ways to design those together, come into agreement. And then finally this: Competition when its fair, when its on a level playing field, when its a race to the top, is good. Thats what our own system is all about.\n\nSo for us its not saying, oh, we have to avoid competition with friends and partners and allies; its, on the contrary, making sure that together that competition is fair, its transparent, it has the rights of workers in mind, it has the environment in mind, it has protection of intellectual property in mind. And if we do that, then countries that dont abide by the same way of doing things will have to decide are they going to get into the race to the top with us and raise their own standards, raise their own game thats good for the world or not.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: So lets go now from out there to Foggy Bottom, to the place that you work, the State Department, and talk a little bit about how all of this is affecting the State Department. Let me just say that when I left the State Department, the there wasnt a smartphone for all intents and purposes, and I think we still when I got there still had Wang computers, believe it or not.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I remember those.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Youre all too young to even know what a Wang computer was, so it just gives you a sense. How in the world is a place that some 20 years ago still had Wang computers going to play in this world of technology? What does it mean for diplomacy and what does it mean for the State Department?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We have to be, and were doing everything we possibly can be, to really be fit for the purpose of this moment and the moments to come. And we both worked on this and looked at this anyone comes into these jobs and theyre looking at their own department or agency and trying to figure out what do I need to change, what makes sense. And we spent some time doing that. And I think we came to a couple of conclusions that are reflected in what were doing.\n\nFirst is youre only youre in these jobs for a finite period of time. Youre not going to youre not going to change everything and probably you shouldnt, so youve got to pick a handful of things that maybe you can make a difference on, get a start on, hopefully it continues when youre no longer there. Thats one.\n\nSecond, one of the biggest challenges we face is that the things that are really having an impact on the lives of everyone in this room and all of our fellow citizens are not necessarily the issues that the State Department has been front and center on or has the expertise on. And again, whether its climate, whether its health, whether its food insecurity, whether its energy, whether its economics, and whether it is cyberspace and digital policy, this has not been our bread and butter. And our bread and butter remains issues of war and peace, preventing conflict, making helping to end conflict where we can, making sure that the American people are secure through diplomacy. But each of these issues is directly tied to that.\n\nSo what weve done is were engaged in modernizing the department to make sure that were organized in a way and attract the talent in a way that allows us to play a leadership role on these issues. So, for example and youll Condi, youll appreciate this I think land record speed, we established a new bureau for cyber and digital policy in about six months time. And in fact, the ambassador running that, Nate Fick, who is actually a technologist (inaudible), is with us today. This is how we make sure that we have a place that the expertise can come to in the department and, ultimately, we can grow the expertise so that we can engage effectively on these issues.\n\nWere in the process of doing something similar on global health. One of the most extraordinary achievements in American foreign policy over the last 25 years is something called PEPFAR, something that President Bush and Condi initiated to deal with the HIV/AIDS as well as malaria and tuberculosis crisis. I dont think there has been a program in the recent history of the United States Government that has saved more lives than PEPFAR. Now we have an opportunity to make sure that coming out of COVID and inspired by what was done with PEPFAR we build an even better platform for dealing with questions of global health, and we want to make sure that the departments organized to do that, that we attract the talent.\n\nJohn Kerry is leading extraordinary efforts on climate, but we want to make sure that those are institutionalized so that, again, we are a leader. Because heres the thing and again, you all know this very well just as if were not leading and were not engaged, were going to have a problem because someone else will do it or no one will do it; if were not finding new ways to cooperate, to collaborate, to work with other countries on these issues, we simply cant get them done. Climate were 15 percent or so of global emissions. By definition, even if we did everything right at home, we have to figure out a way to deal with the other 85 percent. That means, among other things, diplomacy to bring others along.\n\nWhen were dealing with global health, when were dealing with COVID-19, we know that we are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain and that even, again, if we did everything right at home, if theres still an environment in which a new variant is going to pop up its head somewhere around the world and were not able to deal with that, were not going to be protecting our people. We have to find ways to collaborate and cooperate on that. And the technologies themselves, we are have to be the ones who are helping to shape the way that theyre used.\n\nAll of that is a function of diplomacy, and thats why I want to make sure that the department has the tools, has the organization, and has the talent to do it. So Im here to proselytize a little bit too. (Laughter.) We want you.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We need you at the department. This is an opportunity to pursue so many of the things that youve been studying, working on, and are passionate about, but to do it for those of you who are American for your country. And for me, at least, I found that and I Condi, I suspect you feel the same way there are so many extraordinary things you can do with your passions and your pursuits, and you can do them in a variety of different ways. And there are different rewards in the different ways that you do them. But at least for me, going to work every day literally and figuratively with the flag\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: behind my back, I cant even put a value on that. So to those of you who have an interest in actually doing public service, even for a short period of time and it seems like the State Department, what does that have to do with what Im interested in it has everything to do with it because virtually everything that so many of you are working on here actually has a direct application to what were trying to do around the world. And we hope that a few of you will join us.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Well, I was going to give you an opportunity for a recruitment pitch. I think we just got it. (Laughter.) But I want to join in. I do think that there is nothing like public service. Theres nothing like getting up in the morning and recognizing that youre going to work and try to do your very best for this extraordinary country that we inherited, that we continue to try to perfect. And I dont know about you, but whenever I would get off a plane that said \"The United States of America,\" I thought it was a pretty special moment. And so for all of you, particularly those out there who might have some technical skills that might be needed, consider it. Theres nothing quite like public service.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: With that, were going to open up for some Q&A, and I know well get plenty, so Im going to take the first question right here on the front.\n\nQUESTION: Hello. Thank you so much for your inspiring remarks, Secretary Blinken. Im curious about what you see as the merits of diplomacy through multilateral institutions such as the United Nations when their efficacy in enforcing treaties and maintaining the international order have proved to be a little bit precarious.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: And are you a student? Just to\n\nQUESTION: Yes. My names Mac. Im a senior majoring in political science.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Great, great.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So thank you for the question, and its one that we work on every single day. Look, these institutions, starting with the United Nations, are only as good or as bad as the countries that make up their membership. And so, yes, there are certain things that are inherent to the institutions themselves, and their leadership is really important. But fundamentally, the members have to help make them work or not, and youre absolutely right that weve seen in a number of them dysfunctions of one kind or another. The UN Security Council because of this renewed great power competition is often at loggerheads and as a result often paralyzed.\n\nBut at the same time, incredibly powerful things still happen. Just to give you one recent example, when Russia proceeded with its purported annexation of territory in Ukraine, we went to the United Nations and we tried at the Security Council to get a resolution reflecting that. Of course, it was vetoed by Russia, although we got a strong vote among the permanent and nonpermanent members of the council. But then we went to the General Assembly, to the entire body of the United Nations, and an extraordinary thing happened: 143 countries in the world stood up in opposition to the annexation, to the sham referenda that Russia had used as justification for the purported annexations. And that in and of itself is a powerful indicator of where the world actually is now on Russias aggression, something that the Russians have to factor into their thinking. So there is there are things that you can still do and do effectively.\n\nThe other thing Id say is this: Day in, day out, one of the things that gets lost in the UN system is there are different agencies that have their challenges but are doing things that in their absence either we would have to do directly ourselves or no one would do. International peacekeeping has been very troubled, but there are places in the world where the so-called Blue Helmets are. There are roughly I think 100,000 forces that are that make up UN peacekeeping. The United States has maybe a small handful. These are folks from other countries who are taking this on. If they werent doing it, we might have to, or wed have to let these crises go in ways that would make them even worse. And on things like health, on the environment, on education, these agencies are really doing important things.\n\nOur job is to try to make them do it better, more efficiently, more effectively, cut through the bureaucracy, cut through the corruption thats sometimes there, and work to try to make them a little bit better. But its a little bit like our own situation, which is theres a need to try to forge a more perfect union, and its something that were working on every day. But here, again, if were not actually there in the room, its probably not going to happen, which is why showing up, being participating in this, even with all the frustrations and even with all the criticism, I think makes a difference.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Yes. Going to go to the students here right here.\n\nQUESTION: Hi, Secretary Blinken. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. My name is Divya Ganesan, and Im an undergraduate student here studying computer science and political science. My question for you is that a lot of students in the room hope to be CEOs, software engineers, et cetera. How has diplomacy changed in a world where technology companies like Google and Facebook have both the network and soft power diplomacy of an actual country? And how should that affect the way that we care about diplomacy?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I think the single biggest change that Ive seen in the 30 or so years that Ive been doing this is precisely in the technology and information space, because one of the things to state the obvious thats happened is that a whole series of new actors have been empowered with technology and the ability in one way or another to control information in ways that were not the case before.\n\nAnd for those of us in government, this has profound, profound effects. Among other things, it means that if we cant find a way to align with these different actors who wield so much power, then we know that the best-laid plans will easily be disrupted. So we have a profound stake in trying to make sure that to the best of our ability were actually all rowing in the same direction. One of the reasons that not only am I here for a couple of days but we stood up this new bureau is to make sure that we have day-in, day-out connectivity with this entire ecosystem.\n\nAnd were going to disagree, and there are disagreements between the public and the private. Thats not going to go away. But where we can find ways to work through the disagreements and come out in a place where were trying to move things in the same direction, thats going to make our life easier; its going to make it easier for the policies that we pursue to actually take root and be implemented. We its in our self-interest, but its also the right thing to do to make sure that on any given problem we have all of the different stakeholders in on the takeoff and not just try and bring them in on the landing because the planes going to crash. But its challenging work, and sometimes theres a different interest at stake, and we have to find ways to reconcile those. Its going to be very imperfect, but what I can tell you is its more important than its ever been. Otherwise, were not going to make progress.\n\nSo but heres the other thing Ive heard, and Ive been coming out here for a long time. My strong sense is that for the multiplicity of motivations that people have for the work that theyre doing, so many people do want to be in one way or another part of something larger than themselves. They do want to be positive actors in solving problems that are afflicting our all of our citizens. And this place, maybe more than any on Earth, has been such an incredibly positive actor in doing that.\n\nNow, there are other things that from some perspectives are less positive. But I cant think of how we answer this challenge now of renewed competition for how the world is going to look over the next 25, 50, or 100 years if we are not doing it together with what is at the heart of our national strength. And that is whats coming out of this part of our country.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: In the blue shirt over here. Well take a couple quick please keep it brief because Im going to try to take one more question.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. My name is Jos Raz, and Im an undergraduate student studying political science and economics, and Im originally from Mexico. I would like to bring our attention to an area of the world that has not been discussed in this conversation, Latin America, my own home region, in which there is a lot going on the rise of influence in China in investment in countries like Ecuador and Argentina, not to mention drug violence in my own home country of Mexico. Given how close geographically Latin America is to the United States, I wanted to know what the policy of the United States should be in this region in coming years.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Few countries have a greater impact on each others day-in, day-out lives than the United States and Mexico. We know it. We feel it. We see it every single day. As it happens, we just had our senior Mexican counterparts in Washington just last week and where the Attorney General, the Secretary for Homeland Security Ali Mayorkas, myself, were working with them on something that we re-established, which is a security dialogue. How do we work together cooperatively to get a better grip on challenges to security in both of our countries that have been afflicting us for many years drugs coming this way, guns going that way, money fueling the whole thing. And if were not working on these things collaboratively, were not going to succeed.\n\nAnd I think the collaboration now with Mexico has been quite extraordinary. Migration we are living through a period that is we throw around the word \"historic.\" This is a historic period when it comes to migration. There are more people on the move around the planet, forcibly displaced in one way or another from their homes, than at any time in recorded history since weve been keeping statistics on this 100 million people. We feel that profoundly in our own hemisphere. In the Americas, we have Guatemalans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans all on the move for one reason or another. Weve been working very hard to create a shared sense of responsibility for dealing with migration in a safe, orderly, humane way. No single country can deal with this effectively alone. So thats very much part of our dialogue.\n\nBut theres also something thats very powerful, which is theres great potential in our own hemisphere to be an economic engine for growth for all of our countries; to have, for example, more integrated supply chains that make sure that we dont have the disruptions that weve experienced on things like computer chips. The lithium thats going to go into electric vehicle batteries well, for example, Mexico has a lot of that lithium. Finding ways to work on it together and then to have a resilient supply chain to get it to the places where the batteries are manufactured, thats something were working on. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity that I think thats being felt in a more integrated North America Mexico, the United States, Canada and a more integrated hemisphere.\n\nThe last thing Ill say is this, and it also goes back to the migration challenge that were facing. We have to find ways to be making smart investments in communities that people are leaving, because what we see is that the primary driver of migration in our own hemisphere there are different ones, but the most fundamental one is a lack of basic opportunity. And if you dont have that, if you cant put bread on the table for your family, youre going to try to figure something else out.\n\nAnd its not that people get up in the morning and say, gee, wouldnt it be fun today to put my life on the line, to put myself in the hands of a human trafficker, to leave my family behind, to leave my friends behind, to leave my culture and my language behind. It takes something very powerful to drive people to that decision. We have an ability to affect that decision over time in actually creating greater opportunity in different communities in our hemisphere. So thats something that were working on as well.\n\nBut the bottom line is this. Unless were doing it collaboratively, unless were working these issues together, its not going to happen. So it goes back, Condi, to what you were saying about sitting in these in these rooms with norms and standards. Were sitting in rooms throughout our hemisphere every day, engaged, sleeves rolled up, showing up, because thats ultimately how you build some trust, how you build some confidence, how you build actual partnership, and maybe start to get things done.\n\nBottom line is this. I think youre seeing governments throughout our hemisphere who are all facing the same challenge, which is: Can they deliver the basic things that their people need or aspire to? And if they cant theyre going to be gone. We just went through a cycle where a lot of governments in the hemisphere that happened to be, for example, from the from the right politically are out. We have new governments that are in that are more from the left. But its the same thing. Its less about ideology and its more about delivering for people. What the United States can offer, and it goes back to saying to people were not demanding that you choose, its were offering you a choice, is: Can we have the right kind of partnerships that make sense to them and help them deliver?\n\nChina, last thing Ill mention on this. If China has extraordinary resources that it can decide as a government to put into investments in our own hemisphere or around the world, thats a source of strength. But if those investments are done in a way where theyre piling debt on the countries that take them that it cant that cant be repaid, where workers are coming in from China instead of using local workers to do the projects, or the rights of the workers themselves on the projects are not being respected, where theres no consideration for the environment and the impact of a project on the environment, where corruption is part and parcel of whats being done thats going to alienate a lot of the recipients of Chinese largesse. If were offering a different model that, as I said, is more of a race to the top, thats going to be very attractive.\n\nBut for us, we have to find ways to actually mobilize and catalyze the private sector. Theres a lot of resource that sits on the sidelines. What government can do is be a catalyst, a guarantor, someone who says, yeah, this is a good place, this is a smart place, this is a reasonable place to make these kinds of investments. And then it becomes more of a win/win proposition for everyone.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Weve come to the hour.\n\nQUESTION: Can (inaudible) about Taiwan?\n\nSECRETARY RICE: All right. All right, certainly. You want to say something quick about Taiwan?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Sure.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: All right.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: What would you like me to say? (Laughter.)\n\nQUESTION: Hi, Secretary. Im the MBA first student from GSB. Im just wondering I know you are very time-limited maybe say something quick about like what is United States attitude toward Taiwan?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah, sure.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah. Or not so quick.\n\nQUESTION: I mean, like a lot of officials have\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Take your time to talk about Taiwan. We dont want to yes have an incident twice. Yes. (Applause.)\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So one of the things that weve worked on together in a variety of ways for years is our approach to Taiwan and the challenge that is inherent in dealing with the differences between Beijing and Taiwan. And a hallmark of the policy, going back decades through Republican and Democratic administrations, has been an insistence that the differences that exist need to be resolved peacefully. And actually, its been, up until recently, incredibly successful. I think its been managed well, in a way that has avoided conflict, that has also allowed people on Taiwan to really flourish, and benefit not just their own lives, but Taiwan has so much to contribute to the world that its doing every single day.\n\nWhats changed is this it goes back to something that Condi was saying at the very beginning there has been a change in the approach from Beijing toward Taiwan in recent years. And instead of sticking with the status quo that was established in a positive way, a fundamental decision that the status quo was no longer acceptable and that Beijing was determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline. And if peaceful means didnt work, then it would employ coercive means and possibly, if coercive means dont work, maybe forceful means to achieve its objectives. And that is what is profoundly disrupting the status quo and creating tremendous tensions.\n\nAnd this is a matter of concern not just to the United States because its been a central component of managing the relationship with China for so long, but its of profound concern to countries around the world. The amount of commercial traffic that goes through the straits every single day and has an impact on economies around the world is enormous. If that were to be disrupted as a result of a crisis, countries around world would suffer.\n\nThe last group of people I need to tell this is right here in this room. On semiconductors, if Taiwanese production were disrupted as a result of a crisis, you would have an economic crisis around the world. So theres a profound stake not just for us but for countries around the world in preserving peace and stability when it comes to Taiwan and the straits, and to making sure that the differences that exist are resolved peacefully. So thats why weve been so engaged on this.\n\nI hope that Beijing will come back to a place where it actually sees the merits in making sure that differences are peacefully resolved, that it doesnt try to force things through coercion, and even worse, through force. We are determined to make good on our commitments to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act and supporting their ability to defend themselves. Were also we also remain fundamentally committed to the \"one China\" policy as well. That hasnt changed. That wont change. But at the heart of that was a commitment to resolve these differences peacefully, and if thats changing, then that does offer, unfortunately, prospects for very challenging situations going forward.\n\nSECRETARY RICE: Thank you. And with that, we have come to the end of the hour. If you will join me in please thanking Secretary Blinken. (Applause.)\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you very much.",

Prior to the war, Ukraine and Russia combined accounted for nearly a third of global wheat supplies, with Ukraine being a top exporter of corn and wheat (7). The Initiative's blockage of grain exports contributes to soaring energy bills and food prices in Europe, increasing the risk of civil unrest and challenging European support for Ukraine amidst the difficult transition away from Russian energy (3).\n\nThe cessation of the grain deal not only risks a crisis of food affordability but also poses a potential crisis of food availability, as the absence of Ukrainian grain and fertilizers in the global market could jeopardize crops worldwide in the 2023 and 2024 planting seasons (4)(6). This disruption comes despite the deal's success in lowering global food prices and providing relief to vulnerable populations facing severe hunger (5). With inspections and shipments already lagging behind due to the deal's administrative challenges, the suspension further endangers the Initiative's role in alleviating food shortages and underscores the critical need for its continuation as a humanitarian effort (8)(10)."

The initiative has been critical in alleviating global food shortages by allowing over 9 million tons of grain to be exported from Ukraine since July, highlighting the importance of both nations as major global suppliers of wheat and corn (2,6). To navigate this impasse, the UN could engage in intensified diplomatic efforts with Moscow to address its security concerns and negotiate terms that might lead to the reinstatement of the safe corridor for cargo ships (5,7,8).\n\nAnother strategy could involve working with other countries, particularly in the West, to expedite the removal of obstacles that are currently blocking Russian grain and fertilizer exports, as urged by the UN Secretary-General (8). This approach could potentially create a more favorable environment for Moscow to reconsider its position on the grain deal. Additionally, the UN might leverage the constructive role of Turkey, which has facilitated talks between Ukraine and Russia and has shown a willingness to support de-escalation efforts without aligning with EU sanctions against Russia, to mediate further discussions (4). Ensuring the renewal and full implementation of the grain export initiative will require the UN to maintain open channels of communication with all parties involved and to underscore the critical humanitarian implications of the grain initiative for global food security (5,6,9)."

However, Russia's recent suspension of its participation in the agreement, citing an alleged Ukrainian drone attack, has called into question the possibility of maintaining these vital maritime routes for grain exports (2,4).",
                "summary": "Before the conflict, Ukraine was a significant exporter of wheat and corn, contributing substantially to global trade, but the conflict's maritime blockades in the Black Sea severely disrupted these exports (1). The Black Sea Grain Initiative brokered by the UN and Turkey succeeded in partially lifting the blockade, allowing the safe transit of grain, which has been critical in mitigating the global food crisis (1,3). However, the recent suspension of Russia's participation in this initiative, due to alleged Ukrainian drone attacks, has jeopardized the movement of grain and could lead to a reinstatement of the blockade, raising concerns about the continuity of grain exports from Ukraine (2,4). With the future of the Black Sea corridor in doubt, and the original agreement set to expire soon, finding alternative maritime routes has become imperative to sustain Ukrainian grain exports and support global food security (3,5).",
                "more_detailed": "The Black Sea Grain Initiative, a critical agreement brokered by the UN and Turkey, allowed Ukraine to resume grain exports through Black Sea ports, which had been blocked since the Russian invasion on February 24. The deal, which was set to expire on November 19, played a significant role in alleviating the global food crisis by enabling the export of over 9 million tons of Ukrainian grain, thereby contributing to the reduction of soaring global food prices (3,4,6,7,9). Despite the benefits, Russia suspended its participation in the initiative, citing an alleged Ukrainian drone attack on its Black Sea Fleet, creating uncertainty about the future of the grain corridor and potentially impacting global food supplies once again (2,4,5,10).\n\nIn response to the potential disruption of grain exports from Ukraine, there is a growing interest in establishing alternative maritime routes to mitigate the impact. Australia, for example, is poised to become a key wheat supplier as concerns over the future of the Black Sea grain corridor increase. The country is expected to see rising demand for its wheat, even though there are concerns about the crop's quality due to forecasted showers that might affect grain filling (8). However, with Ukrainian ports operating at only 25% to 30% of their capacity in the days preceding the suspension, the need for alternative routes is underscored (9). As the situation evolves, the international community may need to explore and secure such alternatives to ensure the continuity of grain exports and to support global food security (1,8,9)."

This interruption endangers the upcoming planting seasons, as it may lead to a scarcity of affordable fertilizers, potentially impacting food production and prices in 2023 and 2024, turning the crisis of affordability into one of availability (3,5). The geopolitical ramifications could intensify existing tensions, as countries already facing severe hunger may suffer further, potentially leading to increased political instability in regions dependent on these food imports (4). Additionally, the strain on food supply could have knock-on effects on energy markets, as countries may compete more aggressively for limited resources to secure their national interests (3,5).",

Before the conflict, Russia and Ukraine were prominent contributors to the world's grain market, and the blockade of Black Sea ports had previously hindered millions of tons of grain exports from Ukraine until the deal was brokered (7). The cessation of grain shipments risks exacerbating food scarcity, particularly in regions dependent on these exports for sustenance (4,7).\n\nFurthermore, the suspension might intensify geopolitical tensions, with potential ramifications for energy markets (1,2,4). The grain deal was pivotal in ensuring the availability of food and fertilizers at affordable prices before the planting season, which is crucial for global food production (3,5). This could lead to a \"crisis of availability\" if not addressed promptly, influencing energy and food linkages as countries may seek to secure resources amidst increasing competition and scarcity (3,5). The U.N. Secretary-General's delayed departure to the Arab League Summit highlights the urgency of the matter, signaling the gravity of the situation at the geopolitical level (6)."

Meanwhile, international reactions have been critical of Russia's suspension of the initiative. USAID Administrator Samantha Power expressed regret over Russia's decision, emphasizing the agreement's importance in lowering global food prices and providing relief to vulnerable populations facing severe hunger (7). The U.N.

Ukraine has denied the attack, saying that the Russians mishandled their own weapons.\n\nThe Russian declaration came one day after U.N. chief Antonio Guterres urged Russia and Ukraine to renew the grain export deal, which was scheduled to expire on Nov. 19. Guterres also urged other countries, mainly in the West, to expedite the removal of obstacles blocking Russian grain and fertilizer exports.\n\nThe U.N. chief said the grain deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July helps \"to cushion the suffering that this global cost-of-living crisis is inflicting on billions of people,\" his spokesman said.\n\nU.N. officials were in touch with Russian authorities over the announced suspension.\n\n\"It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people,\" said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry on Saturday accused British specialists of being involved in the alleged attack by drones on Russian ships in Crimea. Britain's Defense Ministry had no immediate comment on the claim.\n\n\"In connection with the actions of Ukrainian armed forces, led by British specialists, directed, among other things, against Russian ships that ensure the functioning of the humanitarian corridor in question (which cannot be qualified otherwise than as a terrorist attack), the Russian side cannot guarantee the safety of civilian dry cargo ships participating in the Black Sea initiative, and suspends its implementation from today for an indefinite period,\" the Russian statement said.\n\nUkraine's Ministry of Infrastructure said that Ukraine has never threatened the Black Sea grain corridor which \"is exclusively humanitarian in nature,\" and would continue to try to keep shipments going. It said since the first ship left the port of Odesa on Aug. 1, more than 9 million tons of food have been exported, including more than 5 million tons to African and Asian countries. As part of the U.N. World Food Program, it said, 190 thousand tons of wheat have been sent to countries where there is hunger.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused Russia of playing \"hunger games\" by imperiling global food shipments.\n\n\"We warned about Russia's plans to destroy the (grain agreement). Now, under false pretenses, Moscow is blocking the grain corridor that ensures food security for millions of people,\" he tweeted Saturday.\n\nThe head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Andriy Yermak, denounced the suspension as part of Russia's \"primitive blackmail.\"\n\nTurkish officials said they haven't received any official notice yet of the deal's suspension.\n\nRussia also requested a meeting of the U.N. Security Council for Monday because of the alleged attack on the Black Sea Fleet and the security of the grain corridor, said Dmitry Polyansky, Russia's first deputy representative to the U.N. It would be the fourth U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine-related issues that Russia has called since Tuesday.\n\nRussia's agriculture minister said Moscow stands ready to \"fully replace Ukrainian grain and deliver supplies at affordable prices to all interested countries.\" In remarks carried by the state Rossiya 24 TV channel, Dmitry Patrushev said Moscow was prepared to \"supply up to 500,000 tons of grain to the poorest countries free of charge in the next four months,\" with the help of Turkey.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Ukraine and Russia offered differing versions on the Crimea drone attack in which at least one Russian ship suffered damage in Sevastopol, the port on the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said a minesweeper had \"minor damage\" during an alleged pre-dawn Ukrainian attack on navy and civilian vessels docked in Sevastopol, which hosts the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. The ministry claimed Russian forces had \"repelled\" 16 attacking drones.\n\nThe governor of the Sevastopol region, Mikhail Razvozhaev, claimed the port saw a \"massive attack\" by air and sea drones. He provided no evidence, saying all video from the area would be seized for security reasons.\n\nBut an adviser to Ukraine's Interior Ministry claimed that \"careless handling of explosives\" had caused blasts on four warships in Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Anton Gerashchenko wrote on Telegram that the vessels included a frigate, a landing ship and a ship that carried cruise missiles used in a deadly July attack on a western Ukrainian city.\n\nIn other developments on Saturday, Russian troops moved large numbers of sick and wounded comrades from hospitals in Ukraine's southern Kherson region and stripped the facilities of medical equipment, Ukrainian officials said as their forces fought to retake the province.\n\nKremlin-installed authorities in the mostly Russian-occupied region have urged civilians to leave the city of Kherson, the region's capital and reportedly joined the tens of thousands who fled to other Russia-held areas.\n\n\"The so-called evacuation of invaders from the temporarily occupied territory of the Kherson region, including from medical institutions, continues,\" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russians were \"dismantling the entire health care system\" in Kherson and other occupied areas.\n\n\"The occupiers have decided to close medical institutions in the cities, take away equipment, ambulances. just everything,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nKherson is one of four regions in Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed last month and where he subsequently declared martial law. The others are Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nAs Kyiv's forces sought gains in the south, Russia kept up its shelling and missile attacks in the country's east. Three more civilians died and eight more were wounded in the Donetsk region, a front-line hotspot as Russian soldiers try to capture the city of Bakhmut, an important target in Russia's stalled eastern offensive.\n\nRussian shelling also hit an industrial building in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region. Around a quarter of the region including its capital remains under Ukrainian control.\n\nIn the latest prisoner exchange, 50 Ukrainian soldiers, including two former defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, and two civilians were released Saturday as part of a swap with Russia, according to Yermak. Russia received 50 Russian soldiers.",

She served as a primary point of contact for the U.K.s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, famously blaming Putin directly for the emerging global energy and food crises.\n\nRebekah Koffler, the president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting and a former DIA intelligence officer, told Fox News Digital that it would be no surprise that Russia might target Truss - and no surprise that they would have succeeded.\n\n\"Its a standard operating procedure for Russian intelligence operatives to try and intercept communications of prominent foreign leaders that are high value targets for them,\" Koffler said. \"The goal is either to exfiltrate intelligence or to embarrass a foreign official by leaking hacked content, if the Russians find something juicy, in terms of personal data.\"\n\nNEW UK PRIME MINISTER WON'T ATTEND COP27 CLIMATE SUMMIT IN EGYPT DUE TO PRESSING DOMESTIC NEEDS\n\nKoffler mentioned previous instances in which Russia was able to flex its hacking capabilities, such as when Russians posted a recording of a phone call they intercepted between U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt and Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland in which they made disparaging comments about the European Union. She also claimed that Russians freely read President Barack Obama's unclassified emails.\n\n\"If you are a prominent official or a business leader, your phone contains so much data emails, pictures, voicemails that can be of value to hostile intelligence services,\" Koffler explained. \"The Russians are highly skilled at hacking and are always on the hunt for valuable secrets or what they call \"kompromat\" - compromising information. Cyber hacking an enormous threat for government and business leaders, especially when they travel outside their home country.\"\n\nOne such message to Kwarteng included criticism of Johnson, which the Government worried could turn into some form of blackmail.\n\nOther messages may have included details about arms shipments to Ukraine.\n\nPUTIN WILL RELY ON HIS PERSONAL CHEF AND WAGNER GROUP HEAD TO MANAGE THE NEXT PHASE OF WAR\n\nA source with knowledge of the alleged incident told the Mail that the initial revelation caused \"absolute pandemonium.\"\n\n\"It is not a great look for the intelligence services if the Foreign Secretary's phone can be so easily plundered for embarrassing personal messages by agents presumed to be working for Putin's Russia,\" the individual said. As much as a years worth of messages may have been downloaded from Trusss phone.\n\nShe may have also been so worried about the breach that she was unable to sleep during the time and feared that new of the hack would undermine her campaign for party leader.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense deferred comment to the State Department, who did not respond by time of publication.",

All times EDT.\n\n10:28 p.m.:\n\n9:22 p.m.: Ukraine's state energy company responded to Saturdays missile strikes by Russia on key energy infrastructure sites by announcing that rolling blackouts would be imposed in Kyiv and 10 Ukrainian regions in order to stabilize the situation, The Associated Press reported.\n\nIn a Facebook post Saturday, Ukrenergo accused Russia of attacking \"energy facilities within the principal networks of the western regions of Ukraine.\" It claimed that the scale of destruction has been comparable to the fallout from Moscow's first coordinated attack on the Ukrainian energy grid, Oct. 10-12.\n\nBoth Ukrenergo and officials in Kyiv have been urging Ukrainians to conserve energy.\n\nEarlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on consumers to curb their power use between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. daily and avoid using energy-guzzling appliances such as electric heaters.\n\nOver the past two weeks, Moscow has increased its attacks on key civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. Officials said about 40% of the country's electric power system has been severely damaged.\n\n8:10 p.m.: The Ukrainian presidential office said in its Saturday statement that five explosive-laden drones were downed in the central Cherkasy region southeast of Kyiv, according to The Associated Press.\n\nUkraine's top diplomat said Saturday's attacks were proof that Ukraine needed new Western-reinforced air defense systems \"without a minute of delay.\"\n\n\"Air defense saves lives,\" Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office, said on Telegram Saturday that almost 1.4 million households lost power as a result of the strikes. He said some 672,000 homes in the western Khmelnytskyi region were affected, while a further 242,000 suffered outages in the central Cherkasy province.\n\n7:13 p.m.: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says the use of a nuclear weapon by Russia in the war in Ukraine would be considered an \"act of hostility against humanity,\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.\n\n\"Russia's act of threatening the use of nuclear weapons is a serious threat to the peace and security of the international community and absolutely unacceptable,\" Kishida said Saturday during a visit to Australia.\n\nIn May next year, Kishida is expected to host leaders from the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Hiroshima, where a U.S. nuclear bomb was dropped August 6, 1945, resulting in the deaths of 140,000 people.\n\nThe Japanese city of Nagasaki was hit three days later.\n\nJapan remains the only country to have ever been hit with a nuclear bomb.\n\nKishida said the 77-year period of no nuclear weapons use \"must not be ended.\"\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February, President Putin has made several thinly veiled threats about his willingness to deploy tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n6:19 p.m.: The newborn peeking out of a pink blanket in a hospital on the north bank of Ukraine's Dnieper River may never see her grandparents back home in the Russian-occupied south, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\nHer mother fled for the relative safety of government-held Zaporizhzhia to make sure the baby was born a citizen of the country the Russians invaded eight months ago.\n\nBut her grandparents stayed behind and out of reach on the opposite side of the shore.\n\n\"It may be too late for them to get out,\" 19-year-old Anastasia Skachko lamented while stealing glances at her still-nameless girl. \"I don't even want them to try. The roads are all either mined or getting shelled.\"\n\n5:27 p.m.: Spain said Saturday that it would send 14 fighter jets to Bulgaria and Romania to bolster NATO's eastern flank, Agence Frace-Presse reported, as the defense alliance strengthens its deterrence capacity following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMadrid will send six Eurofighter jets and 130 soldiers to Bulgaria between mid-November and early December to train local forces, the Spanish defense ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt added that a further deployment will see eight F18M fighter jets and 130 air force personnel sent to Romania between December and March 2023 as part of NATO's \"reaction and deterrence\" strategy.\n\nA long-range aerial surveillance radar has also been deployed in Romania since October 17 and could remain until late June 2023, the statement said.\n\n4:11 p.m.: In Romania, protesters blew horns and banged drums to voice their dismay over the rising cost of living. People across France took to the streets to demand pay increases that keep pace with inflation. Czech demonstrators rallied against government handling of the energy crisis. British railway staff and German pilots held strikes to push for better pay as prices rise.\n\nAcross Europe, soaring inflation is behind a wave of protests and strikes that underscores growing discontent with the spiraling cost of living and threatens to unleash political turmoil, The Associated Press reports.\n\nEuropeans have seen their energy bills and food prices soar because of Russias war in Ukraine. The fallout from the war has sharply raised the risk of civil unrest in Europe, according to risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.\n\nEuropean leaders have strongly supported Ukraine, sending the country weapons and pledging or being forced to wean their economies off cheap Russian oil and natural gas, but the transition hasnt been easy and threatens to erode public support.\n\n\"Theres no quick fix to the energy crisis,\" said Torbjorn Soltvedt, an analyst at Verisk Maplecroft. \"And if anything, inflation looks like it might be worse next year than it has been this year.\"\n\n3:17 p.m.: Ukrainian forces are using Soviet-era T-64B tanks to defend the area around the key city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Russian troops have been making slow but steady progress in the area. RFE/RL's Maryan Kushnir followed a tank crew from Ukraine's 30th Mechanized Brigade as it targeted Russian logistical supplies like fuel and ammunition. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report:\n\n2:23 p.m.: Iran has criticized a call by France, Germany, and Britain for the United Nations to investigate accusations that Russia has used Iranian-made drones to attack Ukraine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said October 22 the initiative announced the previous day by the so-called E-3 group of countries was \"false and baseless\" and that it was \"strongly rejected and condemned.\"\n\nUkraine says Russia has struck its infrastructure with Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones that cruise toward their target and explode on impact.\n\nBoth Iran and Russia have denied the accusations.\n\nIn a letter signed by their U.N. envoys and seen by Reuters, the three European countries backed Ukraine's call October 17 for a U.N. probe, arguing that the drone use breached a U.N. Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 2231 endorsing the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers.\n\n1:18 p.m.: Many Ukrainians risk their lives to save pets and domestic animals.\n\nDogs, cats, and even goats have been evacuated from combat zones in Ukraine, including a dog called Crimea that was the sole survivor of a Russian missile attack on a family home in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n12:08 p.m.: Pro-Russian authorities in Ukraine's southern Kherson region, which Moscow claims to have annexed, Saturday urged residents of the region's eponymous main city to leave \"immediately\" in the face of Kyiv's advancing counter-offensive, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\n\"Due to the tense situation on the front, the increased danger of mass shelling of the city and the threat of terrorist attacks, all civilians must immediately leave the city and cross to the left bank of the Dnieper river,\" the region's pro-Russian authorities said on social media.\n\n11:12 a.m.:\n\n10:13 a.m.: Finnish officials will arrive in Ankara on Tuesday to discuss their countrys bid to join NATO, Turkeys state-run news agency reported Saturday, according to The Associated Press.\n\nA delegation from Finlands Justice Ministry will meet Kasim Cicek, the head of foreign relations at the Turkish Ministry of Justice, Anadolu Agency said. The talks will focus on the extradition of individuals Turkey regards as terrorists, the report added.\n\nBoth Finland and its neighbor Sweden applied for membership in the defense alliance in the wake of Russias February invasion of Ukraine, abandoning long-standing policies of military nonalignment. Becoming a NATO member requires the unanimous support of all current members, including Turkey.\n\nTurkey has threatened to block the process unless Finland and Sweden meet its demands. In particular, Ankara wants them to crack down on people it considers terrorists, such as supporters of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, and members of a group said to have orchestrated a failed coup in 2016.\n\n9:16 a.m.: In late June 2019, a Russian man named Yury Orekhov met in a European hotel with a businessman representing a California-based company involved in consulting and logistics. Orekhov, the co-owner of a German industrial equipment and commodities trading company, told the businessman that he wanted to buy U.S. components to be used in a Russian Sukhoi fighter jet.\n\nAccording to a U.S. federal indictment unsealed this week, Orekhov allegedly told the unnamed businessman that the paperwork would have to be falsified to show a fake Malaysian company was the purchaser, in order avoid U.S. export restrictions, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.\n\nNot long after, a Russian woman who worked for Orekhov followed up with the businessman, requesting help to buy sensitive military technologies including \"tactical air navigation interrogators and multi-mode receivers, radiation-hardened, military-grade two-terminal temperature transducers.\"\n\nThe sale never went through, according to U.S. prosecutors -- but others arranged by Orekhovs company did, including \"a variety of sensitive, military-grade technologies in five transactions totaling over $250,000\" purchased from a New York company between 2018 and 2020.\n\n8:20 a.m.: Hundreds of thousands of people in central and western Ukraine woke up on Saturday to power outages and periodic bursts of gunfire, as Ukrainian air defense tried to shoot down drones and incoming missiles, The Associated Press reported.\n\nRussia has intensified its strikes on power stations, water supply systems and other key infrastructure across the country, the latest phase of the war as it nears the eight-month mark.\n\nUkraine's air force said in a statement Saturday that Russia had launched \"a massive missile attack\" targeting \"critical infrastructure,\" hours after air raid sirens blared across the country. It said that it had downed 18 out of 33 cruise missiles launched from air and sea.\n\n\"Several rockets\" targeting the capital were shot down on Saturday morning, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging service.\n\n7:51 a.m.:\n\n5:34 a.m.: Russian soccer clubs will challenge FIFA at sports highest court next month over emergency rules that let players suspend their contracts and leave since the countrys invasion of Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport set Nov. 21 for an appeal hearing brought against FIFA by eight clubs including Russian champion Zenit St. Petersburg.\n\nThe interim contract rules first applied by FIFA in March and renewed in June let players and coaches leave on loan to join clubs in other countries. Russian clubs are suspended from European competitions this season but the national league has continued.\n\nThe chief executive of Zenit, Alexander Medvedev, said in June the rules amounted to \"robbery\" and did not compensate clubs for players that left.\n\nUkrainian clubs like Shakhtar Donetsk also objected, and said agents tried to exploit uncertainty around its future and take contracted players for free.\n\n4:37 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said Russian forces continue to reinforce crossing points over the Dnipro River, and have completed a barge bridge alongside the damaged Antonovskiy bridge in Kherson. It's likely the first time in decades the Russian military has needed to utilize this kind of bridge. If the barge bridge sustains damage, the update said, it is almost certain Russia will seek to repair or replace damaged sections quickly, as their forces and crossing points over the Dnipro river come under increasing pressure in Kherson.\n\n3:18 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that The Russian withdrawal from western Kherson Oblast has begun. Russian forces likely intend to continue that withdrawal over the next several weeks but may struggle to withdraw in good order if Ukrainian forces choose to attack.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is demonstrably setting conditions for Russia to continue a protracted war in Ukraine, not for a negotiated settlement or offramp. Meanwhile, Russian and Ukrainian sources reported fighting northeast of Kharkiv City along the international border, on the Svatove-Kreminna frontline, and west of Lysychansk.\n\n1:43 a.m.: Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko insisted on Friday that Minsk was not preparing to enter the Ukraine conflict, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThe autocratic leader, a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin, was on a visit to inspect Belarus-made drones, which he said had the potential to cover the border with Ukraine.\n\n\"It would not be desirable for these (drones) to be used in Ukraine,\" the 68-year-old Lukashenko said. \"After all, (Ukrainians) are our people.\"\n\nOn Friday he insisted Minsk did not want to become involved in any war.\n\n\"We are not planning to go anywhere. There is no war as of today. We do not need it,\" he said.\n\n12:02 a.m.: A Russian employee of Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) was killed after being mobilized to fight against Ukraine, despite his bank writing to the draft office seeking an exemption, his lawyer told Reuters on Friday.\n\nTimur Izmailov, 33, an IT specialist at Raiffeisen's Russian operations in Moscow, was conscripted on Sept. 23, two days after President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization order, and died on Oct. 13 after being hit by mortar fire, his lawyer Konstantin Yerokhin said.\n\nCertain workers are exempt from the draft, including commercial bank employees to ensure the stability of the banking system.\n\nBut when Izmailov went to his recruitment office to explain that he was entitled to deferment, \"The military commissar told him he was not on the deferment list, so he had to be mobilized,\" Yerokhin said.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

The update on the substantial business relocation amid the economic backlash against Moscow for its war in Ukraine comes amid a substantial relocation of Russian men, sometimes accompanied by families, to Kazakhstan in response to Vladimir Putins military mobilisation to secure more troops for the war. In the weeks after the mobilisation began in September, Kazakh officials spoke of around 200,000 Russians fleeing to Kazakhstan to avoid the call-up.\n\nHow many have stayed and how many have moved on to third countries is unclear. Djoomart Otorbaev, a former prime minister of Kyrgyzstan, and author of the forthcoming \"Central Asias Economic Rebirth in the Shadow of the New Great Game\", addressed this and other related issues in a Project Syndicate article published by The Korea Herald on October 20, writing: \"Bishkeks residents have been confronted with an unusual sight these past few weeks. The streets of Kyrgyzstans capital are teeming with tens of thousands of educated men with European featuresRussian citizens fleeing President Vladimir Putins partial mobilization of 300,000 reservists to fight his war against Ukraine.\"\n\nAssessing the substantial movement of Russian companies to Kazakhstan, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said that officials in the country's commercial capital, Almaty, should settle the relocated companies.\n\n\"This will significantly help the economy of our country. Discuss this with the government and the companies,\" Tokayev told Almaty city officials.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, over a thousand international firms stopped or suspended their operations in Russia, while 320 international firms fully exited the Russian market.\n\nKazakhstans deputy foreign minister Roman Vasilenko told German newspaper Die Welt in March that companies exiting Russia due to consequences of the war in Ukraine were welcome to move production to Kazakhstan.\n\nOn July 14, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev proposed creating \"favourable conditions\" for approximately 1,000 foreign firms that have halted operations in Russia.\n\n\"Were witnessing a global struggle for investment capital. One out of two of the nearly 1,400 major foreign companies have suspended operations or left the Russian market entirely,\" he said at a government session.\n\n\"The government should create favourable conditions for their relocation to Kazakhstan. This will give us a good opportunity to increase production,\" he added.\n\nThe latest figures on firms migrating to Kazakhstan appear to be in line with the countrys earlier announced intentions.\n\nTens of thousands of the Russians who fled Putin;s mobilisation may have moved on from Kazakhstan to fellow Central Asian states Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Among those choosing self-exile, are many skilled information technology workers whom officials in all three countries regard as \"prize catches\" as they seek to build up local IT industries.",

Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nAustralia's wheat harvest is set to be in full swing from the week beginning Oct. 31 amid concerns hovering over the extension of the so-called \"grain corridor\" in the Black Sea, a major wheat-supplying region.\n\nAustralia is headed for near-record wheat production in the marketing year 2022-23 (October-September). Both the US Department of Agriculture and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences have projected output at 34 million mt and 32.2 million mt, respectively, reflecting the second-highest production against last year's record harvest of 36.3 million mt.\n\nAlthough trade participants believe that Australian wheat will be crucial for the global supply chain if the Black Sea grain corridor expires in November, there are concerns about whether wheat supply from the country will be able to cover the demand for milling wheat in key importers.\n\nPersistent showers over key wheat-growing regions in Australia have raised concerns over the quality of the crop, with heavy showers usually leading to an increase in moisture level in wheat and diluting its protein content.\n\n\"Australia has received excessive showers over the past few weeks, which may have been due to the La Nina for the third consecutive year,\" a trader based in Canberra said.\n\n\"Parts of New South Wales are still receiving heavy showers which have led to an increase in moisture level in the crop,\" a trader based in Singapore said.\n\n\"The key concern in the eastern states (including New South Wales) is the risk of rain during harvest, resulting in downgraded grain quality,\" the US Department of Agriculture said.\n\nNew South Wales is the second-largest producer of wheat in Australia, followed by Western Australia.\n\nApart from New South Wales, excessive rainfall during the past few weeks has delayed harvest in Western Australia too, sources said.\n\n\"The forecast of showers over parts of Western Australia has elevated the risk of poor grain filling,\" a Singapore-based trader said.\n\nHowever, despite the concerns over the quality of the crop, Australia is likely to become a key supplier of wheat as doubts cloud the future of the Black Sea grain corridor, according to sources.\n\nThe safe passage deal signed between Russia and Ukraine on July 22, to resume exports through the Black Sea, is supposed to expire on Nov. 19.\n\nAustralian wheat demand seen growing\n\nWith the concerns mounting over the grain corridor agreement, demand for Australian wheat has started growing.\n\nAsian buyers, who have been looking to purchase Black Sea wheat, are now turning to Australian feed wheat, sources said.\n\nThe 120-day UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative had also laid the way for exports of corn.\n\nWithout the prospect of Ukraine wheat and corn exports, buyers are likely to turn to Australian supplies, sources said.\n\nThe USDA has scaled up its projection for Australia's wheat exports in MY 2022-23 to 26 million mt in October, up from 24 million mt seen six months ago.\n\nHowever, with higher-than-average rainfalls, particularly in the south and eastern regions, affecting the protein content of the crop, significant volumes of lower quality will probably find homes in the animal feed industry, according to market expectations.\n\nAdditionally, logistics may pose a challenge as January shipping slots for Australian exports are limited which would elevate prices, sources said.\n\nCBH boosts shipping capacity\n\nAustralia's CBH Operations will release another 600,000 mt of grain shipping capacity at Kwinana on improved inland logistics, S&P Global Commodity Insights reported earlier.\n\nCBH was due to allow bidding on their portal on Oct. 26 but due to technical issues it has delayed the release, trading sources said, adding that when the bidding would resume has not been announced yet. However, additional slots for 10 ships with each 60,000 mt will be available for the first half of every month from December 2022 to July 2023 and the second half of the month for August and September 2023, according to CBH's website.\n\nThis is not the first time CBH added capacity when export demand is strong. In March 2022, CBH released another 500,000 mt of shipping capacity to meet a surge in demand following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPlatts, part of S&P Global, assessed APW wheat FOB Australia at $370/mt Oct. 21, up 12% from the same time last year.",

It said one vessel had received minor damage.\n\nHours later, a statement by the foreign ministry in Moscow said: \"The Russian side cannot guarantee the safety of civilian dry cargo ships participating in the 'Black Sea Initiative', and suspends its implementation from today for an indefinite period.\"\n\nIt said the move was \"in connection with the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces, which were led by British specialists\" and that these actions \"were directed... against Russian ships that ensured the functioning of the said humanitarian corridor\".\n\nMoscow claimed 16 aerial and maritime drones were destroyed, and that only a minesweeper had sustained damage.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether that is indeed the case, with reports suggesting that the flagship frigate was also hit. Claims and counterclaims have become part of this war.\n\nPresident Zelensky said Russia's decision was not one that had been made today, but in September \"when it blocked the movement of ships with our food produce\".\n\n\"Why is it that some handful of individuals somewhere in the Kremlin can decide whether there will be food on the tables of people in Egypt or in Bangladesh?\" he added.\n\nMr Zelensky said a strong international response was needed from both the UN and the world's twenty largest economies.\n\nThe White House said Russia was \"weaponising food\".\n\nA UN spokesman said the organisation, which brokered the deal with Turkey, was in touch with Moscow.\n\nIt added that it was \"vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative\", which it said was a critical humanitarian effort improving access to food for millions of people around the world.\n\nThe agreement allowed Ukraine to resume its Black Sea grain exports, which had been blocked when Russia invaded the country.\n\nIt was personally negotiated by the UN secretary general and celebrated as a major diplomatic victory that helped ease a global food crisis.\n\nBut Russia has complained that its own exports are still hindered, and had previously suggested it might not renew the deal.\n\nReuters\n\nThe Russian Navy at the entrance to the port city of Sevastopol in 2014\n\nIn recent days, Kyiv has accused Moscow of deliberately delaying the passage of ships, creating a queue of more than 170 vessels.\n\nSaturday's drone attack comes as Ukrainian troops successfully retake territory occupied by Russian troops since they launched their invasion on 24 February.\n\nRussia has responded by launching large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly on the country's energy grid.\n\nCrimea was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and is extremely symbolic for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn recent weeks, several attacks have hit the peninsula, where the Russian army has built up a large presence.\n\nSevastopol is the largest city in the region and home to Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-installed governor of the city, said Russia's navy had repelled the latest attack - the \"most massive\" on the city since February.\n\nHe said that all unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) had been shot down and no civilian infrastructure had been damaged.\n\nThe Ukrainian government rarely comments on claims made by Russian authorities in Crimea, although senior officials often celebrate incidents on the peninsula.\n\nUkraine has vowed to recapture all territory that is under Russian occupation, including Crimea, which has been a key base for President Putin's forces during the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWithout providing any evidence, the Russian defence ministry also accused British navy specialists of helping Ukrainian forces prepare the attack on Saturday morning.\n\nIt also said the same unit was \"involved in plotting, organising, and implementation of the terrorist attack in the Baltic Sea on 26 September this year to blow up the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines\".\n\nIn its reply, the MoD said: \"To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.\n\n\"This invented story, says more about arguments going on inside the Russian government than it does about the west.\"\n\nFrance also said it did not believe the Russian allegations.\n\nIn recent days, Russia has been engaged in what US and Ukrainian officials describe as a disinformation campaign, with unsubstantiated claims that Kyiv is preparing to use a radioactive dirty bomb, or even biological mosquitoes.\n\nRussia's Black Sea Fleet was previously targeted in April this year by Ukrainian forces when its flagship warship, the Moskva, was sunk. The 510-crew missile cruiser had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, and its sinking was a major symbolic and military blow.\n\nEarlier this month, a blast occurred on the Crimean bridge - a pivotal symbol of Russia's annexation of Crimea.",

                "cc_text": "Iron ore is the most important export earner for Australia. Between 2000 and 2020, Australia exported more than $620 billion worth of iron ore to China.[7] In April 2021, the spot price reached the record high of $238 per ton. For every $10 increase in iron ore price, the Australian federal governments tax receipts are boosted by $2 billion.[8]\n\nChinas purchases of Australian iron ore have taken on a strategic dimension at a time of geopolitical competition. In the former treasurer Joe Hockeys memoir, he recounts how then president Barack Obama asked former prime minister Tony Abbott to stop selling iron ore to China. Hockey complained furiously in the book, writing: \"That is ridiculous. What was the Americans plan for Australia? Were they going to buy all our iron ore? Those exports were critical, both for the economy and for the federal and Western Australian budgets.\"[9]\n\nExports of iron ore are critical to Australias political economy. In March 2022, the Western Australian government announced a projected budget surplus of $5.7 billion, driven by surging iron ore royalties. Western Australia earned about $10 billion in royalties in the 202122 financial year, compared to just $868 million in 200607.[10] Three out of the ten richest Australians also owe their fortunes to iron ore, including Gina Rinehart and Andrew Forrest. Clive Palmer, the seventh-ranked billionaire, is collecting $500 million a year in iron ore mining royalties from his estranged Chinese partner, the state-owned CITIC.[11]\n\nSurging commodities prices helped the Australian economy recover to pre-Covid levels of output during the first quarter of 2021, joining a rare group of five other countries including China. The terms of trade which measures the relative prices of exports and imports rose 7.4 per cent between January and March 2021 and drove the countrys current account surplus to a record high of $18.3 billion.\n\nDespite trade measures against a spectrum of Australian export sectors, the iron ore industry remains untouched by the current standoff. While ships carrying Australian coal were left stranded in the seas off the Chinese coast, Chinese workers could not unload the Pilbara cargoes fast enough.\n\nWhy is Australias most important export sector being spared from Beijings trade coercion? And how resilient is the industry in the medium term?\n\nDiversity of supply\n\n1. Limited global supply\n\nThe answer lies in the duopolistic nature of the global seaborne iron ore trade market. In 2020, China imported 1.1 billion tons of iron ore, and 66 per cent came from Australia. Brazil was the second-largest supplier at 21 per cent, and South Africa a distant third with 3.2 per cent of the market.[12]\n\nDuring the same year, Australia exported 886 million tons of iron ore and China was by far the largest market, making up 82.9 per cent of total exports. Japan and South Korea, the second- and third-largest importers, accounted for 6.6 per cent and 6.0 per cent respectively.\n\nBy comparison, Australias largest competitor, Brazil, shipped 334 million tons of iron ore out of the country and 72 per cent went to China. The key advantage for Australian exporters is geography. It takes on average 18.7 days for Australian bulk carriers to arrive in China and 52.7 days for ships carrying Brazilian ores. This advantage is clearly reflected in onshore price: the average price for Australian ore was $100 per ton, and $109 per ton for Brazilian ore. The Australian mining industry also benefits from well-functioning public institutions and an openness to foreign investment, which have helped make it a technological leader in the sector.\n\nChina has been helping Brazil build a fleet of ultra-large bulk carriers (\"Valemax\"), with a capacity of 400,000 tons, to help Vale, the state-owned Brazilian mining giant, reduce its transport disadvantage. Industry sources have suggested that Valemax can reduce transport costs by 25 per cent.\n\nIn commissioning ever larger and higher-capacity ships to drive down the cost of transport, China is taking a leaf out of Japans playbook from the 1960s and 1970s.[13] However, there is no reason that such ships could not be used to transport Australian ore, thus diminishing any advantage that might accrue to Brazil.\n\nAustralian dominance in the seaborne market and especially for the Chinese market was achieved only in the last decade. Before the financial crisis in 2008, Brazilian iron ore exports to China closely tracked those of Australia. The gap started to widen during the last decade. In 2020, Australian exports to China were three times that of Brazil.[14]\n\nThe mismanagement of Covid-19 in Brazil and the collapse of tailings dams at Vale, the worlds largest producer, severely impacted Brazils production capacity at precisely the moment when SinoAustralian relations were deteriorating. Vale produced 385 million tons of iron ore in 2018. Output declined 21 per cent to 302 million tons a year later.[15] In 2020, the company only managed to produce 300.4 million tons, even less than the disastrous year of 2019.\n\nThe company says it is confident of resuming 400 million tons production at the end of 2022, making up lost ground.[16] Once Vale recovers from its capacity constraints, it could add an additional 100 million tons of ore into the market, putting pressure on prices.\n\nFor both Australia and Brazil, no market matches the size and significance of China. The single province of Hebei in China, for example, imports more iron ore than the combined volume of Japan and South Korea, Australias second- and third-largest importers. Altogether, Australia supplies two-thirds of imported raw materials for Chinese steel mills. This produces a highly interdependent relationship between customer and supplier.\n\nThe rupture of this relationship could spell disaster for both countries. One of Australias most prominent mining executives put it colourfully in 2019, evoking the ability of each side to inflict pain on the other: \"China and Australia are in a kind of multi-scrotum clutch on iron ore,\" he said. \"They are not going to hurt us. We are not going to hurt them.\"[17]\n\nIn the case of China, the steel industry generated 7.2 trillion yuan (approximately $1.5 trillion) of revenue in 2015, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. China produces more than one billion tons of steel, making up more than 50 per cent of global production. By comparison, the second-largest steelmaker in the world, India, makes only about 5.9 per cent of the global production. The industry supports four of Chinas most crucial sectors: housing, infrastructure, industrial machinery, and autos. Collectively, they account for more than 80 per cent of steel consumption in China.\n\n2. Beijing signals diversification\n\nChina would want to diversify its sources of iron ore away from Australia whatever the political situation. Political tensions, however, are now accelerating those efforts. Statements by the likes of Senator Matt Canavan of the National Party and Clive Palmer that Australia should tax or restrict iron ore exports only heighten Chinese concerns. Although such statements might seem marginal inside Australia, they have been taken seriously inside China.[18] The big question now is not whether China will diversify supplies, but how. On top of its overdependence on Australia, Beijing has long been unhappy with its inability to influence the global iron ore price, despite the fact it is overwhelmingly the worlds largest importer of the commodity.\n\nOver the past decade, the Chinese government has tried a host of strategies to reduce its status as a price taker in the global market. It has tried unsuccessfully to appoint a single negotiator in the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) to haggle with big miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto. The Japanese steel mills, when they were the dominant buyer of iron ore, used to negotiate as a single entity, a position that global miners thought put them at a disadvantage.\n\nChina has so far failed to replicate this approach, largely due to the highly fragmented nature of the local industry and the way in which competing steelmakers sign supply agreements with miners. The unsuccessful intervention from the CISA also resulted in the abandonment of long-term benchmark pricing in favour of a spot price mechanism. With a few large mining companies supplying the market, this has worked to the detriment of Chinese steelmakers.\n\nAs a price taker, the Chinese government and steel mills have always looked for ways to boost non-Australian supplies and increase Chinese equity in overseas mines as ways to mitigate high prices.\n\nBeijing has also attempted to set up its own iron ore trading platform in order to gain more influence over pricing. Australian miners have offered perfunctory support to this Chinese initiative, but these efforts have gained little traction. Further, Chinese investors have poured money into Australia and elsewhere to develop additional resources. The most notable example is CITICs Sino Iron project with Clive Palmer. The project has been widely regarded as a costly misadventure for the Chinese conglomerate.\n\nDespite these efforts and billions sunk into the desert of Western Australia, the seaborne iron ore trade is still dominated by the big three Australian miners BHP, Rio Tinto, and Fortescue Metals Group along with Brazils Vale. In fact, the proportion of the iron ore sourced from mines with Chinese equity has dropped from 50 per cent in the 1980s to less than 10 per cent currently. The goal of the Chinese government is to increase that proportion to 20 per cent by about 2025.\n\nAs a price taker, the Chinese government and steel mills have always looked for ways to boost non-Australian supplies and increase Chinese equity in overseas mines as ways to mitigate high prices. The rupture in the bilateral relationship has added urgency to this effort. In a report compiled by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, one of the countrys leading think tanks, Australias ranking plunged from the second-safest investment destination in 2019 to the fifteenth-riskiest place within two years.[19]\n\nThere are now two strands of discussion taking place in China. Senior executives from steel industries and downstream end users are complaining about high commodity prices and their impact on profitability as well as their contribution to inflation. The State Council, Chinas cabinet, took up this issue in May 2021 as the country was hit with the highest producer prices in more than a decade.[20]\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang chaired a State Council meeting in May 2021 to address the issue of soaring commodities prices and the inflationary impact on the broader economy. He said the government needed to pay \"serious attention to the negative impact of escalating commodities prices\" and limit their impact on consumers.\n\nAt the top of the list at this meeting was iron ore. The government announced an increase in export tariffs for a number of steel products, a cut in import duties to zero for scrap iron, and eliminated export tax rebates in other areas. The government aimed to reduce steel production and thus demand for iron ore. On the supply side, the government proposed to increase domestic supply of iron ore and constrain energy-intensive and inefficient steel mills.[21]\n\nChen Derong, the chairman of Baowu Steel Group, the worlds largest steelmaker, said at the annual CISA conference in January 2020 that the \"most painful\" issue for the industry was the iron ore price. He made those comments when the price was below $100 per ton. [22] The price later rose to as high as $234. Chens frustration over surging prices and Chinas inability to tame them was shared by other industry bodies. Li Xingchuan of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute says the profit distribution between upstream suppliers, steelmakers, and downstream end users had been completely distorted. \"Chinese steelmakers are simply working for international miners,\" he said.[23]\n\nWhile Chinese miners complain about pricing, political leaders have focused on supply chain security. President Xi himself has made speeches on this topic, largely in the context of tensions with the United States and the need to make sure Chinese business is not dependent on hostile countries for industrial inputs. In April 2020, President Xi delivered what the state media called \"an important policy speech\" at the Central Economic Work Conference, one of the most critical policy meetings in China. It was later published in Qiushi (\"Seeking Truth\"), a key journal operated by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nIn his speech, President Xi emphasised the security and resilience of Chinas production and supply chains in the wake of the pandemic.[24] Once, Australia would have been irrelevant in such debates. But as a key provider of strategic raw materials for Chinese industry and a close ally of the United States, Australia has taken on heightened importance.\n\n\"In order to ensure the resilience of our industrial economy and national security, we must put more effort into self-reliant, secure, and controllable industrial production and supply chains. There should be at least one alternative supplier for strategic products,\" Xi said.[25]\n\nThe presidents emphasis on self-reliance and security was amplified at the Central Economic Work Conference. Control over production and supply chains was nominated as the second-most important policy objective after technological self-reliance.[26]\n\nThe latest industry plan from 2021 has elevated [Chinas] resource security to one of the key policy objectives for the next five years.\n\nSeven months after President Xis speech, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a draft policy paper on the development of the Chinese steel and iron industry and diversifying supply sources for the steel industry. In the paper, \"resource security\" was elevated to one of the top six policy objectives, the first time it has been ranked so highly as a concern. The issue is now ranked alongside other long-standing industry priorities such as industrial consolidation, innovation, and reducing pollution.\n\nIn the previous policy document published five years earlier, the main issues identified by the Chinese government were the longstanding problems of excess capacity, lack of innovation, environmental protection, and \"the disorderly\" steel market. Resource security only warranted a one paragraph mention towards the end of the industry plan, with a focus on pricing mechanisms and overseas investment.\n\nHowever, the latest industry plan from 2021 has elevated resource security to one of the key policy objectives for the next five years. The language is stronger, and the discussion of the issue has moved from the end of the policy paper to the forefront, signalling a significant shift in Beijings official thinking.\n\nThe 2021 draft policy document contained considerable detail about diversifying supplies, including targets for domestic production of iron ore, the recycling of scrap metal, and sourcing more resources from Chinese-invested mines overseas. The document also emphasised the need to strengthen relations with \"friendly\" neighbours such as Russia, Myanmar, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia, and promote exploration and extraction in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Africa.\n\nThis paper was the strongest policy statement from the Chinese industry planner and regulator underlining its intention to cut its dependency on Australian iron ore. It also signalled support for the development of the much-anticipated Simandou project in Guinea, West Africa. The document \"encourages steelmaking, transport, energy, and financial services industries to form consortia to accelerate the development and construction of large-scale iron ore mines in West Africa and Western Australia\". (The Australian reference was likely to the largely finished CITIC Sino Iron project, which is the largest Chinese overseas investment so far in iron ore.)\n\nBeijings senior geological technical advisers said the key to resolving Chinas supply dilemma was through developing more overseas mines, especially in West Africa.\n\nChinas current minister for Industry and Information Technology, Xiao Yaqing, has been one of the countrys most influential industrial apparatchiks for more than a decade.[27] Previously, he served as the chairman of Chinalco (China Aluminium), where in 2008 he pulled off one of Chinas largest corporate deals at the time, a US$14 billion raid to buy nine per cent of the shares in Rio Tinto, the AngloAustralian miner. Rio Tinto is the largest producer of iron ore in Australia. One of the goals behind the acquisition was to thwart the potential merger of BHP and Rio Tinto.[28] China had previously expressed an interest in buying Rio Tinto or another Australian mining major but had been rebuffed.[29]\n\nThe ministrys elevated concerns over resource security are echoed by China Geological Survey, the key government agency responsible for finding and exploring natural resources. The head of International Resources at China Geological Survey, Xiang Peng, and Hu Peng of Wuhan Bureau wrote in the official newspaper of the Ministry of Natural Resources, China Mining News, in August 2020: \"Should something happen to Australian and Brazilian supplies, Chinas iron ore supplies will be inevitably threatened.\"[30]\n\nBeijings senior geological technical advisers said the key to resolving Chinas supply dilemma was through developing more overseas mines, especially in West Africa. \"From the perspective of resources quality, the percentage of Chinese equity control, and diplomatic relationships, West Africa enjoys many competitive advantages. The timely development of regional iron ore supply bases will be significant in improving Chinas iron ore supply security,\" they argued. [31]\n\n3. Plan B: Simandou\n\nThe reference to West Africa made by Beijings senior advisers pertains to the massive Simandou project in Guinea, a country often touted as the potential third global force in iron ore after Australia and Brazil. Industry experts predict Simandou could produce around 150 million tons a year, which could service 14 per cent of Chinas annual imports of 1.07 billion tons annually.\n\nThe 110-kilometre Simandou mountain range is regarded as the best iron ore deposit in the world. A senior Rio Tinto executive involved in the Simandou project describes it as a \"national crown jewel asset, whether it is in Guinea or Australia or Canada\". Apart from Simandou, the executive said there were few high-quality iron ore resources left.[32] In the future, iron ore projects are likely to be magnetite projects with low iron content and high processing costs.\n\nThere are challenges in the Simandou project. The first is the sovereign risk of developing such a large-scale project in a country with weak institutions.\n\nIn 1997, Rio Tinto was given the exclusive rights to explore and develop one part of Simandou. After changes in ownership of exploration rights, Rio Tintos share in the project has been whittled down to 44.05 per cent of Blocks 3 and 4 tenements. Chinalco, the Chinese aluminum giant and Rio Tintos largest shareholder, acquired a 39.95 per cent share in these tenements. The SMBWinning Consortium comprising a group of Chinese and Singaporean companies beat Fortescue Mining Group to secure exploration rights for Blocks 1 and 2.\n\nThere are challenges in the Simandou project. The first is the sovereign risk of developing such a large-scale project in a country with weak institutions. A resource executive involved in the project said, \"Because the country is right down at the bottom in terms of poverty, the expectations or demands that come with developing a resource of that magnitude are much higher than they would be elsewhere.\"[33]\n\nThe Guinean government, which is trying to extract as much as possible from the project, has insisted on keeping the infrastructure serving the mine entirely within the country. That includes building a 620-kilometre railway, even though a much shorter route was available. The Guinean leaders closed off that option, which would have passed through neighbouring Liberia to the coast, to maximise the financial benefit to their country. Rio Tinto was unwilling to take on such risk to develop the project on Guinean government terms.\n\nThe estimated costs of developing Simandou are about US$15 billion. Guineas GDP in 2020 was $US15.64 billion.\n\nChinese Baowu Steel Group, the worlds largest steelmaker, is reportedly organising a consortium including the Chinese sovereign wealth fund and construction and engineering companies to invest in the project.[34] Caixin, a leading Chinese media group, reported in June 2020 that Baowu, which produces more than 100 million tons of steel a year, is in discussions with other large steelmakers about financing the project.\n\nApart from Baowus consortium, the SMBWinning consortium has already developed a sizeable mining project in Guinea and transformed the African state into the worlds largest exporter of bauxite. Before SMB started their project in Guinea, the country barely exported 300,000 tons of bauxite a year to China. Within 12 months of starting production, Guinea was exporting 40 times that amount. By 2019, annual bauxite exports to China reached a record high of 46 million tons. This alone is evidence that \"China Inc\", once given a directive by the top leadership, can pull off complex projects in Africa. In other words, Simandou is likely to emerge as a substantial supplier of iron ore to global markets and a competitor to Australia.\n\nChinese policies on iron ore do, however, contain contradictions. On the one hand, China wants more offshore production to bring prices down and reduce the leverage of Australian miners. On the other hand, Guinea sees Simandou as a nation-building project, not as a means to supply cheap ore to China. Investors, both Chinese and foreign, will also want a return on their substantial investments. Needless to say, efforts to manage and manipulate commodities markets, by national governments, cartels, and private interests, have a long history of failure.",

London bluntly rejected Moscows claim.\n\nThe Turkey and UN-brokered deal to unlock grain exports signed between Russia and Ukraine in July is critical to easing the global food crisis caused by the conflict.\n\nThe agreement has already allowed more than 9 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain to be exported and was due to be renewed on November 19.\n\n\"The Russian side suspends participation in the implementation of agreements on the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports,\" the defence ministry said in a statement.\n\nRussia said the step, which will cut Ukrainian grain exports from its crucial Black Sea ports, was taken due to the drone attack and the participation of British specialists.\n\nSevastopol, which has been targeted several times in recent months, serves as the headquarters for the fleet and a logistical hub for operations in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian army claimed to have \"destroyed\" nine aerial drones and seven maritime ones in an attack on the port early on Saturday.\n\nMoscows forces alleged British \"specialists\", who they said were based in the southern Ukrainian city of Ochakiv, had helped prepare and train Kyiv to carry out the attack.\n\nIn a further singling out of the UK which Moscow sees as one of the most hostile Western countries Russia said the same British unit was involved in explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines last month.\n\nThe UK strongly rebutted both claims, saying \"the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale\".\n\nRussias foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow would raise the blasts and the alleged drone attack at the United Nations Security Council.\n\nThe British Ministry of Defence said this \"invented story says more about arguments going on inside the Russian Government than it does about the West\".\n\nMoscows military said ships targeted at their Crimean base were involved in the UN-brokered grain deal.\n\nRussia had recently criticised the deal, saying its grain exports have suffered due to Western sanctions.\n\nRussias decision \"proves once again that negotiations with the Russian Federation are a waste of time\", a top Ukrainian official said.\n\n\"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin has turned food, the cold and prices into weapons against the world Russia is waging a hybrid war against Europe, taking Africa and the Middle East hostage,\" presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe UN also called for the preservation of the agreement.\n\n\"It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative which is a critical humanitarian effort,\" said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN secretary-general, underscoring the initiative was \"having a positive impact\" on food access for millions worldwide.\n\nHe said the UN chiefs office was in touch with Russian authorities over the issue.",

Moscow won guarantees for its own grain and fertilizer exports.\n\nUkraine has called for the renewal of the deal, but concerns over whether Russia will agree to an extension beyond the Nov. 19 deadline have grown recently. Gennady Gatilov, Russias ambassador to the UN in Geneva, last week told Reuters that Moscow had delivered a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres setting out a list of complaints about the initiative.\n\nSince Aug. 1, the grain deal struck in Istanbul has resulted in 380 vessels carrying 8.5 million tonnes of agricultural products from Ukraines Black Sea ports to countries in Africa, Asia and Europe, according to the ministry. The deal has eased a world food crisis, but as more shippers have joined, the handful of inspection teams has fallen behind.\n\nConcerns have been raised by trade specialists about the wait time for vessels due to reduced numbers of inspections, which have been significantly less than the 12 supposed to be conducted each day.\n\nUkraine, a major global supplier of wheat, corn and sunflower oil, still lags far behind in grain exports year-on-year, having shipped 10.8 million tonnes in 2022-23, compared to 16.5 million tonnes through Oct. 17 of 2021-22, according to Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "MOSCOW -\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday denied having any intentions of using nuclear weapons in Ukraine but described the conflict there as part of alleged efforts by the West to secure its global domination, which he insisted are doomed to fail.\n\nSpeaking at a conference of international foreign policy experts, Putin said it's pointless for Russia to strike Ukraine with nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We see no need for that,\" Putin said. \"There is no point in that, neither political, nor military.\"\n\nPutin said an earlier warning of his readiness to use \"all means available to protect Russia\" didn't amount to nuclear sabre-rattling but was merely a response to Western statements about their possible use of nuclear weapons.\n\nHe particularly mentioned Liz Truss saying in August that she would be ready to use nuclear weapons if she became Britain's prime minister, a remark which he said worried the Kremlin.\n\n\"What were we supposed to think?\" Putin said. \"We saw that as a coordinated position, an attempt to blackmail us.\"\n\nIn a long speech full of diatribes against the United States and its allies, Putin accused them of trying to dictate their terms to other nations in a \"dangerous, bloody and dirty\" domination game.\n\nPutin, who sent his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, has cast Western support for Ukraine as part of broad efforts by Washington and its allies to enforce its will upon others through a rules-based world order. He argued that the world has reached a turning point, when \"the West is no longer able to dictate its will to humankind but still tries to do it, and the majority of nations no longer want to tolerate it.\"\n\nThe Russian leader claimed that the Western policies will foment more chaos, adding that \"he who sows the wind will reap the whirlwind.\"\n\nPutin claimed that \"humankind now faces a choice: accumulate a load of problems that will inevitably crush us all or try to find solutions that may not be ideal but could work and could make the world more stable and secure.\"\n\nWithout offering evidence, the Russian leader repeated Moscow's unproven allegation that Ukraine was plotting a false flag attack involving a radioactive dirty bomb it would try to pin on Russia.\n\nUkraine has strongly rejected the claim, and its Western allies have dismissed it as \"transparently false.\" Ukraine argued Russia might be making the unfounded allegation to serve as a cover for its own possible plot to detonate a dirty bomb.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters on Thursday that the U.S. has still not seen anything to indicate that Putin has decided to use a dirty bomb.\n\nPutin said he personally ordered Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to call his foreign counterparts to tell them about the purported plot. He maintained that Russia knows the Ukrainian facilities working on the project.\n\nHe mocked the allegations by Ukraine and the West that Russia was firing on the territory of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine as \"ravings.\" Russian troops have occupied the plant, Europe's largest, since the early days of the conflict.\n\nPutin also expressed bewilderment about Washington's policy on China, noting that tensions sparked by a recent visit to Taiwan by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi come amid the U.S.-Russian showdown over Ukraine.\n\n\"Why spoil relations with China at the same time?\" Putin said. \"It seems to defy logic and common sense. It looks like ravings.\"\n\nHe hailed Russia's relations with China, but said he hadn't warned Chinese President Xi Jinping about his intention to send troops into Ukraine when he visited Beijing days before that to attend the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nAsked about Washington's threat to re-evaluate its relationship with Saudi Arabia over the Riyadh-led OPEC+ alliance's move to cut oil production, Putin argued that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was acting in his nation's interests and the need to stabilize global energy markets.\n\n\"They need to respect the crown prince and Saudi Arabia, and they will respond in kind,\" Putin said. \"And they will also respond in kind if they are spoken to in a boorish manner.\"\n\nThe Russian leader said Russia isn't the enemy of the West but will continue to oppose the purported diktat of Western neo-liberal elites, accusing them of trying to subdue Russia.\n\n\"Their goal is to make Russia more vulnerable and turn it into an instrument for fulfilling their geopolitical tasks, they have failed to achieve it and they will never succeed,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin reaffirmed his long-held claim that Russians and Ukrainians are part of a single people and again denigrated Ukraine as an \"artificial state\" that received historic Russian lands from Communist rulers during the Soviet times.\n\nIn that context, he acknowledged that the fighting in Ukraine effectively amounts to a civil war, although the Kremlin calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special military operation.\"\n\nPutin said he thinks \"all the time\" about the casualties that Russia has suffered in Ukraine, but insisted that NATO's refusal to rule out Ukraine's prospective membership and Kyiv's refusal to adhere to a peace deal for its separatist conflict in the country's east has left Moscow no other choice.\n\nHe denied underestimating Ukraine's ability to fight back and insisted that his \"special military operation\" has proceeded as planned.\n\nPutin also acknowledged the challenges posed by Western sanctions, but argued that Russia has proven resilient to foreign pressure and has become more united.\n\nJohn Kirby, a U.S. National Security Council spokesman, responded to Putin's speech as it was underway.\n\n\"We don't believe that Mr. Putin's strategic goals have changed here. He doesn't want Ukraine to exist as a sovereign, independent nation state,\" Kirby said.",

He resigned in May because he felt the war had shown how repressive and warped Russia and its leaders had become.\n\n8:50 p.m.: The U.S. State Department said Secretary Antony Blinken spoke on Saturday with his counterpart in India about Russia's war on Ukraine among other issues, Reuters reported.\n\nBlinken spoke with Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar about \"regional and global issues, including counterterrorism cooperation and Russias continuing aggression against Ukraine,\" the department said in a release.\n\nIndia has been a large purchaser of Russia's oil, which is helping to fund its war against Ukraine.\n\nJaishankar will visit Russia on Nov. 8, the Russian embassy in India said on Thursday.\n\n8:04 p.m.:\n\n7:13 p.m.: The firing of Denis Skopin, an associate professor at St. Petersburg State University (SPSU), for his opposition to the Kremlins invasion of Ukraine is the latest instance of a deepening crackdown on academic freedom inside Russia, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.\n\nSkopin -- who taught philosophy in the universitys Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences -- was fired on October 26 for his participation in a protest against Moscows mobilization of military-age men to fight in Ukraine, where he was arrested and sentenced to 10 days in jail. While detained, Skopin and other protesters were also allegedly pressured by authorities to submit summonses to their local military enlistment office.\n\nAccording to the dismissal order issued by the university, Skopin was fired for his opposition to Moscows February 24 invasion of Ukraine and for protesting against the mobilization drive that began on September 21: \"The act committed by the employee is immoral and incompatible with the implementation of educational functions and the continuation of this work,\" the order stated.\n\n\"A university is a place where people should think, where qualities such as critical thinking and independent thought should be encouraged,\" Skopin told RFE/RLs North.Realities during an interview. \"Unfortunately, this is no longer possible in today's Russia.\"\n\n6 p.m.: US President Joe Biden said Russia's suspension of its participation in an agreement that allowed vital grain exports from Ukraine was \"purely outrageous,\" while speaking to reporters Saturday, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\nThere is \"no reason for them to do that,\" the president said of the halt to the deal, which had been heralded as critical to easing the global food crisis caused by the conflict.\n\n5:13 p.m.:\n\n4:15 p.m.: Russia and Ukraine carried out the latest in series of prisoner of war exchanges on Saturday, with both sides returning around 50 people, officials in Moscow and Kyiv said.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence directorate reported the return of 52 detainees, among them soldiers, sailors, border guards, national guard members and doctors, Reuters reports.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyy said that since March, Russia had freed a total of 1,031 prisoners.\n\n\"We remember all those who are held captive in Russia and on occupied territory and will do everything to ensure that each and every one is returned,\" he said in a video address.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said Ukraine handed over 50 prisoners of war after talks.\n\n4:10 p.m.: The European Union said Saturday, it supports U.N. led efforts to keep the Ukraine grain deal alive after Moscow announced it is exiting the initiative, Reuters reports.\n\n\"We ... stress that all parties must refrain from any unilateral action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people around the world,\" said Nabila Massrali, spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy at the European Commission.\n\n3 p.m.: Ukraine is gaining the upper hand against Russia in southern Kherson with range and precision guidance of artillery, and drones, The New York Times reports. In a war that is fought primarily through the air, Ukraine is turning the tables against Russia with Western weapons and homemade drones.\n\n\"We can reach them, and they cannot reach us,\" said Major Oleksandr, the commander of an artillery battery on the Kherson front, who like others interviewed for this article gave only his first name for security reasons. \"They dont have these weapons\" he said.\n\nOleksandr also said that falling rates of Russia firing also point to ammunition shortages. \"There is an idea the Russian army is infinite, but it is a myth,\" he said. \"The intensity of fire has fallen by three times. Its realistic to fight them,\" he added.\n\n2:45 p.m.: There is anxiety in policy circles that if the upcoming U.S. midterm elections lead to a Republican-controlled Congress, U.S. President Joe Biden leading Western countries in providing military aid to Ukraine could suffer setbacks. In an interview with Politico, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said U.S. Republicans election promises to slash Ukraines support will only empower China.\n\nThe NATO chief made the case for a long-term American presence in Europe and a widespread boost in defense spending.\n\n\"The presence of the United States but also Canada in Europe, is essential for the strength and the credibility of that transatlantic bond,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n1:30 p.m.: A top Ukrainian official said Saturday Russias decision to exit the U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal \"proves once again that negotiations with the Russian Federation are a waste of time,\" Reuters reports.\n\n\"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin has turned food, the cold and prices into weapons against the world ... Russia is waging a hybrid war against Europe, taking Africa and the Middle East hostage,\" presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted.\n\n1:20 p.m.: In an interview with RFE/RL Boris Bondarev, a counselor at Russia's permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva and a 20-year veteran of the countrys foreign service said Moscows invasion of Ukraine has dealt a deep blow to Russian foreign policy and has left the countrys diplomats with an \"impossible\" task of trying to pursue the Kremlins goals amid increasing isolation.\n\nBondarev who resigned from his post in May said \"I observed the evolving decline in our diplomacy [and] its slide into an abyss of provocations and lies. But still, until there was war and until blood was shed, I - like many of my colleagues - believed that I could still work.\"\n\n12:30 p.m.: Ukraine's foreign minister accused Moscow of using a \"false pretext\" to suspend its participation Saturday from the U.N. brokered grain export deal that allowed Ukraine to resume exporting grain from Black Sea ports. Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter \"We have warned of Russias plans to ruin the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\" He also called on countries to demand that Russia stop its \"hunger games.\"\n\nU.N. Spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the U.N. is in touch with the Russian authorities on this matter. \"It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people around the world.\" he said, as reported by VOA U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer.\n\n11:30 a.m.: The Russian Defense Ministry says Moscow has suspended its implementation of a U.N.-brokered grain export deal which has allowed more than 9 million tons of grain to be exported from Ukraine and brought down global food prices. The ministry cited an alleged Ukrainian drone attack against Russias Black Sea Fleet ships moored off the coast of occupied Crimea, which Russia says took place in early Saturday, as the reason for the move, The Associated Press reports. Ukraine has denied staging the attack.\n\nThe Russian declaration came one day after U.N. chief Antonio Guterres urged Russia and Ukraine to renew the grain deal. Guterres also urged other countries, mainly in the West, to expedite the removal of obstacles blocking Russian grain and fertilizer exports.\n\n\"It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people around the world,\" U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.\n\n11:10 a.m.: A senior Ukrainian official expressed skepticism on Saturday about the takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk, whose relations with Kyiv have been precarious since the billionaire suggested in early October Ukraine should give up occupied land for peace, The Associated Press reports.\n\nMusk, a self-declared \"free speech absolutist,\" wants to shake up Twitter's content moderation, and tweeted that \"the bird is freed\" after completing the purchase.\n\nUkrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted on Saturday: \"Did the bird really get its freedom, or has it just moved to a new cage?\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev wished new Twitter owner Elon Musk luck on Friday for his takeover of the company, adding a request for the multi-billionaire to stop his support for Ukraine.\n\nMusk's Starlink satellite system provides Internet access to users in areas where local mobile communication systems or Internet cables are damaged or destroyed, for example, as a result of missile attacks. It it also being used by the Ukrainian military.\n\n10:55 a.m.: More than 5,500 electrical maintenance workers are struggling to make repairs in Ukraine, as Russia continues to attack the country's power grid and other infrastructure, The New York Times reports.\n\n\"We are not afraid of the dark. The darkest times for us are not without light, but without freedom,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday.\n\nZelenskyy said about four million Ukrainians are living with power restrictions.\n\nRussia began targeting Ukraine's electric system on Oct. 10, The Times said, as part of a \"campaign that Russian officials have said is meant to cause civilian suffering and force Ukraine to submit to the Kremlin's will.\"\n\n9 a.m.: The Dutch military intelligence service has warned companies that Moscow is trying to obtain high-tech assets for its war in Ukraine through front companies, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\nJan Swillens, head of the military intelligence service of the Netherlands said that Russian secret services have set up dozens of \"front companies\" in the Netherlands to evade Western sanctions. The companies buy technology in the Netherlands and then import it into Russia for military purposes.\n\n8:55 a.m.: Ukrainian forces stationed near the northern border with Belarus say they are bracing for a possible Russian assault from across the frontier.\n\nBorder guards stationed in the Chernihiv region are monitoring the situation on the border, facing intermittent Russian shelling. The region is located north of Kyiv and is bordered by both Russia and Belarus, the Associated Press reports.\n\nSpokesperson Halyna Shechovtsova told British broadcaster Sky that her unit was preparing fortifications due to the perceived increased risk.\n\nA member of the guard, equipped with a British-made portable anti-tank missile system, told Sky his unit needed more weapons as they would be the \"first line\" of defense.\n\nHorodnia, the nearest town to this double border, was captured by Russian forces at the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February.\n\nIt returned to Ukrainian control after Moscow repositioned its forces towards the east and south a few months later.\n\nSpeaking to Sky, resident Nadia Polovetska said the ongoing war gave \"no rest\" to the town's residents.\n\n\"Our nerves are completely shot,\" she said.\n\nRussia used Belarus as a staging ground for troops and weapons when it invaded Ukraine eight months ago.\n\nFears persist that the authoritarian president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, who has publicly supported Russia's attack on Ukraine, might agree to send his own troops south into Ukraine.\n\nSo far, Lukashenko has repeatedly rebuffed speculation that Belarus would send its own soldiers to fight alongside Russia.\n\nEarlier this month, however, authorities announced a joint \"regional grouping of troops\" with Russia and said some 9,000 Russian soldiers would be stationed in Belarus.\n\n8:30 a.m.: Russia's defense ministry on Saturday said that British navy personnel blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines last month, directly accusing a leading NATO member of sabotaging critical Russian infrastructure, Reuters reported.\n\nThe defense ministry did not provide evidence to back up its claim.\n\n\"According to available information, representatives of this unit of the British Navy took part in the planning, provision and implementation of a terrorist attack in the Baltic Sea on September 26 this year - blowing up the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines,\" the ministry said.\n\nBritain's defense ministry declined immediate comment.\n\nRussia has previously blamed the West for the explosions last month that ruptured the Russian-built Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines on the bed of the Baltic Sea.\n\nBut Russia has never before given specific details of who was responsible for the damage to the pipelines, previously the largest routes for Russian gas supplies to Europe.\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly said allegations of Russian responsibility for the damage were \"stupid\" and Russian officials have said Washington had a motive as it wants to sell more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe.\n\nThe United States has denied involvement.\n\n8:25 a.m.: Could Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine lose the will to fight? At least one expert interviewed by CNN thinks so.\n\n\"Fear and panic are more infectious than COVID\" for an army, said Jeff McCausland, a combat veteran of the Gulf War and a visiting professor of international security studies at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania.\n\nHe said a key factor that leads to soldiers giving up on the battlefield is whether they believe in the cause they're fighting for.\n\nHe pointed out that Ukrainians are fighting to defend their families and country, but for the Russians opposing them, the purpose may not be so clear.\n\n6 a.m.:\n\n5:00 a.m.: Russia said on Saturday that the accelerated deployment of modernized U.S. tactical nuclear weapons at NATO bases in Europe would lower the \"nuclear threshold\" and that Russia would take the move into account in its military planning, Reuters reports.\n\nPolitico reported that the United States told a closed NATO meeting that it would accelerate the deployment of a modernized version of the B61, the B61-12, with the new weapons arriving at European bases in December, several months earlier than planned.\n\nRussia has around 2,000 working tactical nuclear weapons while the United States has around 200 such weapons, half of which are at bases in Italy, Germany, Turkey, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\n4:10 a.m.: More than a million Ukrainians have fled to Germany since Russia's invasion in February. Among the European Union countries, only Poland has welcomed more, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nA key challenge is the \"major uncertainty\" faced by the Ukrainians, said Benjamin Beckmann, who oversees integration programs at Germany's federal office for migration and refugees.\n\nFor many of them -- mostly women and children -- it remains an open question whether or not they will return to their homeland once the war is over.\n\n3:19 a.m.: A Russian-installed governor in Moscow-annexed Crimea said the Russian navy was \"repelling\" a drone attack early Saturday in the bay of Sevastopol, home to Moscow's Black Sea Fleet, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\n\"Ships of the Black Sea Fleet are repelling a UVA (unmanned aerial vehicle) in Sevastopol bay,\" Sevastopol governor Mikhail Razvozhayev said on Telegram. \"No facilities in the city have been hit. The situation is under control.\"\n\nCity authorities later said that the harbor was \"temporarily\" closed to boats and ferries.\n\n2:10 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says about 4 million people across Ukraine have been hit by power restrictions that Ukraines energy companies have been forced to impose because of damage to infrastructure caused by Russia's bombing campaign, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n\nZelenskyy said in his nightly address on October 28 that the areas affected include the Kyiv and Kharkiv and the regions around the two major cities.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said the city's energy supply system on October 28 was operating in emergency mode. He said it would take two to three weeks to eliminate an electricity deficit ranging between 20 percent and 50 percent.\n\n12:41 a.m.:\n\n12 a.m.: A U.S. fighter in Ukraine detailed the horrors of war to a CBS News reporter. In an interview the American volunteer said \"We are fighting pure evil. Anybody in the West that asks Ukraine to just do peace talks, they need to go to these villages. They need to see whats been done to these people.\" He said he witnessed Russians using white phosphorus munitions. \"It comes down extremely slow. But there is nothing you can do and everything it touches, just incinerates.\"\n\nSome material for this article came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "Winston Churchill once alluded to Kremlin power struggles as 'bulldogs fighting under a carpet' \"an outsider only hears the growling, and when he sees the bones fly out from beneath, it is obvious who won\".\n\nChurchill was, of course, alluding to Kremlinology relating to the Soviet politburo, but the allusion has often been used to reference infighting in Putins Kremlin. On 14 October, however, a summit in the Kazakh capital of Astana showed how it can still apply to relations among the former Soviet states, at least those that, like Russia, are still governed by undemocratic and oft-despotic strongmen.\n\nBut the bone that flew out of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) summit in Astana has shocked many for it was Vladimir Putins. And the bulldog who spat it out was Tajikistans President Emomali Rahmon.\n\nVideo from the summit of Rahmon berating Putin and demanding that Russia treat Central Asian states with respect has gone viral, racking up 6mn views as of the time of writing. In his seven-and-a-half-minute diatribe, Rahmon calls on Putin to invest more in Central Asia, effectively accusing him of lying about the number of Tajik migrants in Russia, and warns that paying insufficient attention to small nations risks repeating the mistakes of the Soviet collapse. Rahmons warning that Tajik migration is likely to decrease to Russia may even have been a threat after all, Moscow may well need migrant labour to plug the holes in its economy caused by the drafting of men to fight for Putin's cause in Ukraine, which even Putin has admitted has been poorly managed.\n\nLandlocked Tajikistan, the poorest former Soviet republic, is home to Russias largest military base abroad (excluding those in occupied Ukraine). Despite Rahmons assertion, it is also the most dependent on migrant labour. It is as if a handbag-sized French bulldog spit out the bone of a champion boxer as the stunned guises of the other Central Asian leaders, not to mention Putin himself, attest.\n\nRahmons outburst was particularly striking, as the tea leaves in the weeks prior to it gave no indication such a statement would be forthcoming. When Tajik forces shelled Kyrgyzstans Batken district in the latest, and most intense, bout of their long-running border dispute, Russian state media was broadly more positive regarding Dushanbes actions than Bishkeks. And although Putin reportedly shifted at least 1,500 of the 7,000 Russian soldiers from their Tajik base to the front in Ukraine, Putin awarded Rahmon the 'Order of Merit for the Fatherland' in the third degree after the fighting, including for his services to \"ensuring regional stability and security,\" shortly after the fighting ended.\n\nSpeculation has been rife as to what prompted Rahmons outburst. Tajikistans media environment is strictly controlled, with officials all but barred from speaking to foreign reporters and interlocutors, even off the record. There is no democratic accountability. And lest there be any doubt, Rahmons statement by no means should be seen as casting him as a new leader against the bogeyman of Russian colonialism or of small third-world states rights he is currently waging his toughest crackdown on the countrys Pamiri minority to date.\n\nThere has been speculation that Rahmon may have been motivated by attempts by Putin to mediate in the conflict with Kyrgyzstan in a meeting the previous day with Rahmon and Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov. Putin said that he had presented them with documents about the border in an attempt to address the dispute, noting that \"in Moscow there is often more relevant information on the borders of the union republics (ex-Soviet states) than in these republics themselves\". Rahmon criticised Moscows approach to the region openly, Rahmons erstwhile bte-noire, the late former Uzbek dictator Islam Karimov, reaped little benefit from his approach.\n\nBut there is no reason to believe that Rahmons criticism was an open declaration that he will distance himself from Moscow. Rahmons policies are set only by what is best for himself and his family, who dominate the countrys politics and industry. An open conflict with Moscow would threaten both, as even in the Kremlins present geopolitical position, significantly enervated by Putin's wanton war on Ukraine, Tajikistan has no other alternatives. While Europe has laid plans to increase its investments in the country despite its human rights record, it remains too distant and disjointed to respond. Washington is also not a potential panacea. And while China dominates foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country, and holdings of Tajik debt, there is no chance it will change its approach to Russia on the basis of Rahmons actions.\n\nWhat Rahmon aims to achieve remains uncertain. But whether it is Putins approach to the Kyrgyz border, or just an attempt to demand more investments (and thus the size of the pie that Rahmons family and associates can feast on), it is the latest indication that something has fundamentally changed in Russias geo-strategic position even in the former Soviet near abroad following the folly of his 24 February full-blown invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA day after Rahmons outburst, at least 11 Russian soldiers were killed at a training base in the Valuyki district of Belgorod Oblast, near the border with Ukraine. A Telegram channel considered close to the Kremlin and which typically blames Ukrainians for almost every misfortune to befall Russia almost immediately blamed two Tajik volunteers. There is no precedent for such an attack by Tajiks against the Russian military.\n\nThe fight under the carpet continues, but the growling is increasingly deafening.\n\nMaximilian Hess is a London-based political risk consultant and a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

Credit... Emile Ducke for The New York Times\n\nRIGA, Latvia Russia is massing thousands of troops in its western neighbor Belarus ahead of what could be the opening of a new front aimed at disrupting the flow of Western military aid from Poland, according to defense officials in Latvia and Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the assembled forces, about 10,000 troops, may still be too weak to make a successful new thrust south from Belarus, Latvias defense minister, Artis Pabriks, said on Friday.\n\n\"We have to be cautious, but I doubt that Russians are at this moment capable of opening another front line against Ukraine, at least not a successful front,\" Mr. Pabriks said in an interview in Riga, the capital of Latvia, which borders both Russia and Belarus.\n\nAn announcement last week by Belarus that it was forming a new joint military force with Russia stirred alarm in the West that the Kremlin might be preparing a new ground assault with help from Belarusian forces. Russia massed troops in Belarus ahead of its initial attack on Ukraine in February.\n\nOn Thursday, a Ukrainian general, Oleksiy Gromov, said that the threat of a possible invasion from Belarus was growing. He said that a new attack would likely not drive toward Kyiv which lies just 60 miles from the border with Belarus but rather to the west of the capital, nearer to the Polish border. An offensive south from western Belarus into Ukrainian territory near the border with Poland could disrupt the flow of weapons to Ukraine from the United States and its allies, much of which passes through Poland.\n\nThe military officials in Riga and Kyiv did not say precisely where the Russian troops were gathering, nor why they believed a new offensive could occur closer to Poland than to Kyiv.\n\nRussia used the territory of Belarus, its closest military and political ally, as a staging ground for its February invasion and has since launched missiles and drones into Ukraine from there. But President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Belaruss veteran strongman leader, has resisted Russias pressure to get directly involved in the war.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Lukashenko said it would be undesirable for Belarusian military equipment to be used in Ukraine and denied his countrys troops were training for war, adding \"no war today. We dont need it,\" the state news agency Belta reported.\n\nMr. Lukashenko made a similar statement in February, just days before Russia invaded Ukraine from his territory.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraines armed forces said in a statement that if the country were attacked again from Belarus, it would \"respond as fiercely as we respond to all occupiers.\" A new front in the north would inevitably pull Ukrainian forces away from the south and east, where they have launched offensives to take back land Russia captured early in the war.\n\nThe flurry of military activity in Belarus in recent days, Britains defense ministry said on Friday, is \"likely an attempt to demonstrate Russian-Belarusian solidarity and to convince Ukraine to divert forces to guard the northern border.\"\n\nNoting claims by Mr. Lukashenko that 70,000 Belarusians and 15,000 Russians would be involved in their new joint force, Britains defense ministry said it was unlikely that Russia had actually deployed significant forces and added that Belarus \"maintains minimal capability to undertake complex operations.\"\n\nVadym Skibitsky, a spokesman for Ukraines military intelligence agency, said in an interview that Ukraine also did not see an immediate threat of another attack from Belarus.\n\nSeveral thousand newly mobilized Russian soldiers are deployed in Belarus at training sites, Mr. Skibitsky said, but they are not accompanied by tanks, artillery or fuel trucks and other logistical support they would need to invade and face Ukraines battle-hardened troops.\n\n\"We see these elements now moving into Belarus, but we do not see the movement of equipment,\" he said.\n\nBrig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, also played down the likelihood of a new Russian invasion from Belarus. \"We dont currently have any indications of a potential imminent military action on that front,\" he told a briefing on Thursday.\n\nAndrew E.

Nicole Tung for The New York Times\n\nKYIV, Ukraine The civilian administration installed by President President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the strategically important southern port city of Kherson began to crumble on Monday, with proxy officials abandoning the government headquarters as Ukrainian forces continued to make progress advancing on the city.\n\nUkrainian officials, videos on social media and accounts from Ukrainian activists who have spoken to residents offered a glimpse of the chaotic situation on the ground in Kherson: Merchants are refusing to be paid in Russian currency, government offices have been emptied of essential equipment and civilians have been told by proxy officials loyal to the Kremlin to take \"documents, money, valuables and clothes\" and flee the city.\n\nAccounts from Ukrainian officials and activists suggested the occupation administration was in disarray and the humanitarian situation was growing dire.\n\nThe reports were difficult to verify independently because internet and other communication services in Kherson have been almost completely severed, in what Ukrainian activists said was a deliberate effort by Russian officials to thwart Kyivs military.\n\nBut even as the situation in Kherson appeared to be increasingly unstable, Ukrainian officials said Moscows troops were preparing to stay and fight for a city that Mr. Putin illegally claimed as Russian territory less than three weeks ago.\n\nThere was no evidence that Russian soldiers were preparing for a mass withdrawal, Gen.

Budanov, the head of Ukraines military intelligence service, said in an interview published Monday by a Ukrainian news outlet, Ukrainska Pravda.\n\nHe added that the Kremlin proxy officials moves to evacuate civilians and pull their own workers out of the city could be an effort to ready Kherson for urban combat by Russian troops.\n\n\"They are not preparing to exit now,\" General Budanov said of Russian soldiers. \"They are preparing to defend.\"\n\nSerhii Khlan, the exiled deputy governor of the Kherson region, said Moscows forces and local proxies are engaged in \"intense pillaging,\" stealing \"everything with archaeological and historical significance.\" While his claims could not be independently verified, looting by Russian forces in other parts of the country has been widely documented.\n\nGeneral Budanov said the largest Russian bank operating in the city, Promsvyazbank, was withdrawing and clearing out the cash from its vaults. He also claimed that occupation officials were emptying hospitals of patients as part \"a crazy information campaign\" designed to show audiences in Russia that Moscow cares about civilians.\n\n\"In other words, they are creating the illusion that everything has gone,\" he said. \"At the same time, on the contrary, they are bringing in new military units there and preparing the streets of the city for defense.\"\n\nLocated on the west bank of the Dnipro River, Kherson is the gateway to both Russian-held Crimea in the south and Ukraines Black Sea ports to the west, including Odesa. Its loss would be a severe military and symbolic blow for Mr. Putin, who has rejected requests from his commanders on the ground that they be allowed to retreat from the city.\n\nWhile the billboards declaring \"Kherson is forever with Russia\" are still standing, local leaders loyal to the Kremlin said this weekend that \"all departments and ministries of civil administration\" must be moved across the Dnipro River to territory seen as safer from advancing Ukrainian forces. Occupation officials also said they would relocate as many as 60,000 civilians.\n\nMoscow claims that as many as 20,000 people have fled, but Ukrainian officials put the figure at closer to 1,000 and say that most are pro-Kremlin collaborators.\n\nImage People who fled their homes in southern Ukraine were staying at a center for displaced people in Zaporizhzia on Sunday. Credit... Ivor Prickett for The New York Times\n\nKyiv has imposed a blackout on detailed information about its southern offensive, aiming to maintain an element of surprise as its forces fight to reclaim towns and villages around Kherson, which Russia seized in the first weeks of the war and is the only provincial capital in Ukraine to fall since Moscows invasion. The Ukrainian militarys southern command said on Monday that since it launched its counteroffensive at the end of August, its forces have retaken 90 towns and villages where more than 12,000 people were still living.\n\nRussias hold on Kherson appears increasingly precarious. Last week, the top Russian commander in Ukraine, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, said the situation in Kherson was \"already difficult\" and that he was \"not ruling out difficult decisions,\" although he did not elaborate.",

The ministry has begun preparing for such a scenario, it said, readying forces and resources \"to perform tasks in conditions of radioactive contamination.\"\n\nThe UN nuclear watchdog said on Monday it was preparing to send inspectors in the coming days to two Ukrainian sites at Kyivs request, in an apparent reaction to the Russian \"dirty bomb\" claims. It said both sites were already subject to its inspections and one was inspected a month ago.\n\nRussias state news agency RIA had earlier identified what it said were the two sites involved in the operation the Eastern Mineral Enrichment Plant in central Dnipropetrovsk region and the Institute for Nuclear Research in Kyiv.

Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times\n\nRussia on Saturday said that it was suspending its participation in an agreement to export grain and other agricultural products from Ukrainian ports, upending a deal that was intended to alleviate a global food crisis.\n\nThe announcement from Russias Defense Ministry came hours after it accused Ukraine of launching an attack on ships from the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea that it said were participating in the grain initiative, which was organized around specific shipping lanes in the Black Sea.\n\nRussia at first said that it had repulsed the attack by Ukrainian drones, but later backtracked and said at least one minesweeper had sustained damage.\n\nGiven the attack, the statement from the Defense Ministry said, \"Russia suspends its participation in the implementation of the agreements on the export of agricultural products from Ukraine.\"\n\nThe suspension will be \"for an indefinite period,\" according to Russias Foreign Ministry. It said in a statement that Russia stood ready to sell its own grain to world markets as a replacement for Ukrainian grain.\n\nThe agreement, known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative, was signed in July and ended a five-month Russian blockade of Ukraines ports. Brokered with Russia and Ukraine by the United Nations and Turkey, the deal was set to expire on Nov. 19. In recent weeks, its future had appeared uncertain.\n\nThe United Nations said Saturday that it was in touch with the Russian authorities regarding the reports that Russia was suspending participation.\n\n\"It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people,\" Stphane Dujarric, the spokesman for Antnio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said.\n\nUkraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government had warned that Russia would try to upend the deal.\n\n\"Now Moscow uses a false pretext to block the grain corridor which ensures food security for millions of people,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"I call on all states to demand Russia to stop its hunger games and recommit to its obligations.\"\n\nAlthough the grain deals primary goal was to end Russias blockade on Ukrainian exports, which had been contributing to a global food crisis, it also allowed for more shipments of Russian grain and fertilizer. As part of the deal, the United States and the European Union gave assurances that banks and companies involved in trading Russian grain and fertilizer would be exempt from sanctions.\n\nIn recent weeks Russia had suggested it might refuse to extend the agreement if Moscows demands over its food and fertilizer exports were not met.\n\nUnder the pact, Ukrainian pilots guide ships through Ukrainian minefields around the ports, and are then given safe passage by the Russian Navy to Turkey, where teams with representatives from all the parties inspect them before they head to delivery ports. Returning ships are also inspected for arms.\n\nCassandra Vinograd contributed reporting.",

                "cc_text": "Key findings of the 2022 Report on Trkiye\n\nThere are serious deficiencies in the functioning of Trkiyes democratic institutions. During the reporting period, democratic backsliding continued. Structural deficiencies in the presidential system remained in place. Key recommendations from the Council of Europe and its bodies have yet to be addressed. Parliament continued to lack the necessary means to hold the government accountable. The constitutional architecture continued to centralise powers at the level of the Presidency without ensuring the sound and effective separation of powers between the executive, legislative and the judiciary. In the absence of an effective checks and balances mechanism, the democratic accountability of the executive branch continues to be limited to elections.\n\nDespite the lifting of the state of emergency in July 2018, some legal provisions granting government officials extraordinary powers and retaining several of the restrictive elements of the state of emergency remained in place. The State of Emergency Inquiry Commission has yet to complete the examination of its caseload in relation to the public employees who were dismissed by decree-laws during the period of emergency rule. In July 2021, Trkiyes Parliament adopted a bill that extends the duration of some of the restrictive elements of the state of emergency for one more year.\n\nThe judiciary continued to systematically target members of the opposition parties in Parliament, in relation to alleged terrorism-related offences. The legal framework for elections and political parties remains problematic. The electoral threshold was lowered from 10% to 7%. Trkiye has not yet addressed the remaining recommendations by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the Venice Commission.\n\nPressure on mayors from opposition parties by the ruling coalition government further weakened local democracy. Mayors from the opposition parties faced administrative and judicial investigations. Local democracy in the south-east remained severely hampered. In the south-east, the forcibly dismissed mayors continued to be replaced by government-appointed trustees.\n\nThe situation in the south-east remained very worrying. In October 2021, Trkiyes Parliament extended the militarys mandate to launch cross-border anti-terror operations in Syria and Iraq by two additional years. The Turkish government continued its domestic and cross-border security and military operations in Iraq and Syria. The security situation remained precarious in border areas with recurrent terrorist acts committed by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which remains on the EU list of persons, groups and entities involved in acts of terrorism. The EU unambiguously condemned the PKKs attacks and expressed solidarity with the families of the victims. The government has a legitimate right and a responsibility to fight terrorism, but it is essential that it does so in accordance with the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. Anti-terror measures need to be proportionate. There were no developments on the resumption of a credible political peace process to achieve a sustainable solution.\n\nSerious backsliding regarding civil society issues continued. Civil society organisations faced increased pressure and their space to operate freely continued to reduce, limiting their freedoms of expression, association and assembly. The implementation of the law on preventing financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction added further restrictions on civil society organisations.\n\nCivilian oversight of the security forces has not been consolidated. Military, police and intelligence services accountability remained very limited. Parliamentary oversight of the security institutions needs to be strengthened. In July, the Parliament extended the retirement age of the Chief of General Staff from 67 to 72 allowing the incumbent Chief of General Staff to serve an additional year while the air and navy commanders have retired.\n\nTrkiye has some level of preparation/is moderately prepared in the field of public administration reform. No progress was made during the reporting period. The country continues to lack a comprehensive reform agenda for public administration and public financial management and the government has not started any comprehensive reform of public administration. The administration's accountability is insufficient, and its human resources management needs to be improved. Policy-making lacks evidence-based methods and participatory mechanisms. The politicisation of the administration continued. Womens representation in civil service managerial posts remained low.\n\nTrkiyes judicial system is at an early stage of preparation. The serious backsliding observed since 2016 continued during the reporting period. Concerns remained, in particular over the systemic lack of independence of the judiciary and undue pressure on judges and prosecutors. Particular concerns relating to the judiciarys adherence to international and European standards increased, in particular in relation to the refusal to implement rulings by the European Court of Human Rights. Implementation of the 2021 human rights action plan and the 2019 judicial reform strategy continued. However, both documents failed to address major shortcomings in the Turkish judiciary, lacking a plan for significant improvements to the overall functioning of the countrys judicial system. Only 515 judges or prosecutors dismissed following the coup attempt were reinstated, despite several being acquitted. The lack of objective, merit-based, standardised and pre-established criteria for recruiting and promoting judges and prosecutors remains a source of concern.\n\nRegarding the fight against corruption, Trkiye remained at an early stage of preparations and made no progress in the reporting period. The country has not set up anti-corruption bodies in line with its international obligations. The legal framework and institutional architecture need to be improved to limit political and undue influence in the prosecution and adjudication of corruption cases. The accountability and transparency of public institutions need to be improved. The absence of an anti-corruption strategy and action plan indicated a lack of will to decisively fight corruption. Most of the Council of Europes Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) recommendations have not been implemented. Overall, corruption is widespread and remains an issue of concern.\n\nTrkiye has some level of preparation in the fight against organised crime, however there was limited progress overall. The completion of an international agreement on the exchange of personal data between Europol and the Turkish authorities responsible for fighting serious crime and terrorism is still pending, as Turkish data protection legislation is not yet in line with the EU acquis. The legal framework regulating the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing needs to be improved in line with recommendations by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and those by the Venice Commission on the law on preventing financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe deterioration of human and fundamental rights continued. Many of the measures introduced during the state of emergency remain in force. The legal framework includes general guarantees of respect for human and fundamental rights, but the legislation and its implementation need to be brought into line with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) case-law. The Council of Europes Parliamentary Assembly continued to monitor Trkiyes respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Trkiyes continued refusal to implement certain ECtHR rulings, notably in the cases of Selahattin Demirta and Osman Kavala, is a source of serious concern regarding the judiciarys adherence to international and European standards and Trkiyes commitment to promote the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights. The infringement procedure started by the Council of Europe against Trkiye in February 2022, for non-implementation of the judgment in the Kavala case has marked yet another benchmark of Trkiyes drifting away from the standards for human rights and fundamental freedoms that it has subscribed to as a member of the Council of Europe. In July, the Court ruled that Trkiye has failed to implement the 2019 ECtHR judgment on the Kavala case.\n\nThe human rights action plan adopted in 2021 continued to be implemented, but this does not address critical issues and has not led to an improvement in the overall human rights situation.\n\nOn freedom of expression, the serious backsliding observed in recent years continued. The implementation of criminal laws relating to national security and anti-terrorism continued to contravene the ECHR and other international standards and to diverge from the case-law of the ECtHR. Restrictive measures implemented by state institutions and increasing pressure with judicial and administrative means continued to undermine the exercise of freedom of expression. There continued to be criminal cases brought against and convictions of journalists, human rights defenders, lawyers, writers, opposition politicians, students, artists and social media users.\n\nThere was further backsliding in the area of freedom of assembly and association. There were recurrent bans, disproportionate use of force and interventions in peaceful demonstrations; investigations, court cases and administrative fines against demonstrators on charges of terrorism-related activities or on violating the law on demonstrations and marches.\n\nThe rights of the most disadvantaged groups and people belonging to minorities need better protection. Roma people remained largely excluded from formal work and their living conditions deteriorated severely. Gender-based violence, discrimination, and hate speech against minorities (in particular against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) persons are still a matter of serious concern.\n\nOn migration and asylum policy, Trkiye made some progress. The EU-Trkiye Statement remained the main framework for cooperation between the EU and Trkiye, and the EUs engagement with Trkiye on migration intensified. Some progress was made on further strengthening capacity for surveillance and protection of the land border with Iran. The return of irregular migrants from the Greek islands under the EU-Trkiye Statement continued to be suspended, as it has been since March 2020. In 2021, numbers of irregular migrants arriving increased on most routes in comparison to 2020. The increase could be partially due to the lifting of measures taken by countries in the region in 2020 to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the number of irregular arrivals in Greece has decreased compared to pre-COVID figures, irregular arrivals to Italy and to the government-controlled areas of Cyprus have increased substantially in the past year and new smuggling routes have been established. Trkiye has still not implemented the provisions relating to third-country nationals in the EU-Trkiye readmission agreement, which entered into force in October 2017. Overall, the number of illegal border crossings between Trkiye and Greece remained significantly lower than it was prior to the adoption of the EU-Trkiye Statement.\n\nTrkiye continued to make significant efforts to host and meet the needs of one of the largest refugee communities in the world. Out of the full operational budget of EUR 6 billion under the Facility for Refugees, over EUR 4.7 billion was disbursed by June 2022. Efficient integration measures are needed to address the extended presence of refugees in the country. Access to public health for migrants and refugees should be improved. No outstanding visa liberalisation benchmarks were fulfilled. Trkiye still needs to further align its legislation with the EU acquis on visa policy.\n\nTrkiyes unilateral foreign policy continued to be at odds with the EU priorities under the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), notably due to its military action in Syria and Iraq and a lack of alignment with EU restrictive measures against Russia. Trkiye maintained a very low alignment rate with the EU stand on foreign and security policy of 7% (as of August 2022). Trkiyes military support to Libya, including the deployment of foreign fighters on the ground, and its persistent criticism of and lack of cooperation with Operation IRINI are detrimental to the EUs effective contribution to implementing the UN arms embargo, and have led to conflicting approaches on Libya. Trkiye remains a critically important actor in the Syrian crisis and shares with the EU the objective of a stable and prosperous Syria. However, its troops maintained a significant presence in the region and in other parts of northern Syria. Trkiyes security concerns stemming from northern Syria should be addressed through political and diplomatic means, not by military action, and in full respect of international humanitarian law.\n\nThe Russian war of aggression against Ukraine was recognised by Trkiye as a state of war and Trkiye condemned the Russian aggression. Trkiye enforced the Montreux Convention, whereby the passage of warships was limited to those returning to their bases. Turkish companies continued to sell military ordnance to Ukraine. Trkiye has aimed to facilitate talks between Ukraine and Russia and working on de-escalation and bringing about a cease-fire. It also undertook a diplomatic initiative to facilitate the export of Ukrainian grain; the deal agreed by Ukraine and Russia on 22 July in Istanbul, facilitated by the UN and Trkiye, would not have been possible without the constructive role of Trkiye, which is also involved in facilitating the implementation of the deal. Nevertheless, Trkiye refrained from aligning with EU sanctions against Russia. Trkiye has signed a Memorandum of Understanding for developing economic and trade relations with Russia.\n\nThe improved dynamic in EU-Trkiye relations observed since December 2020, following the de-escalation in the Eastern Mediterranean, prevailed for several months before tensions in the Aegean resumed in April 2022. In November 2021, following the second review of the framework for restrictive measures, the Council extended the regime for one more year until 12 November 2022. Currently two individuals are subject to sanctions. While there were no unauthorised drilling activities by Trkiye in the Eastern Mediterranean during the reporting period, tensions have been rising. Turkish warships illegally obstructed survey activity in the Cypriot Exclusive Economic Zone. Trkiyes military exercises in the maritime zones of Cyprus continued. Despite the international community, and the EU in particular, condemning Trkiyes unilateral steps, Trkiye continued with its actions to further reopen the fenced-off town of Varosha in Cyprus.\n\nTrkiye needs to commit itself unequivocally to good neighbourly relations, international agreements and to the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter, having recourse, if necessary, to the International Court of Justice.\n\nThe June 2022 European Council expressed deep concern about recent repeated actions and statements by Trkiye. It recalled its previous conclusions and the statement of March 2021 and reiterated that Trkiye must respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all EU Member States. It emphasised that the European Council expects Trkiye to fully respect international law, de-escalate tensions in the interest of regional stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, promote good neighbourly relations in a sustainable way and fully respect international law. The European Council has repeatedly recalled the EUs strategic interest in a stable and secure environment in the Eastern Mediterranean and in the development of a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with Trkiye. The European Council also reaffirmed its readiness to engage with Trkiye in a phased, proportionate and reversible manner in a number of areas of common interest, subject to Trkiye meeting the established conditionalities set out in previous European Council conclusions, and provided that the de-escalation in the Eastern Mediterranean is sustained.\n\nRegarding the economic criteria, the Turkish economy is well advanced, but made no progress over the reporting period. Serious concerns persist over the continued proper functioning of Trkiyes market economy as there has been backsliding on important elements, such as the conduct of monetary policy and the institutional and regulatory environment. The economy recovered strongly from the COVID-19-crisis, growing by 11.4 % in 2021, and more than 7 % in the first half of 2022 despite the fallout of Russias invasion of Ukraine. The country's overly loose monetary policy and lack of policy credibility have weakened the lira and have driven the official inflation to a two-decade high of more than 80%. Higher prices for imported commodities widened external imbalances, which remain a major vulnerability in a situation of increased uncertainty and low level of international reserves. Budget execution outperformed plans but government debt increased, and fiscal policy has come increasingly under pressure, burdened by unsuccessful attempts to curb rising inflation and underpin the domestic currency.\n\nThe institutional and regulatory environment remains fragile, particularly as regards the predictability, transparency, and implementation of regulations. Some important steps were taken to improve the resolution of commercial disputes. Despite a gradual decline, the informal sector still accounts for a significant share of economic activity. State intervention in the price-setting mechanisms persists. The provision of State aid lacks proper implementation rules, enforcement and transparency. The banking sector remained largely stable and capital adequacy above the regulatory requirements. Non-performing loans decreased, and profitability improved, but dollarisation and financial stability risks increased. The labour market recovered from the pandemic but deepseated structural challenges, such as a very significant gender gap, a high rate of youth unemployment, and wide regional disparities remain.\n\nTrkiye has a good level of preparation and has made limited progress during the reporting period in developing its capacity to cope with the competitive pressure and market forces in the EU. Despite some progress in improving vocational training, the mismatch persists between the education system and labour market needs. Expenditure on research and development continued to increase very slowly and remained well below the governments target. Investment activity slowed in the second half of 2021. Progress continued with regard to diversifying energy supplies and increasing the share of energy generated from renewable sources. The extension of local content requirement practices raises concerns. Trkiye removed some of the additional custom duties it had introduced in defiance of the commitments under the EU-Trkiye Custom Union; however, extensive deviations from its obligations under the EU-Trkiye Customs Union hinder bilateral trade.\n\nTrkiye is moderately prepared in the area of public procurement but made no progress over the reporting period and large gaps remained in its alignment with the EU acquis. Trkiye continued its discriminatory domestic price advantage and offset practices favouring local content. Trkiye is moderately prepared in the area of statistics and made limited progress during the reporting period. Frequent managerial changes within the Turkish Statistical Institute over the last few years, including during the reporting period, have significantly undermined the institutions credibility. The reliability of key economic data has been repeatedly called into question. Trkiye has a good level of preparation on financial control, though no progress was made during the reporting period. The Public Internal Financial Control policy paper has not yet been updated and the anti-fraud coordination service (AFCOS) network has not yet been re-established.\n\nRegarding its ability to assume the obligations of membership, Trkiyes alignment with the EU acquis continued to be very limited and pursued on a rather ad hoc basis.\n\nThe internal market cluster is key to the good functioning of the EU-Trkiye Customs Union and to integrating Trkiye into the EUs single market. Preparations in the areas of freedom of movement for workers and right of establishment and freedom to provide services are at an early stage, as many professions are closed to EU nationals. Trkiye has achieved a good level of preparation for the free movement of goods. Technical barriers to trade remained in place. Trkiye is moderately prepared on free movement of capital, as limitations continue on foreign ownership and on capital movement. Trkiye needs to continue to address outstanding issues in its framework regulating the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nTrkiye is well advanced in the area of company law and needs to make further progress in aligning with the EU acquis. Trkiye has a good level of preparation in the area of intellectual property law but needs to improve enforcement. Trkiye has some level of preparation in the area of competition policy. Serious concerns persist in relation to the legislative framework, enforcement capacity and transparency in the field of State aid. Trkiye has a good level of preparation in the area of financial services and made some progress, including with the development of new alternative financing instruments. There is a good level of preparation in terms of legislative alignment of consumer and health protection, with some progress made, notably on aligning with the EU acquis and in strengthening inter-sectoral cooperation.\n\nWithin the cluster on competitiveness and inclusive growth, Trkiye has some level of preparation in the area of digital transformation and media, though it has continued to backslide. Trkiyes preparations in the area of science and research are well advanced and Trkiye made good progress during the reporting period, notably with the conclusion of the association agreement for Horizon Europe for the 2021-2027 period. Trkiye is moderately prepared on education and culture and made some progress, in particular on vocational education, national qualifications systems and in terms of Trkiyes participation in the EU programmes.\n\nOn the economy-related chapters, backsliding continued on economic and monetary policy, reflecting inefficient policy on ensuring price stability and anchoring inflation expectations. The central bank remains under significant political pressure and its functional independence needs to be restored. Trkiye made limited progress on enterprise and industrial policy, and major challenges in relation to measures incompatible with EU industrial policy principles remain unaddressed. No progress was made during the reporting period in the area of social policy and employment, with concerns remaining over trade union rights, the lack of genuine social dialogue and persistent levels of informal economic activity.\n\nWhile Trkiye is moderately prepared on taxation, it made no progress during the reporting period and there remains a need for a clear strategy, avoiding frequent changes in tax rates and enabling tax information exchange with all EU Member States. Trkiye maintains a good level of preparation for the customs union but made limited progress, notably by removing some additional duties applied on imports of products originating in third countries. However, Trkiyes deviations from its obligations under the EU-Trkiye Customs Union continue, contributing to a high number of trade irritants.\n\nRegarding the cluster on the Green Agenda and sustainable connectivity, Trkiye is moderately prepared in transport policy. It made limited progress during the reporting period, mainly linked to the adoption of a plan to significantly increase the use of railway transport. Trkiye is moderately prepared in the area of energy and made limited progress overall. Progress continued on renewable energy deployment, on reforms in the natural gas sector and in legislative alignment on nuclear safety. Trkiye is well advanced on trans-European networks and made some progress, mainly on energy networks, thanks to the smooth operation of the trans-Anatolian pipeline. The construction of the Halkali-Kapikule railway line connecting the Bulgarian border to Istanbul continued. Trkiye has some level of preparation in the area of environment and climate change, but made no progress overall during the reporting period. Trkiye faces critical environmental and climate challenges, both in relation to mitigation and adaptation. More ambitious and better coordinated environment and climate policies need to be drawn up and implemented. Trkiye still needs to increase and implement its contribution to the Paris Agreement on climate change and complete its alignment with the acquis on climate action.\n\nOn the cluster covering resources, agriculture and cohesion, Trkiye reached some level of preparation in the area of agriculture and rural development. Backsliding continued during the reporting period, as its agricultural policy keeps moving away from the main principles of the EU common agricultural policy and Trkiye continued to restrict imports of agricultural products from the EU. Trkiye is a major exporter of food products to the EU and made limited progress during the reporting period in the area of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy. Full implementation of the EU acquis in this area requires significant further work. Trkiye is moderately prepared in the area of fisheries and continued to make good progress, notably as regards the implementation of the new fisheries law, resources and fleet management, and inspection and control. Trkiye is moderately prepared in the area of regional policy and the coordination of structural instruments and continued to make some progress on accelerating the absorption of IPA II funds. Trkiye has some level of preparation in the area of financial and budgetary provisions, but made no progress during the reporting period.\n\nIn the external relations cluster, Trkiye is moderately prepared in the area of external relations and made limited progress in the reporting period, notably due to continued deviation from the Common Customs Tariff. Divergence from the EU Generalised Scheme of Preferences persisted, in violation of the EU-Trkiye Customs Union. Trkiyes official development assistance was largely directed towards humanitarian support for the Syria-related activities on Trkiyes own territory. Trkiye has some level of preparation in the area of foreign, security and defence policy. Overall, Trkiyes foreign policy continued to be at odds with the EU priorities under the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). Trkiyes non-alignment with EU restrictive measures against Russia is of particular concern due to the free circulation of products, including dual use goods, within the EU-Trkiye Customs Union. This creates a risk of undermining EU restrictive measures. For the Customs Union to continue functioning the parties must fully respect existing rules and avoid undermining mutual trust.\n\nOverall, in many areas, significant further work is needed on legislative alignment with the EU acquis. In all areas, implementation and enforcement needs substantial improvement. Ensuring the independence of regulatory authorities and developing administrative capacity are key for Trkiye to achieve further progress.\n\nKey dates\n\nSeptember 1959: Trkiye applies for associate membership of the European Economic Community (EEC).\n\nSeptember 1963: Signature of the Association Agreement, aiming at enhancing economic cooperation and achieving a Customs Union between Trkiye and the EEC.\n\nApril 1987: Trkiye presents its formal application for membership of the European Economic Community.\n\nJanuary 1995: EU-Trkiye Agreement creating a Customs Union.\n\nDecember 1999: The European Council recognises Trkiye as a candidate country.\n\nDecember 2004: The European Council agrees to start accession negotiations with Trkiye.\n\nOctober 2005: Start of accession negotiations.\n\nDecember 2006: The Council decides that eight negotiating chapters cannot be opened and no chapter can be closed until Trkiye meets its obligation of full, non-discriminatory implementation of the additional protocol to the Association Agreement.\n\nDecember 2013: The EU-Trkiye readmission agreement is signed in parallel with the launching of the visa liberalisation dialogue.\n\nOctober 2014: The EU-Trkiye readmission agreement enters into force.\n\nMarch 2015: The European Commission and Trkiye launch a high-level energy dialogue.\n\nMay 2015: The European Commission and Trkiye agree to modernise the 20-year-old Customs Union Agreement and to enhance EU-Trkiye bilateral trade relations.\n\nNovember 2015: On the occasion of the EU-Trkiye Leaders' Meeting, both sides agree on the activation of a Joint Action Plan aiming at ending the irregular migration from Trkiye to the EU, in full compliance with EU and international standards.\n\nMarch 2016: The EU and Trkiye agree on a joint Statement on the basis of the Joint Action Plan of November 2015.\n\nMay 2016: The third Report on progress by Trkiye in fulfilling the requirements of its visa liberalisation roadmap is published.\n\nDecember 2016: The European Commission adopts a recommendation for opening negotiations with Trkiye on the modernisation of the Customs Union.\n\nJune 2018: The General Affairs Council decides that Trkiye's accession negotiations have effectively come to a standstill and no further chapters can be considered for opening or closing due to Trkiye moving further away from the European Union.\n\nNovember 2018: The EU-Trkiye high-level political dialogue takes place in Ankara.\n\nMarch 2019: The 54th EU-Trkiye Association Council takes place in Brussels.\n\nNovember 2019: The EU adopts a framework for targeted measures against Trkiye for its illegal drilling activities in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nMarch 2020: EU-Trkiye Leaders' meeting takes place in Brussels.\n\nJuly 2020: The EU adopts an additional package of 485 million to continue the EU's two flagship humanitarian programmes supporting refugees in Trkiye, on top of the 6 billion of the Facility for Refugees.\n\nApril 2021: The Presidents of the European Council and of the European Commission meet the President of Trkiye in Ankara.\n\nMarch 2021: The European Council expresses the EU's readiness to engage with Trkiye in a phased, proportionate and reversible manner to enhance cooperation in a number of areas of common interest.\n\nJune 2021: The European Commission proposes to allocate 3 billion in additional assistance to Syrian refugees and host communities in Trkiye.\n\nOctober 2021: The EUTrkiye high-level dialogue on migration and security takes place in Ankara.\n\nNovember 2021: The EU-Trkiye high-level dialogue on health takes place.\n\nMarch 2022: The 80th EU-Trkiye Joint Parliamentary Committee takes place in Brussels.\n\nApril 2022: The second EU-Trkiye high- level dialogue on climate takes place in Ankara, following the first meeting of the dialogue in September 2021 in Brussels.\n\nMay 2022: The EU-Trkiye high- level dialogue on agriculture takes place in Ankara.\n\nMay 2022: The EU-Trkiye political directors meeting takes place in Ankara.\n\nFor More Information\n\nTrkiye Report 2022\n\n2022 Communication on EU Enlargement Policy\n\nTrkiye Factograph\n\nEU Accession Process\n\nPress contacts :\n\nAna PISONERO (+32 2295 43 20)\n\nZoi MULETIER (+32 229-94306)\n\nFor the public: Europe Direct by phone 00 800 6 7 8 9 10 11 or by email",

                "cc_text": "Moscow has suspended its implementation of a U.N.-brokered grain export deal that has allowed more than 9 million tons of grain to be exported from Ukraine, helping to ease the global food crisis and lower prices.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense said it would no longer guarantee the safety of cargo ships participating in the U.N.-led initiative, citing as the reason for its exit an alleged Ukrainian drone attack against Russias Black Sea Fleet ships anchored off the coast of occupied Crimea. Russia said the attack took place early Saturday; Ukraine has denied the attack.\n\n\"In connection with the actions of Ukrainian armed forces... the Russian side cannot guarantee the safety of civilian dry cargo ships participating in the Black Sea initiative, and suspends its implementation from today for an indefinite period,'' the Russian statement said.\n\nThe Russian declaration came one day after U.N. chief Antonio Guterres urged Russia and Ukraine to renew the grain deal.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the Russian move \"predictable.\" He accused Moscow of \"blockading\" ships carrying grain since September, The Associated Press reported. Currently, he said, 176 vessels are backed up at sea, carrying more than 2 million tons of food.\n\n\"This is a transparent attempt by Russia to return to the threat of large-scale famine in Africa and Asia,\" Zelenskyy said Saturday in his nightly video address. He called for a tough response against Russia from international bodies like the U.N. and the G-20.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Delaware Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden called Russias decision to suspend its participation from the Ukrainian grain deal \"purely outrageous\" and said it would increase starvation.\n\n\"There's no merit to what they're doing. The U.N. negotiated that deal and that should be the end of it,\" Biden said.\n\nIn a comment Saturday, U.N. Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the United Nations is in touch with the Russian authorities on the matter.\n\n\"It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people around the world,\" Dujarric said.\n\nThe Joint Coordination Center, which implements the grain deal, in a statement released Saturday, said it \"is reviewing recent developments, assessing the impact on JCCs operations and is discussing next steps.\"\n\nUkraines foreign minister accused Moscow of using a \"false pretext\" Saturday to suspend its participation in the Black Sea grain corridor.\n\nDmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter, \"I call on all states to demand Russia to stop its hunger games and recommit to its obligations.\"\n\nDmitry Polyansky, Russias first deputy representative to the U.N., also said Saturday that Russia had requested a meeting Monday of the U.N. Security Council because of the alleged attack on the Black Sea Fleet and the security of the grain corridor, the AP reported.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry accused the British royal navy of blowing up the Nord Stream gas pipelines last month. Moscow did not provide any evidence to back up its claims that a leading NATO member had sabotaged critical Russian infrastructure that delivers much needed gas to Europe.\n\nLondon denied the claims and responded Saturday, saying on Twitter, \"To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defense is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.\"\n\nRussia claims that \"British specialists\" from the same unit that took part in the planning, provision, and implementation of a terrorist attack in the Baltic Sea on September 26 also directed Ukrainian drones against Russia ships in Crimea early Saturday.\n\n\"Today at 4:20 a.m., the Kyiv regime carried out a terrorist attack on ships of the Black Sea Fleet and civilian ships that were on the outer and inner roadsteads [protected bodies of water] of the Sevastopol base,\" Igor Konashenkov, chief spokesman of the Russian Defense Ministry said. He added that the air targets were destroyed by Russia forces.\n\nKonashenkov asserted the Black Sea Fleet ships that were attacked were there to secure \"the grain corridor\" as part of the international initiative to export agricultural products from Ukrainian ports.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Swedish lead prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said in reference to the damaged gas pipeline, \"I've decided together with the security police to carry out a number of additional investigations at the scene of the crime.\" Swedish armed forces are scouting the area around the two damaged Nord Stream pipelines with minesweepers.\n\nSweden and Denmark have both concluded that four leaks on Nord Stream 1 and 2 were caused by explosions, but they have not said who might be responsible. World leaders have called it an act of sabotage.\n\nElsewhere, Russian authorities in the occupied territories of Ukraine are dismantling the regions health care systems, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his daily address Friday.\n\n\"The occupiers have decided to close medical institutions in the cities, take away equipment, ambulances - just everything. ... They put pressure on the doctors who still remained in the occupied areas for them to move to the territory of Russia,\" the president said.\n\n\"Russia is turning the Kherson region into a zone without civilization, without elementary things available in most countries of the world,\" said Zelenskyy. \"Before the arrival of Russia, this region, like all other regions of Ukraine, was completely normal and safe, all social services for people were guaranteed there. ... Life was guaranteed there.\"\n\n\"And now Russia is trying to make the Kherson region literally an exclusion zone,\" the president said. \"The world must react to this.\"\n\nThe Kherson region was also the focus of Britains Defense Ministrys intelligence update Saturday. The report said that earlier in the week, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-appointed governor of the Kherson region, claimed more than 70,000 people had left Kherson city.\n\nThe update said Saldo also claimed that \"Russia had removed the remains of a well-known 18th century Russian statesman, Prince Grigory Potemkin, from his tomb in Kherson's cathedral to east of the Dnipro.\"\n\n\"In the Russian national identity,\" the report said, \"Potemkin is heavily associated with the Russian conquest of Ukrainian lands in the 18th century and highlights the weight Putin almost certainly places on perceived historical justification for the invasion.\"\n\nVOA U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this story. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "Iran has reportedly deepened its commitment to supplying arms for Russias war on Ukraine by agreeing to provide Moscow with medium-range surface to surface missiles as well as more military drones.\n\nPublications including the Guardian reported the scenario, as briefed by US and Iranian security officials, on October 18, as Ukraine endured more attacks on its energy infrastructure from what were believed to be GPS-guided Shahed-136 \"kamikaze\" drones supplied to Russia by Iran.\n\n[video]\n\nRussia is thought to be attempting to systematically destroy Ukraines electricity infrastructure ahead of winter. But its stocks of its own missiles are depleted.\n\nUK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on October 18 flew to Washington at short notice. It is thought Wallace will discuss the dangerous new phase in the Ukraine war, share intelligence on Irans involvement and assess with US counterparts what package of new air defence could be delivered to Ukraine.\n\nReuters cited an Iranian official briefed on an October trip of Iranian officials to Moscow as saying: \"The Russians had asked for more drones and those Iranian ballistic missiles with improved accuracy, particularly the Fateh and Zolfaghar missiles family.\"\n\nThe two short-range missiles are said to be capable of hitting targets at distances of 300km (185 miles) and 700km (435 miles), respectively.\n\nShahed-136 drones seen in their launch container during a demonstration in Iran (Credit: Creative Commons).\n\nIran on October 19 again denied it was selling drones to Russia. Tehran called for talks with Ukraine to \"resolve\" the accusations.\n\nUkraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has concluded that Kyiv should break off all diplomatic ties with Tehran. He said Ukraine would not tolerate Irans \"meanness and lies\" on the issue of military supplies provided to Russia.\n\nIrans foe, Israel, has been approached by the Ukrainians about selling Kyiv air defence systems. On October 16, Israels Minister of Diaspora Affairs, Major General Nachman Shai, wrote on Twitter: \"It was reported this morning that Iran is transferring ballistic missiles to Russia. There is no longer any doubt about what position Israel should take in this bloody conflict. The time has come for Ukraine to receive military assistance.\"\n\nUkrainian intelligence has said around 1,750 drones, each costing only around $20,000 to manufacture, had so far been delivered to Russia by Iran.\n\nThe Shahed-136 can be fired from a truck. It flies relatively slowly, but at a low height. It can be hard to detect until the last minute.\n\nRussia appears to have \"re-branded\" the drones as \"Russian\", using winglet markings reading Geran-2 (Geranium-2).\n\nIn the past week alone, more than 100 self-destructing Iranian-made drones have slammed into power plants, sewage treatment plants, residential buildings and bridges, among other targets, in urban areas, according to Ukraines Foreign Ministry.\n\nA Western official, speaking with The Associated Press on October 18, on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence, said Russia was pursuing a strategy of \"attempting to destroy Ukraines electricity network\" with long-range strikes.\n\nThe official said the Iranian drones \"are playing an increasingly significant role, although we can see that Ukraine is effectively neutralizing many of them before they hit their targets.\"",

The country has also recently criticised the deal, saying its own grain exports have suffered due to Western sanctions.\n\nReacting to Russia's accusations, the MoD today said: 'To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale. This invented story, says more about arguments going on inside the Russian Government than it does about the west.'\n\nThe Turkey and UN-brokered deal to unlock grain exports signed between Russia and Ukraine in July is critical to easing the global food crisis caused by the conflict.\n\nThe agreement had already allowed more than nine million tonnes of Ukrainian grain to be exported and was due to be renewed on November 19.\n\nIn an earlier statement, Russia'a defence ministry said: 'In light of the terrorist act carried out by the Kyiv regime with the participation of British experts against ships of the Black Sea fleet and civilian vessels involved in the security of grain corridors, Russia suspends its participation in the implementation of the agreement on the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports.'\n\nThe Kremlin has now requested a UN Security Council meeting on Monday following the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's decision to suspend its participation in the grain agreement was today described by US President as outrageous.\n\nAnd Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky questioned how Russia can be a member of the G20 if it is 'deliberately trying to provoke starvation'. In a video address, he accused the Kremlin of trying to create an artificial famine in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nHe also called the move 'predictable', adding that Moscow has been 'blockading' ships carrying grain since September. Currently, he said, 176 vessels are backed up at sea, carrying more than two million tons of food.\n\nThe explosions of the Nord Stream pipelines in September caused four gas leaks. While the leaks were in international waters, two of them were in the Danish exclusive economic zone and two of them in the Swedish\n\nIncredible video footage from a Ukrainian underwater drone appears to show the Russian Black Sea flagship, Admiral Makarov\n\nThe exhilarating footage showed the underwater Ukrainian drone racing through the key naval port of Sevastopol - the largest city in Crimea\n\nThe underwater drones have been previously speculated as being involved in the explosion of the Kerch bridge in Crimea on October 8 - the day after Vladimir Putin's birthday\n\nUnconfirmed reports have suggested that frigate Admiral Makarov - the Black Sea Flagship - had been blown up (pictured)\n\nThe European Union is supporting UN-led efforts to keep the Ukraine grain deal alive, a spokesperson said on Saturday.\n\nNabila Massrali, spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy at the European Commission, said: We stress that all parties must refrain from any unilateral action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people around the world.'\n\nSevastopol in Moscow-annexed Crimea, which has been targeted several times in recent months, serves as the headquarters for the fleet and a logistical hub for operations in Ukraine.\n\nFurious Moscow forces alleged British 'specialists', whom they said were based in the southern Ukrainian city of Ochakiv, had helped prepare and train Kyiv to carry out the strike.\n\nIn a further singling out of the UK - which Moscow sees as one of the most unfriendly Western countries - Russia said the same British unit was involved in explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines last month. A claim refuted by British officials.\n\nExtraordinary footage has emerged showing Russian troops on board firing wildly at the drone as it races towards what is believed to be the Admiral Makarov frigate, which replaced the Moskva as the Black Sea Fleet's flagship.\n\nThe underwater Ukrainian drone can be seen racing through the key naval port of Sevastopol - the largest city in Crimea - while panicking Russian troops on ships and helicopters attempt to destroy it.\n\nThe exhilarating footage taken from a camera within the drone shows the underwater weapon riding through the waves and dodging bullets which can be seen penetrating the surface.\n\nA helicopter can then be seen racing into shot as desperate Russians attempt to respond before it continues to fire at the maritime drone.\n\nThe underwater drones have been previously speculated as being involved in the explosion of the Kerch bridge in Crimea on October 8 - the day after Vladimir Putin's birthday. In response to the bridge blast, Putin unleashed a barrage of missile strikes across Ukraine, striking civilian centres.\n\nMikhail Razvozhayev, the Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, said the drone attack was the 'most massive' the peninsula had seen. The city's services were on 'alert', but he claimed no 'civilian infrastructure' had been damaged.\n\nCity authorities said that the harbour was 'temporarily' closed to boats and ferries and urged people \"not to panic\".\n\nAttacks on Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, have increased in recent weeks, as Kyiv presses a counter-offensive in the south to retake territory held by Moscow for months.\n\nMoscow-installed authorities in Kherson, just north of Crimea, have vowed to turn the city into a fortress, preparing for an inevitable assault.\n\nOn Thursday, Razvozhayev said a thermal power station had been attacked in Balaklava, in the Sevastopol area. He claimed there was only minor damage and no casualties.\n\nIt comes on a day which has seen Russia seek revenge for a drone attack that hit Sevastopol in the early hours of the morning.\n\nRussian Black Sea warships were forced to fight Kyiv forces in an attack that Russian Ministry of Defence branded a 'terrorist attack'. Moscow claimed that they destroyed nine aerial drones and seven maritime drones.\n\nMikhail Razvozhayev, Russian governor of Sevastopol, said the attack in the early hours of the morning caused no damage to city infrastructure but later the Ministry of Defence conceded that at least one vessel sustained minor damage.\n\nA second video showed a massive explosion after Ukrainian forces attacked the naval port in Crimea, sending Russia into disarray\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defence conceded that at least one Russian vessel was damaged in the attacks - thought to be the flagship\n\nAlthough Ukraine has not confirmed these attacks, Kyiv sources claim that several of the Russian ships from the fleet were blown up, including the frigate Admiral Makarov.\n\nBefore Russia halted the grain deal, the Ministry had threatened on Telegram: 'It should be emphasised that the ships of the Black Sea Fleet that were subjected to the terrorist attack are involved in ensuring the security of the 'grain corridor' as part of an international initiative to export agricultural products from Ukrainian ports.'\n\nBritain strongly rebutted claims they were involved, saying 'the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.'\n\nThe British defence ministry said that this 'invented story says more about arguments going on inside the Russian Government than it does about the West'.\n\nEarlier today Razvozhayev said: 'Black Sea Fleet ships are fighting off a drone attack in Sevastopol Bay.' he said.\n\n'No damage has been reported in the city. The situation is under control. All response services are at the ready.'\n\nA student dormitory at an art college near the port saw 'one windowpane burst' but 'no harm was done', he added.\n\nResidents claimed that the huge explosions 'shook' their homes and windows while black smoke was seen rising from the docks area.\n\nDramatic footage purportedly showed a Moscow attack helicopter destroying an 'underwater drone' in Omega Bay.\n\nThe video showed the helicopter hovering above the object in the water before it bursts into flames with smoke billowing out of it.\n\nThe underwater object thought to be a drone was said to be tailing a warship before it was reportedly destroyed by the Russian helicopter.\n\nMissiles were fired from the helicopter which also unleashed volleys of machine gun fire.\n\nRussian sources claimed its air defenced deployed from naval warships were forced to repel a sustained Ukrainian attack that started at 4.30am and lasted for at least five hours.\n\nAt least one Russian warship was damaged during a 'massive' Ukrainian drone assault as huge explosions rocked a key Crimean port, the Moscow Ministry of Defence revealed\n\nDramatic footage showed a Moscow attack helicopter destroying an 'underwater drone' in Omega Bay earlier this afternoon\n\nThe Kremlin has also blamed a US Global Hawk (RQ-4B) which 'flew from Italy' for flying over the Black Sea and monitoring Russian responses to the concerted Ukrainian onslaught.\n\nAll passenger ferry services were suspended in the strategic port which is the HQ of Putin's Black Sea Fleet.\n\nIt marks what could be the most audacious attack so far by Ukraine on Russian naval assets in Sevastopol.\n\nEarlier this week, Razvozhayev said that a drone had attacked a thermal power station near Sevastopol.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian fleet stationed in the port had also been attacked by a drone in July.\n\nSo far, attempts to verify Razvozhayev's claims that no damage has been done have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe Russian statesman begged locals not to post footage of the attacks, claiming that it could aid the Kyiv regime.\n\n'A big request is not to write what-where-how much you saw and heard,' he posted.\n\n'And do not upload videos. It should be clear to everyone that such data is very necessary for the UkroNazis in order to understand how the defence of our city is arranged.'\n\nAccording to Ukrainian sources, several of the Russian ships from the fleet were blown up in the early hours of Saturday morning\n\nLocal media were reporting that rescuers in the late morning were still attempting to put out a fire on one of the ships\n\nPlumes of smoke were visible after Ukrainian drone strikes in the middle of the night - Russia say they had to destroy nine drones and seven maritime drones\n\nMassive explosions have been seen hitting a key naval port in annexed Crimea that Russia claim was targeted in a major Ukrainian drone assault\n\nMikhail Razvozhayev, Russian governor of Sevastopol, said: 'No damage has been reported in the city.\n\nHowever, this did not fail to prevent residents reporting the explosions that unfolded in the middle of the nights.\n\nOne resident reported: 'Woke up at 4 a.m. to a massive explosion. Thank goodness it's [our] air defences.\n\n'Our ships in Sevastopol Bay were repelling a drone attack.\n\n'It was a fun night, even very fun.'\n\nAnother stated: 'Woke up to an explosion at 5:30am. Followed some time later by three more'.\n\nA third added: 'Ten minutes ago three explosions sounded, and shook the house'\n\nMeanwhile, another comment said: 'Woke up this morning to explosions.\n\n'Never heard anything like that before. It thundered so hard that the windows shook in the flat.'\n\nThe attack comes as Russia appears to have largely given up attacking Ukraine and has been forced on to the defensive after Putin's military got mauled by Kyiv's armies.\n\nEarlier this week, Razvozhayev (pictured) said that a drone had attacked a thermal power station near Sevastopol\n\nRussia also blamed a US Global Hawk (RQ-4B) which 'flew from Italy' for flying over the Black Sea and monitoring Russian responses to the concerted Ukrainian onslaught\n\nRussian troops have been forced on to the defensive across almost the entire frontline in Ukraine after Putin's army was mauled, British intelligence said yesterday\n\nSeverely undermanned and poorly trained Russian units have stopped advancing across most of the front line in the last six weeks, British intelligence said yesterday.\n\nUkrainian forces advance in both the north and south of the country - pushing east from Kharkiv into Luhansk and advancing towards Kherson.\n\nIn Kherson, companies of soldiers which should consist of 100 men were fighting with just six to eight troops each, Ministry of Defence analysts added.\n\nWhile Putin is attempting to bolster these units with conscripted troops, Russia is unlikely to be able to resume its offensive in the near future.\n\nEarlier this week, it had appeared that Russia was preparing to withdraw from Kherson city but Ukraine now believes Putin is actually reinforcing it.\n\nKyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence service, said earlier this week that Russia has been evacuating civilians but is moving military reinforcements into urban areas, preparing defences, and plans to fight for the city.\n\nHe added that the evacuation and talk of a retreat by Russia's top commander may have been an effort to lure Ukraine into a costly urban battle.",

Dirty bombs combine conventional explosives with radioactive material, like uranium, and are considered more accessible to terrorists because they are less technically complex than nuclear weapons and are intended to contaminate areas with radiation, potentially causing economic and psychological damage rather than immediate mass casualties (1,2). This potential for disruption without the need for sophisticated technology makes dirty bombs an attractive option for terrorists looking to sow terror and cause long-term harm to urban centers (1,2,8).\n\nIn contrast, the likelihood of state-sponsored use of dirty bombs is generally considered lower, as countries typically have access to more powerful conventional and strategic weapons. However, Russia's recent accusations against Ukraine of planning to use a dirty bomb, which have been dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies as a possible false-flag operation, illustrate that the threat of states leveraging such allegations for strategic purposes cannot be entirely dismissed (3,4,5). While Ukraine invited UN inspectors to prove they have nothing to hide, the Russian claim has raised concerns about escalation and the potential for misuse of dirty bomb rhetoric in international conflicts (3,4). Despite these concerns, the intentional contamination of one's own land with a dirty bomb seems an unlikely and irrational act for a state, particularly one under the threat of invasion, as it would cause long-term damage to their own environment and population (4)."

                "summary": "A dirty bomb is a device that combines conventional explosives with radioactive material, intended to disperse the material upon explosion, rather than initiating a nuclear reaction (2). Unlike a nuclear weapon, which can kill people and cause severe illness due to its immense explosive power and widespread radiation, a dirty bomb's primary aim is to contaminate an area and create panic, with its radiological effects being much more localized (1,3). The radiation from a dirty bomb is expected to spread only over a few blocks or miles, significantly less than the hundreds of square miles affected by a nuclear blast (3,4). Despite these differences, the suggestion of the use of a dirty bomb in conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine situation, highlights the concern for potential \"nuclear terrorism\" and the severe consequences of land contamination (5).",
                "more_detailed": "A dirty bomb, also known as a radiological dispersal device (RDD), is a weapon that combines conventional explosives with radioactive material, designed to contaminate an area with radiation rather than cause widespread destruction through blast effects (1,10). Unlike a nuclear weapon, which leverages nuclear fission or fusion to release massive amounts of energy and has the capability to cause immense immediate destruction and long-term radioactive fallout over hundreds of square miles, a dirty bomb is primarily intended to spread fear and panic, and its physical effects are generally limited to a few square miles at most (2,4). The radioactive materials used in a dirty bomb could be sourced from hospitals, nuclear power stations, or research laboratories, and do not require the high refinement necessary for nuclear bombs (1).\n\nThe potential impact of a dirty bomb is more psychological and localized, focusing on creating panic and rendering areas uninhabitable due to radiological contamination, rather than causing mass casualties (2,3,7). This type of device is often associated with acts of terrorism, since it is more accessible and easier to make compared to a nuclear bomb, and is designed to cause disruption rather than large-scale physical destruction (6). While the radiation from a dirty bomb could disperse over a few blocks or miles, causing some environmental contamination, it is not comparable to the widespread devastation and loss of life that would result from a nuclear explosion (3,4). Furthermore, the use of such a bomb by a state actor is unlikely, as no military is known to have included dirty bombs in their arsenal, indicating their limited utility in conventional warfare (10)."

The Cuban Missile Crisis illustrates how false-flag operations or escalations in conflict can force negotiations, a dynamic that might be relevant if Russia seeks to create a stalemate in Ukraine, potentially using false-flag operations as leverage for talks (5).",
                "summary": "False-flag operations have historical precedents, such as the allegations by Russia that Ukraine is planning to use a dirty bomb, which Kyiv and Western allies dismiss as a potential false-flag operation to justify escalation in the ongoing conflict (3,4). Terrorist organizations, too, have been reported to attempt the construction of dirty bombs, although no successful detonation has been recorded (1). The UN's nuclear watchdog has been proactive in addressing such concerns by agreeing to send inspectors to Ukraine, highlighting the seriousness with which these allegations are taken at the international level (2). The Cuban Missile Crisis offers an example of how false-flag operations or similar high-stake situations can sometimes lead to negotiations, suggesting that in the case of Ukraine, a negotiated solution might become more likely if a stalemate is reached, with historical lessons indicating the need for a balance of power and concessions (5).",
                "more_detailed": "Historical precedents for false-flag operations in international conflicts suggest that such tactics are employed to deceive and generate a pretext for escalation or direct engagement in warfare (3,6). The recent accusations by Russia claiming Ukraine's plans to use a dirty bomb can be perceived as a potential false-flag operation, a narrative firmly dismissed by Ukraine and its Western allies (3,4). The concept of a false-flag operation is not new; it has been utilized in the past to manipulate public perception and justify military actions (6). The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 is an example where the superpowers engaged in brinkmanship, yet they managed to resolve the crisis through dialogue and negotiation, avoiding the use of nuclear weapons (5,6). This historical event underscores the importance of careful diplomatic engagement in defusing potentially catastrophic military confrontations.\n\nIn the current geopolitical climate, the allegations of a dirty bomb by Russia raise concerns of a false-flag operation that could be used to escalate the conflict in Ukraine (3,4). These claims come at a time when Russia has faced significant setbacks on the battlefield and has engaged in military exercises that have heightened tensions with the West (7,9). Comparatively, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union ultimately chose negotiation over conflict, a lesson that suggests the potential value of diplomatic channels in resolving the Ukraine crisis and averting a nuclear confrontation (5,6,10). The international community remains vigilant, monitoring the situation closely for any signs of escalation to nuclear weapon use, which would have severe global implications (9,10)."

Kuleba specifically requested that IAEA experts be \"urgently sent\" to peaceful facilities that Russia falsely claims are being used to develop such weapons, further underlining Ukraine's commitment to transparency (7).\n\nIn addition to inviting UN inspectors, Ukraine has also garnered support from its Western allies, who have echoed Kyiv's denials and labeled Russia's accusations as \"transparently false\" (6). The IAEA has subsequently confirmed its intention to send inspectors to two Ukrainian sites, as mentioned in Russia's allegations, to carry out verifications of any undeclared nuclear activities and materials (7,8).

Ukrainian officials have repeatedly denied Moscow's accusations and Kyiv's foreign minister has invited UN inspectors to visit Ukraine to show they \"have nothing to hide.\" Here's what else you need to know: What is a dirty bomb? A dirty bomb is a weapon that combines conventional explosives like dynamite and radioactive material like uranium. It is often referred to as a weapon for terrorists, not countries, as it is designed to spread fear and panic more than eliminate any military target. What is Russia saying? Without providing any evidence, Moscow claims there are scientific institutions in Ukraine housing the technology needed to create a dirty bomb and accuses Kyiv of planning to use it. The Russian Defense Ministry said in a briefing on Oct. 24 it has information that shows Kyiv is planning a provocation related to the detonation of a dirty bomb. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu made the claim in a call with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Oct. 23, according to a US official familiar with the conversation. Shoigu also made similar comments to his French and British counterparts. What are other countries saying? Russia's allegations have been strongly refuted by Ukraine, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and NATO, which have in turn accused Moscow of trying to launch its own false-flag operation. The White House said on Oct. 24 it is \"monitoring as best we can\" any potential preparations for use of a dirty bomb in Ukraine but doesn't see anything to indicate the imminent use of such a weapon. Is a dirty bomb a nuclear weapon? No. The blast from a dirty bomb is generated by conventional explosives. The blast from a nuclear weapon is generated by a nuclear reaction, such as theatomic bombs the US dropped on Japan in World War II. \"A nuclear bomb creates an explosion that is thousands to millions of times more powerful than any conventional explosive that might be used in a dirty bomb,\" according to a fact sheet from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Has a dirty bomb ever been used? No. In 1995, Chechen rebels planted but failed to detonate one in a Moscow park, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. There have been reports that terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS have built or tried to build a dirty bomb, but none has ever been detonated. Read more about this here.",

The blast from a nuclear weapon is generated by a nuclear reaction, such as the atomic bombs the US dropped on Japan in World War II.\n\n\"A nuclear bomb creates an explosion that is thousands to millions of times more powerful than any conventional explosive that might be used in a dirty bomb,\" according to a fact sheet from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nThe blast from a nuclear weapon can flatten entire cities. For instance, the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945 obliterated 2.6 square miles (6.2 square kilometers) of the city, according to ICAN, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. The conventional explosives in a dirty bomb may only flatten or damage a few buildings.\n\nMeanwhile, the mushroom cloud from a nuclear explosion could cover tens to hundreds of square miles, spreading fine particles of nuclear material radioactive fallout over that area, DHS says.\n\nMost of the radioactive material from a dirty bomb would be spread over a few city blocks or a few square miles, according to DHS.\n\nHas a dirty bomb ever been used?\n\nNo.\n\nIn 1995, Chechen rebels planted but failed to detonate one in a Moscow park, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nThere have been reports that terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS have built or tried to build a dirty bomb, but none has ever been detonated.\n\nIs the nuclear material in a dirty bomb deadly?\n\nThe DHS says it would be unlikely a dirty bomb could deliver high enough doses of radiation \"to cause immediate health effects or fatalities in a large number of people.\"\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services explains why.\n\nTo make a dirty bomb capable of delivering deadly doses of radiation, large amounts of shielding from lead or steel would be needed to keep the material from killing its makers during construction, it says.\n\nBut using such shielding material would make the bomb bulky and hard to move or deploy, probably requiring heavy equipment and remote handling tools, and it would limit how far the radiation could spread, according to the Texas state agency.\n\nWhat about radiation exposure?\n\nThe radiation generated by a dirty bomb would cause similar levels of exposure to the amount received during dental X-rays, according to Texas health services.\n\n\"It is like breaking up a rock. If someone was to throw a large rock at you it would probably hurt and it may cause you physical damage,\" the department explains. \"If they take the same rock and break it up into grains of sand and then they throw the sand at you, the chances of it causing you any real damage are significantly lower.\"\n\nThe severity of radiation sickness is affected by exposure over time, according to the DHS. Preventative measures can be as simple as walking away.\n\n\"Walking even a short distance from the scene (of the explosion) could provide significant protection since dose rate drops dramatically with distance from the source,\" DHS says.\n\nPeople should also cover noses and mouths to avoid ingesting any radiation, get indoors to escape any dust cloud, discard their clothing in a plastic bag and then gently wash their skin to remove contaminants, the DHS says.",

No member of the Nicaraguan Government nor anyone who facilitates the Ortega-Murillo regimes abuses should believe they can travel freely to the United States.\n\nToday the White House also announced an amendment to Executive Order 13851 which expands sanctions authorities, including certain trade-related measures, for Nicaragua. These new authorities support our efforts to promote accountability for the regimes accelerating actions to close all space for civil society, to increase its security cooperation with Russia, and to silence independent voices despite broad international calls for dialogue and moderation.\n\nGovernments that deny their peoples basic rights or threaten the security interests of their neighbors should not expect that their political, economic, and trade relationships with the United States will remain unaffected. Pursuant to Executive Order 13851, the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on Nicaraguan mining authority, General Directorate of Mines or DGM an office within the Ministry of Energy and Mines and on Reinaldo Gregorio Lenin Cerna Juarez, a close confidante of the Nicaraguan president.\n\nThe United States, together with our allies and partners, believes that a return to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Nicaragua is essential, and we will use the diplomatic and economic tools available to promote accountability for the Ortega-Murillo regime, to reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners, and to urge the restoration of civic space for the people of Nicaragua.\n\nOne more item before we take your questions. Last week, Russian authorities initiated a new criminal case against opposition leader and anticorruption campaigner Aleksey Navalny for allegedly, quote, \"propagating extremism, calling for terrorism, financing extremist activity, and rehabilitating Nazism.\" Those, of course, were their charges. These charges could result in a cumulative 30 years imprisonment. Only two days before the outrageous new charges were issued, an appeals court in Moscow rejected Mr. Navalnys latest appeal, and today marks 644 days since Mr. Navalny was unjustly imprisoned.\n\nThe United States is deeply concerned by the Kremlins escalation of its harassment of Mr. Navalny and continued disregard for human rights. The Russian Governments ludicrous, cynical references to Nazism fool no one outside of the echo chamber of lies it has imposed on the population of Russia through its censorship and disinformation. The United States condemns Russias continued contempt for democratic principles as demonstrated by the unjust harassment, prosecution, and imprisonment of Russian citizens who seek to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms. We once again join Mr. Navalnys family, his colleagues, and his supporters around the world in calling for his immediate and unconditional release.\n\nWith that, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. Echo chamber is an interesting expression to use as it relates to Russia.\n\nIll be really brief because I was late and I apologize. Just in terms of the comments that weve been hearing from Russian officials and the response to those comments from you guys, from the French, from the Brits and I notice that there was a call today, another one, between the Gerasimov and the British chief of staff, I guess is what you would call it, basically outlining the same things, that they think that the Ukrainians are going to or they accuse the Ukrainians of plotting to use a dirty bomb and that they will respond in kind. So without getting into what happened over the weekend and what has already been said, is there anything new that you guys have to say on this topic today?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, you asked that we not get into the weekend, but I think the weekend is important context for what were speaking to, because over the weekend you did hear and you saw a number of calls take place not only from senior officials here in Washington but from capitals in Europe. And you saw a remarkably consistent message in those readouts of those calls as well as in the joint statement that we put out last night with the forbearance of our French and British partners, who were working late early into this morning, I should say to finalize it, that made clear that were concerned when we hear this type of patently false disinformation emanating from the Kremlin. We know the Kremlins track record when it comes to these types of claims. Thats what of course what is the predicate, what ultimately undergirds our concern. We reject the transparently false allegation that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. That was a message you saw in the readouts, in the joint statement that we issued yesterday.\n\nAnd then just today, you saw from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba he put out a statement about his call with Director General Grossi of the IAEA, and Foreign Minister Kuleba said in that statement that he invited the IAEA to, quote, \"urgently send experts to peaceful facilities in Ukraine which Russia deceitfully claims to be developing a dirty bomb.\" And the IAEA has agreed. Secretary Blinken will be meeting later today with Director General Grossi of the IAEA. I imagine this will be a topic of discussion.\n\nThe broader point and again, you heard this not only from us but from our European allies as well is that the world would see through any Russian attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation. We wanted to be very clear in our calls, in our joint statements, in the readouts of those calls today, and some of which have started yesterday and that have continued today we wanted to send a very clear message that any such effort would be transparent, any such effort would not fool the world.\n\nQUESTION: Well, it wouldnt be transparent. You would see through it.\n\nMR PRICE: Correct.\n\nQUESTION: Thats the transparency.\n\nMR PRICE: Correct, correct.\n\nQUESTION: But youre not accusing the Russians of being transparent, or are you?\n\nMR PRICE: We are\n\nQUESTION: Are you saying that they are that they are telling you exactly\n\nMR PRICE: Any such deceitful attempt would be transparent transparent in its deceitfulness, I suppose. Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. And so how exactly would you respond?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, Im not going to weigh in on a hypothetical. We wanted to make very clear that any Russian attempt to establish a pretext for escalation would be nothing more than a deceitful pretext. We wanted to lay that predicate very clearly at the earliest concerning statements that we heard from senior Russian officials.\n\nHumeyra.\n\nQUESTION: Just to follow up on all of that, what evidence do you have at this moment that they might indeed be preparing for this pretext? Are you picking up any signs, any intel that they are preparing to use this as a pretext and escalate themselves?\n\nMR PRICE: Well\n\nQUESTION: With a dirty bomb or with a nuclear\n\nMR PRICE: We unfortunately are all too familiar the world is all too familiar with the Kremlins track record. This is a point that we made prior to February 24th. Its a point weve made consistently since then. And there is a track record to back that up. Obviously, in this case, we are concerned that this false allegation could be used as a pretext for further Russian escalation. And weve made that concern very clear. Weve made very clear that we reject any potential and we would reject any potential Russian effort to use a pretext to escalate this conflict. At this time, though, we havent seen any we have seen not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture, nor do we have indications that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons. But weve heard these very concerning statements, and we wanted to send a very clear signal.\n\nQUESTION: And I just wanted to ask Matts question again, because I think I dont think that its a hypothetical because youre just saying that there is elevated concern. So Jake Sullivan a few weeks ago have talked about without going into detail the kind of response that Russia would get if they if it were to deploy nuclear weapons. Would you be treating a dirty bomb attack in the same way? Would it be different? Have you communicated to allies what response you would be giving if that were the case?\n\nMR PRICE: Weve been very clear with the Russians. Weve been very clear with the world publicly with the world, privately with the Russians about the severe consequences that would result from nuclear use. Again, to Matts question, Im not going to weigh in on every conceivable hypothetical. It would certainly be another example of President Putins brutality if he were to use a so-called dirty bomb. There would be consequences for Russia whether it uses a dirty bomb or a nuclear bomb. Weve been very clear about that.\n\nQUESTION: Can I just ask you one other thing? Do you read anything into it that it has been Russian defense officials reaching out to defense counterparts, rather than the\n\nMR PRICE: We\n\nQUESTION: foreign minister, rather than diplomats? Does that mean anything to you at all?\n\nMR PRICE: Look, its not helpful, I think, for us to try to read the tea leaves.\n\nQUESTION: Im not asking you read the tea leaves.\n\nMR PRICE: Certainly not certainly not publicly. Whenever we see a leaf that is suggestive of a potential Russian pretext for further escalation, thats something of concern with concern to us, and we sought to be very clear and on the record about that concern.\n\nSaid.\n\nQUESTION: Do you have a what is a dirty bomb? Do you have a definition to a dirty bomb? Something that uses uranium, for instance? Is that it? Like depleted uranium or\n\nMR PRICE: Whether I couldnt say whether theres a technical definition.\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nMR PRICE: I think the definition that most people use is a crude radiological device.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, just so I understand correctly, youre saying that the only evidence is the fact that the Russian chief of staff, I believe, spoke with his counterpart and warned against the possible use of such a bomb by Ukraine, right? There is no other evidence?\n\nMR PRICE: Our concern is predicated on the very worrisome statements that weve heard from the Russians. And Said, it is based on those statements. But unfortunately, we have seen a pattern in this conflict, in this war, in the lead-up to this war, where the Russians have engaged in mirror-imaging. The Russians have accused the Ukrainians, the Russians have accused other countries, of what it itself was planning. That is our concern.\n\nNow, we also want to be clear about what we havent seen. We havent seen any reason for us to change our nuclear posture. We havent seen any indications that the Russians are preparing to deploy a nuclear weapon. Of course, weve heard worrisome rhetoric, troubling rhetoric from President Putin, from other senior Russian officials that pre-date these most recent statements. Its why were watching very closely and why we will adjust our posture if and when we need to.\n\nAlex.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, Ned, thanks so much. Back to Matts question on the defense line, the communication line. Its important I dont want to let this slide because today marks eight months of into this war. When the Secretary decided to call his colleague a couple of months ago, he came down here to make sure first we are aware in advance, and secondly, there is nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. What happened in the administrations policy? Why is it okay now to pick up a phone call from Shoigu, who is personally responsible for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians lives? And secondly, what happened to the administrations \"nothing without Ukraine about Ukraine\" policy?\n\nMR PRICE: That is still very much our mantra. That is still very much our policy. I think its important, Alex, to note that the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense have different responsibilities; they have different mandates. When the Secretary picked up the phone to speak with Foreign Minister Lavrov several months ago now, he did so because there were several important bilateral concerns that he thought it important to relay through his channel, which is foreign policy, which is a policy channel. In the first instance, it was our efforts to see the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner. He also was very clear about the consequences that would befall Moscow that weve now seen implemented against Moscow were it to move forward with, at the time, was the threat of annexation by force.\n\nOf course, Secretary Austin has a different set of responsibilities. I will let the Pentagon speak to his calls. They have issued a public readout. But when Secretary Austin picks up the phone to speak to secretary to Minister of Defense Shoigu, as he has done on a couple of occasions now, there are a different set of topics than Secretary Blinken would discuss with Foreign Minister Lavrov.\n\nI can assure you again, without speaking purporting to speak for Secretary Austin or the Pentagon that Secretary Austin would not engage in anything about Ukraine without Ukraine. That is a mantra that is at the heart of our approach both in this building, at the Pentagon, from the White House, and throughout this administration.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. Two questions on sanctions in Georgia. Is the U.S. State Department aware of the new list of sanctions that was assigned by Zelenskyy last week targeting the inner circle, business circle, and family members of the Georgian oligarch who, I remind you, has been controlling, orchestrating Georgian politics for the last 10 years? Have you had any consultation with Ukrainians like broadly on sanctions and lists or on concrete names on those lists?\n\nMR PRICE: We have a close working relationship with our Ukrainian partners. I would need to defer to them to speak to any sanctions that they may have issued. When it comes to Georgia youve heard us say this on a number of occasions; I think I have made this point to you previously that we remain committed to working with Georgias Government as it undertakes the reforms that have been called for by the European Union, by the European Commission in this case. We want to work with Georgia on its path and on its broader European aspirations.\n\nQUESTION: And a second question. So generally speaking, considering millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars pouring into helping Georgia become this robust, strong democracy over the last 30-plus years of the diplomatic relations, how concerned are you about the apparent drift of Georgia to towards the Russian orbit? When you look at the attacks of the U.S. ambassador in Georgia by the MPs this is something you had a statement on, I believe, in August and you had to defend your ambassador from the podium, which is unprecedented for the 30 years of diplomatic relations between two countries; and when you look at the MPs of the ruling parties who are talking about the plot by the U.S. targeting Georgia, and U.S. is trying Georgia to drag into a new war with Russia so how concerned are you when you see those events and statements by different members of the ruling party over the time?\n\nMR PRICE: Weve voiced our concern about some of the troubling statements that we have heard emanate from some corners of Georgias political system and Georgian society. Weve voiced our concern about some of the governments actions. The governments actions, including stalling or moving backward on important democratic reforms, have created setbacks. They have created setbacks to the clear, overwhelming aspirations of the people of Georgia for EU membership and for broader EU Euro-Atlantic aspiration. These actions were concerned because they have also deepened polarization within Georgian society rather than unify the country around the core issues of Euro-Atlantic integration. There has been a degree of polarization which is not helpful for the country. It is not helpful for Georgias broader political aspiration.\n\nHaving said all that, we remain committed to working with Georgia to make the reforms needed to meet its Euro-Atlantic goals. We urge Georgia to demonstrate its commitment to EU integration by adopting reforms necessary to move forward on that path.\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nQUESTION: Do you think that the situation in Georgia undermines Georgias American interest in Georgia, especially in light of this event and the war that broke out in February?\n\nMR PRICE: I missed the first part of your question.\n\nQUESTION: Do you think that the situation in Georgia and this concerns that, for instance, the former ambassadors of the U.S. to Georgia have I speak with them on a regular basis do you think the current situation in Georgia politically undermines the U.S. interest in the region? And Im talking Im asking this question in light of the war in the region.\n\nMR PRICE: Well, we think some of the actions, some of the rhetoric, has worked against the interests of the Georgian people. Thats what we care most about when it comes to Georgia and its chosen path, its chosen path of greater Euro-Atlantic integration and its EU aspirations. We want to see Georgia advance along that path. We stand ready to continue to be a partner to the Georgian people, to Georgian society, to the Georgian Government as they seek to do so.\n\nShaun.\n\nQUESTION: Can I ask you something else on Ukraine?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: President Zelenskyy today spoke at a conference virtually of Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper. And he spoke about the what he terms a Russian-Iranian alliance, and saying that Israel should do more, including supply of defensive weapons of the Iron Dome. Does the United States have anything to say about that? Does it want to weigh in on whether Israel could be doing more to help Ukraine right now?\n\nMR PRICE: Shaun, as a general matter, we dont weigh in specifically on what countries could be doing or are doing. We offer our gratitude and our appreciation for the dozens of countries around the world that are providing support to the Ukrainian people. Some of those countries are providing security assistance. Some of those countries are providing economic assistance. Some of those countries are providing humanitarian assistance. Some of those countries are providing all three, like the United States.\n\nWhen we were last in Israel in March, the Israeli our Israeli counterparts took the Secretary to the command center and they showed us a very impressive presentation of a functioning Israeli field hospital that, as I recall, had just been constructed. Israel has provided important humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine. Israel has consistently signaled that it stands on the side of the Ukrainian people and the side of the broader rules-based international order that Russia is seeking to undermine and to contravene.\n\nSo we would refer to our Israeli partners to speak specifically to the type of support they are providing, to the type of support they may consider providing.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. State Department official Gabriel Escobar had discussions in Belgrade and Pristina last week, but no results yet. Then Miroslav Lajk over the weekend continued on behalf of the EU to work on the car license plates and energy issues. My question: What are Secretary Blinkens expectations for this week? And is and what is his message to Pristina and Belgrade, given that October 31st deadline is fast approaching for the license plates?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, our message on this has been consistent. We fully support the EU-facilitated dialogue. Thats why DAS Escobar, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Gabe Escobar, was in Pristina and Belgrade to support this process. As you know, the Secretary himself has also been deeply engaged on this. He spoke with both Serbian President Vui and Kosovan Prime Minister Kurti earlier this month, on October 11th, I believe it was. He underscored our support for the EU-facilitated Kosovo-Serbia dialogue. He urged continued constructive engagement to secure peace and stability across the region.\n\nWe will continue to support that EU dialogue. We will continue to be a partner both to Kosovo and Serbia in the hope that they can resolve this dispute peacefully in the course of the coming days.\n\nSaid.\n\nQUESTION: Can I switch topics?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. On the Palestinian-Israeli issue. Ned, four days ago the Israelis began implementing a law that restricts entry into the West Bank, and I know youve been talking to the Israelis on this issue. And I want to ask you: How far along have you gotten with them? What kind of promises have the Israelis been able to give you on this issue?\n\nMR PRICE: We continue to have discussions with our Israeli counterparts on this. When weve had concerns, we voice those concerns very clearly to our Israeli counterparts. Youve heard us voice some of those concerns publicly as well. So its something we continue to discuss.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah. But in the meantime, if, lets say, someone like me wants to go, they would have to request a visa 45 days in advance and so on. Is that is that okay with you?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, Said, when weve had concerns, weve been transparent about those concerns.\n\nQUESTION: But\n\nMR PRICE: This dialogue, this is a conversation that is continuing. Obviously, Israel has important security concerns. There are also important humanitarian considerations at play here. We want to make sure that the balance of all of those interests and all of those factors is appropriate.\n\nQUESTION: But Israel does not do this to other Americans. It uses imposes this law on Palestinian Americans. So there is quite a distinction. They do have security concerns, but are you just expressing your that you are annoyed with this law, or are you are you\n\nMR PRICE: This has been a this has been\n\nQUESTION: willing to take any measures to ensure that people who carry American passport and American citizenship are treated equally?\n\nMR PRICE: This has been a longstanding conversation, and this has been going on for some time prior to the implementation of this as these rules have evolved in recent months, and even in recent days. So well continue to have this conversation when it comes to the ability of American citizens to travel, but also as it pertains to the security, the humanitarian considerations that are also at play.\n\nQUESTION: So is it likely that the Israelis might reverse this policy?\n\nMR PRICE: I wouldnt want to speak for the Israelis.\n\nYes, Alex.\n\nQUESTION: These are both Iran-related questions, two questions. Iranian drones actually, drone instructors have been spotted in Belarus over the weekend. Do you have any comment on that?\n\nAnd secondly, Iran also announced on Sunday that it can supply Russia with 40 turbines to help it with gas industry. As you know, the Russian gas industry is facing Western sanctions, so Iran is trying to help Russia out on that as well. Any comment on it?\n\nMR PRICE: When it comes to your first question, were aware of reports but we are not in a position to comment on them, that there are these Iranian trainers in Belarus. Weve noted more broadly our great concern about Iranian presence in Russian-occupied Ukraine in Crimea in particular and its actions with Russia in this regard, and were following these reports very closely.\n\nAs weve said, were continually working to ensure that the Russian Federation and the Lukashenka regime in Belarus pay a severe price, an economic toll, for Russias aggression against Ukraine. With our allies and partners, we have taken actions that target the financial networks and the assets of the Kremlins, as well as those belonging to the Lukashenka regime for enabling this Russian posture.\n\nThe Lukashenka regime, well before Russias war against Ukraine started, made a decision to cede the sovereignty of Belarus which should be, which is, a sovereign country to cede its sovereign rights to Russia to allow Russian forces to stage in Belarus, to mount a multifront attack against Ukraine. In doing so, the Lukashenka regime again put its own interests ahead of those of the people of Belarus. This has been a consistent pattern of behavior on the part of the Lukashenka regime, and we have taken action, together with allies and partners, to see to it that the regime pays a price.\n\nQUESTION: On turbine question, please?\n\nMR PRICE: Sorry. What was the turbine question?\n\nQUESTION: Turbines. Well, Iran is on Sunday announced its going to help Russian gas sector with 40 turbines. As you know, it is subject to Western sanctions.\n\nMR PRICE: Our sanctions remain fully in effect, fully in force. We will take action as appropriate if we see sanctionable activity, whether thats on the part of Iran, whether thats on the part of Russia.\n\nQUESTION: One more Iranian, if I may. Iranian Revolutionary Guard held military exercises on border with Azerbaijan last week, which triggered some concerns in Azerbaijan. Any comment on that, please?\n\nMR PRICE: I dont have a particular comment on that. Of course we want to see and weve we have made clear our interest in seeing a stable Caucasus region, a region that where we work both with Armenia and Azerbaijan to de-escalate tensions between those two countries and to work to de-escalate any broader tensions that may arise.\n\nGuita.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. Special Envoy Rob Malleys tweet over the weekend has angered Iranian activists about the it was about the demonstrations, where he said that the demonstrators want their government to respect their dignity and human rights.\n\nWhen the State Department looks at these videos out of Iran as well as those demonstrations held across the world, what do you see these people asking for? Because, okay, it all started yes, we want more freedom but then it has evolved. It has changed into chants of \"Death to dictator, death to the Islamic Republic.\" Theyre asking for regime change. What does the State Department see in these videos?\n\nMR PRICE: Its not for us to interpret what the people of Iran are asking for. It is up to them to be very clear with their voice, with their own government and with the world, to state what they are asking for.\n\nIt is up to us and what we have done is to provide the Iranian people with some of the tools that can help their voice be heard. The Iranian people by peacefully taking to the streets, by making these demands, we have sought to lend them and to certainly not stand in the way of services, the provision of hardware, of software that will allow their voices to be heard both within Iran, between Iranian citizens inside Iran, and to allow their voices to be heard outside of Iran. It is important that the world listen to the people of Iran.\n\nWe would never intend to characterize what it is that they seek. That is for the Iranian people to define and to express themselves.\n\nQUESTION: Well, they are saying that they want regime change, they dont want the Islamic Republic anymore. But just the fact that the tweet says, \"their government.\" They dont consider the Islamic Republic their government.\n\nMR PRICE: And Rob has spoken to this. He would never intend to speak for or on behalf of the people of Iran. It is up to the Iranian people to be clear about their aspirations, and we are hearing those aspirations every day. We want to continue, we will continue to do everything we can to see to it that their voices are heard both inside Iran and well beyond as well. After all, they are expressing and exercising rights that are as universal to them as they are to anyone else.\n\nRob Malley is a tremendous public servant. He is someone who has led our approach to this set of challenges. He is someone who has been at the forefront as we have developed new tools like General License D-2 that we announced last month. He has been at the forefront as we have developed accountability measures to impose on senior Iranian officials and entities, including the so-called \"morality police;\" including on those who are responsible for the bloodshed, for the repression; including on those who have sought to silence the voices of the Iranian people. We are going to continue to look for what to examine what more we can do to support the Iranian people as they seek to have their voices heard and respected.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, I think the point is, though, that you dont have to interpret what theyre saying. What is it that you see that theyre calling for? Do you think that theyre calling for something thats less than regime change?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, I am not going to speak on behalf of the Iranian people. They are doing that they are doing that\n\nQUESTION: Well, you have a senior official who did just that over the weekend.\n\nMR PRICE: They are doing that very ably, and its our charge to provide them with the tools, to see to it that the tools that can help lift those voices; to see to it that the world can hear their voices, that those tools can reach them.\n\nQUESTION: Well, what do you think that theyre protesting what do you think theyre protesting about?\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, there often are proximate causes when it comes to protests. I think it is clear that the proximate cause over the course of the past year has been any number of things: water shortages, mismanagement, the death of Mahsa Amini. And since then, of course, weve seen these protests take on a much larger scale and in some ways a much broader meaning and significance. But its not for me to either interpret or to speak on behalf of the people of Iran. It is our charge to see to it that they can speak on behalf of themselves, to see to it that the rest of the world can hear the important messages that they have to say.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, what is it the message what is the message that you hear from these protests, then?\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, I am the spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State. I am not the spokesperson for protesters in Iran. So we will leave it to them to voice their aspirations.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, lets say that if I walk down the street carrying a sign saying oranges are bad, okay orange, the fruit oranges are bad; they should be banned what would you say that my message is?\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, I would say Im the\n\nQUESTION: Is that up for you to interpret?\n\nMR PRICE: Im the spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State. I am not the spokesperson for oranges.\n\nYes, go ahead. (Laughter.) Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Jahanzaib Ali from ARY News TV, Pakistan. Senior Pakistani journalist, and my colleague, my friend, Arshad Sharif was killed in Nairobi. I think can I just .\n\nQUESTION: Sorry.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. No, its all right. So a senior journalist, my colleague, my friend, Arshad Sharif was killed in Nairobi, and he was forced to live in exile due to his investigative reporting about the specific political system of Pakistan. Sir, we often talk about this. What is your message to the Pakistani leadership to fulfill their commitments regarding press freedom?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, first, I express my condolences to you. I express my condolences to Arshads colleagues, to his loved ones, to family members, to all those who knew him, who knew his work. Were deeply saddened by the death of Arshad Sharif. We encourage a full investigation by the Government of Kenya into his death. Its not entirely clear that we know all the circumstances at this point regarding what led to his death, but we do urge a full investigation.\n\nQUESTION: Sir, Arshad Sharif called me the day before yesterday. I was talking to him on the phone, and he told me that he applied to renew his U.S. visa from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, but it was rejected. So, sir, is there any kind of special kind of thing that you like have those kind of journalists or people who just, like, facing death threats and apply for the visa? I mean, just came into my mind, this question. I was talking to him the day before yesterday, and I was trying to help him.\n\nMR PRICE: Its difficult for me to speak with any specificity regarding what we could do with a particular individual, but we have programs around the world in the first instance to bolster protections for those who are exercising what is another universal right, the right to freedom of expression, the right to information. And its clear through his work that Arshad Sharif was dedicated to that fundamental right of freedom of expression took him around the world. His work was known around the world.\n\nUSAID has a number of programs to work with governments around the world to bolster those rights, to bolster independent media. We have taken action. The department and others have taken action when we are aware of efforts on the part of governments around the world to intimidate, to harass, to otherwise seek to silence the voices of those who are so committed to that freedom of expression.\n\nQUESTION: Sir, there are many Pakistani journalists who are living in exile due to this kind of threats. To be honest, I feel 100 percent safe here in Washington, D.C., but just wanted to hear from you the journalists who are a little critical about Pakistani political system, should we should they all feel safe here in United States of America?\n\nMR PRICE: This is a country that cherishes the rights that are enshrined in our Constitution, in our Bill of Rights. I, of course, am not here to offer advice to everyone, but these are rights that are embedded in our countrys experience, that are embedded in Americas DNA. We also believe that these rights are universal. These are rights that should not be only protected here. These are rights that should be at the heart of societies around the world. And when countries fail to respect these rights, when they actively try to contravene these rights in this case, when they attempt to suppress, repress, or otherwise harass journalists they tend to hear about it from the United States. And thats a good thing.\n\nYeah.\n\nQUESTION: Just may I ask one more on Pakistan, since were on the topic?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Does the United States have anything to say about the decision to bar Imran Khan from standing for election for five years?\n\nMR PRICE: We are not going to inject ourselves into internal Pakistani politics or into a dispute between the court and the Pakistani political system.\n\nYes. Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Can I ask something completely different?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: If you dont Haiti. Just wanted I know youve addressed this in recent days and the Secretary addressed it on Friday, but or the French foreign minister. With the can you say where things stand now on having an international force for Haiti? Is there a partner country? Does the United States still find this to be an urgent priority?\n\nMR PRICE: We do still find it to be an urgent priority. We, along with Haitian leaders, along with OAS leadership, along with many of our partners and allies around the world, do see the status quo as unsustainable given the security situation, the public health situation, the economic situation that Haitians are confronting. We believe the Haitian people must find a way to achieve an inclusive, broad-based, consistent broad-based consensus on the way forward for their countrys government and development, and, of course, there have been discrete actors who have sought to stand in the way. We strongly condemn acts of violence that occurred in Haiti over the past weeks and those malign actors who continue to block the distribution of food and fuel to Haitian businesses and other essential Haitian institutions.\n\nWe are encouraging actions that will lead to the conditions for elections to take place as soon as possible. As you know, just last week, on October 21st, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted the sanctions resolution that we put forth together with our Mexican partners to hold some of these malign actors accountable, and by taking this step, weve taken we have helped to stymie the activities of criminal actors in Haiti. And after robust and inclusive negotiations, this resolution is truly reflective of the council consensus.\n\nAs you know, were continuing to work with our partners to determine the next steps. We have in the meantime provided Haitian officials with vital security-related equipment. We did so earlier this month on October 15th, when the United States and Canada together provided security-related equipment to Port-au-Prince flown in by military aircraft. This equipment was purchased by the Haitian Government for their fight against criminal gangs.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned.\n\nQUESTION: Ned.\n\nMR PRICE: Ill come back to you.\n\nHumeyra.\n\nQUESTION: Just on Brittney Griner, because she has her appeal hearing tomorrow. So I think its been about three months since U.S. has put forward the substantial proposal. There hasnt been any developments. Can you give us an update where those talks are? Is there any reason to be hopeful?\n\nMR PRICE: The only element I can offer in terms of an update is that these discussions have been ongoing. You are correct that we put forward a substantial proposal a number of months ago now. We have consistently urged our Russian counterparts to act on this proposal. The fact that Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan remain in detention, the fact that Brittney Griner last week celebrated her 32nd birthday in detention, the fact that Paul Whelan has spent years in detention is a sign that these discussions have not gotten the point gotten to the point where we would like them to be, because we would like to see Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner home. We would like to see them reunited with their families.\n\nQUESTION: And when you see that the when you say the discussions are still ongoing, do you mean there are active discussions when you guys are basically negotiating on what kind of a deal can be formulated, or just that the communication channel is open but its just basically not moving?\n\nMR PRICE: I can say there have been active discussions, including in recent days, but our imperative is to see Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner returned home. We are not going to do anything, to say anything publicly that could impair that ability. These conversations we know from past experience, including in the case of Trevor Reed, are best conducted privately in the appropriate channels.\n\nYes. A follow-up? Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: Brittney Griners lawyer said today that shes hoping that they reduce her nineyear prison sentence tomorrow as part of the appeal conclusion. Is that also what the U.S. Government is hoping for, or what are you hoping to see tomorrow?\n\nMR PRICE: What were hoping to see and what we are working to see is the return of Brittney Griner to her loving wife, the return of Paul Whelan to his loving family. That is what we are working to achieve.\n\nWe have not weighed in on the various judicial proceedings and judicial steps because, as weve made clear, we believe that these proceedings have been largely shambolic. This has been an effort to detain wrongfully an American citizen two American citizens in the case of Paul Whelan, of Brittney Griner. Wrongful detainees are by definition wrongfully held. They are used for as political pawns, as leverage. It is our goal to see them home as soon as we can.\n\nQUESTION: And can I just one question on Russia really quickly? Theres a group of I think 30 liberal Democrats who wrote a letter to Biden today, and they are citing the need for a proactive diplomatic push and redoubling efforts to create a framework for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Is the Biden administration doing that, or will you do that?\n\nMR PRICE: Nobody wants to see this war ended more than our Ukrainian partners. Our Ukrainian partners have similarly said that this war will only end through diplomacy and dialogue. We know what that end game will entail; we dont know when it will transpire. And we dont know when it will transpire principally and solely because we have not seen any indication from the Russians that they are prepared to engage in that diplomacy and dialogue. If and when that happens and just as our Ukrainian partners are convinced it will happen, we are convinced it will happen we will be standing by the side of Ukraine; we will be supporting their diplomatic efforts.\n\nBut in the first instance, this is going to be diplomacy that our Ukrainian partners are going to have to lead. They are going to have to determine the contours of this diplomacy, what any negotiation will look like. In the interim, of course, we havent been sitting on our hands. We have been providing our Ukrainian partners with what they need on the battlefield so that when the negotiating table emerges, they will be in the strongest possible position. That is the most important thing we can do now: to provide them with support to strengthen their hand on the battlefield, ultimately to make their hand stronger at the negotiating table, as we continue to impose costs and consequences on the Russians.\n\nQUESTION: So you would\n\nQUESTION: May I follow on Ukraine?\n\nQUESTION: So you would say that the Biden administration is proactively pushing for diplomacy, or that you guys are holding off on that proactive push because you dont think itll be effective?\n\nMR PRICE: In order for diplomacy to take place, there have to be parties ready and willing to engage in diplomacy. Right now, we have heard from our Ukrainian partners repeatedly that this war will only end through diplomacy and dialogue. We have not heard any reciprocal statement or refrain from Moscow that they are ready in good faith to engage in that diplomacy and dialogue.\n\nYes, sir. Ive yes.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Thank you, Ned, for giving me the chance. My name is Mesfin from TG Ethiopia, and my question is about Ethiopia. Heres my first question, then. Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians gathered Saturday in Addis Ababa and other cities in Ethiopia to demand that the United States and other European countries stop their interference and pressure in Ethiopias internal affairs. Some demonstrators even displayed banners accusing the United States of disrespecting Ethiopias sovereignty. What is the State Departments response to the demonstrators demands?\n\nMR PRICE: Im sorry, I missed the first part of your question in terms of the demonstrators demands.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, they are accusing the United States disrespecting Ethiopias sovereignty. They are saying that the United States is interfering in Ethiopias internal affairs. So what is your response to that?\n\nMR PRICE: Our response, of course, is that those claims are wholly inaccurate, they are wholly wrong. The interest of the United States is the interest of the Ethiopian people: to see the restoration of peace, to see an end to the violence, to see a sovereign, whole Ethiopia. And thats why weve supported the African Union-led talks.\n\nAnd tomorrow in fact, these African Union-led talks will kick off in South Africa to address the ongoing conflict in northern Ethiopia that has cost so many lives, has led to atrocities, has led to bloodshed, has led to starvation, has aggravated so many underlying factors. We commend South Africa for hosting the talks. We stand ready to support the African Union High Representative Obasanjo and the AU panel members, former South African Deputy Prime Minister[1] Mlambo-Ngcuka, and former Kenyan President Kenyatta in facilitating an agreement.\n\nAnd to that end, our Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Mike Hammer is in South Africa to observe and to participate in the AU-led talks along with United Nations and IGAD, and to support efforts to have an immediate cessation of hostilities, to deliver humanitarian assistance to all Ethiopians in need, to prevent further human rights abuses and atrocity atrocities, and to secure Eritreas withdrawal from northern Ethiopia. Those are our interests, but importantly, those are also the interests of the Ethiopian people.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, yesterday also Ethiopians and Eritreans demonstrated in front of the White House asking the same question. Did you get their messages?\n\nMR PRICE: We have heard loud and clear messages from Ethiopians around the world, first in the first instance, in Ethiopia. Our special envoy has spent significant time in Addis in recent weeks meeting with a range of stakeholders. Of course there are vibrant Ethiopian diaspora communities around the world, including here in the United States. Were engaging with appropriate stakeholders to determine how best we can help the people of Ethiopia achieve their aspirations to end the violence, to provide humanitarian assistance, to restore Ethiopias sovereignty, and to put an end to the atrocities and human rights abuses.\n\nQUESTION: And final question, Ned.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, can we move to China?\n\nQUESTION: Final question.\n\nMR PRICE: Final question.\n\nQUESTION: The Ethiopian military is advancing in Tigray regions and today also announced that the Ethiopian military occupied some of the Tigrayans capital. What is your thought on this?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, weve been clear since the resumption of fighting: the fighting must stop. Peace must be given a chance through these talks, these talks that are set to begin tomorrow in South Africa. We call on the Government of Ethiopia and Tigrayan authorities to engage seriously in these talks to achieve an immediate cessation of hostilities, the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all Ethiopians in need, to prevent further human rights abuses and atrocities, and to effect Eritreas withdrawal from northern Ethiopia.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, Ned. On China, do you have does the U.S. have a has an assessment on the outcome of Chinas 20th Party Congress, and does the outcome in any way, shape, or form change the U.S. calculation in dealing with the Peoples Republic of China (inaudible) and if you could share with us any U.S. intelligence on the former President Hu Jintao being escorted out, apparently non-voluntarily? Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Of course the conclusion of the party conference doesnt change our approach. Youve heard our approach articulated most clearly and most at length by Secretary Blinken in May when he outlined our approach to the PRC. We do note the conclusion of the 20th Party Congress and we would welcome cooperation of the PRC where our interests align, and that includes cooperation on climate change, on global health, counternarcotics, nonproliferation as well.\n\nAt the same time, the administration has been clear that were focused on responsibly managing the competition with the PRC. This is perhaps the most consequential bilateral relationship we have. Well continue our efforts to keep lines of communication open, including at the leader level. We think it is incumbent on the United States to do that. Its why Secretary Blinken has not hesitated to meet with Wang Yi, others have not hesitated to meet with, to speak with, their PRC counterparts, and well continue to keep those lines of communication open.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Any take on the Hu Jintao being escorted out? Will you be able to\n\nMR PRICE: I dont have any comment or assessment to offer.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: And you mentioned that the Secretary in May the speech in May. Do you have anything on the status of China House? Is it up and running or is there a timeline?\n\nMR PRICE: This is something that were continuing to discuss with members of Congress. We know that our approach to the PRC will be most effective when we have buy-in from congressional overseers, congressional appropriators, congressional authorizers. These are conversations that are ongoing, but we look forward to launching China House at the first possible opportunity, knowing that if we are to compete effectively against or with the PRC we need to be able to pull on all of the resources that are within and under this roof. And that is the point of China House, to integrate the resources that we have here at the State Department and to ensure that in turn we can integrate them with what the White House is doing, what our partners in the interagency are doing as well.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: You and colleagues have described this as a period of provocation with North Koreas activity and tensions between the North and the South. Now that the PRCs national congress is over and were a few days ahead of the U.S. midterms, is there any reason to be more concerned now about North Korea trying anything with a nuclear test than before this current period?\n\nMR PRICE: Our concern regarding the potential for another North Korean nuclear test, which would be its seventh, has been consistent for some time now. We assess that the DPRK is preparing its Punggye-ri test site for what would be its seventh test. This is consistent with the DPRKs own public statements. This is something weve said for a number of months now.\n\nWe are preparing for all contingencies in close coordination with our partners and allies around the world. As you know, Deputy Secretary Sherman is in Japan. Much of her visit in Japan will be dedicated to discussing the challenge that the DPRK poses to the region. Shell do that bilaterally with her Japanese and South Korean counterparts. Shell also do it trilaterally, recognizing the importance of trilateral cooperation on this challenge.\n\nWere prepared to make both short and longer-term adjustments to our military posture as appropriate in responding to DPRK provocation and, as necessary, to strengthen both defense and deterrence to protect our allies in the region.\n\nWe have made consistently clear that we harbor no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We remain open to dialogue. We remain open to diplomacy. We recognize that diplomacy and dialogue remains the most effective path by which to achieve our overarching goal, and thats the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. At the same time, our commitment to the security of our personnel in the region, of our treaty allies, is ironclad, it is sacrosanct, and well discuss that in forthcoming engagements.\n\nYes. Janne.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. You know that the North Korea invaded Northern Limit Line, NLL, early this morning. Also, regarding former National Security Advisor Bolton recently said that United States cannot give up North Korea to nuclear weapons through diplomacy and sanctions; therefore, as another option, he said that the North Koreans regime should be changed. What is the Biden administration doing to change the North Korean Kim Jong-uns regime? Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Those are the words of private citizen; they should be treated as such. We have made very clear that the policy of this administration that, by the way, has been similar to the policies of previous administrations is that diplomacy and dialogue represents the most effective means by which to address the challenge that North Korea poses. That is why we remain, as I just said a moment ago, open to dialogue and diplomacy. We harbor no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We seek to have practical conversations on fulfilling what is that core and overarching goal: the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: One more quick one. North Korea mocks South Korea for being rejected by the United States to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea. How you can analyze this?\n\nMR PRICE: Our commitment to the security of our allies, including the ROK, including Japan is ironclad. That commitment is sacrosanct. As you know, we recently resumed the extended deterrence working group. We are committed to extended deterrence for our allies Japan and South Korea.\n\nQUESTION: Ned\n\nMR PRICE: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: So you took issue with Tahrir al-Sham being in control of Afrin in Syria. Now theyre supposedly withdrawn from the city, but some reports indicate including some reports from conflict monetary organizations and claim that they havent really withdrawn from the city. Its just theyve switched their flags from their flag to some other groups. Whats your current understanding of the Tahrir al-Shams control of Afrin?\n\nMR PRICE: Im not in a position to offer a more updated assessment beyond what weve said (inaudible). Its something we monitor very closely, but I just dont have an updated assessment to offer today.\n\nQUESTION: Apart from just calling for them to leave the city, did you have any other tools to get them out of the city?\n\nMR PRICE: This is something that weve been focused on with partners in the region. Of course, instability in Syria, the ability of extremist groups, of terrorist groups to use Syrian territory to form a base, to plot, that is of concern to all of us. We have a range of tools and well continue to calibrate those tools appropriately.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Oh, thank you, Ned. One short clarification on Ukraine. Could you clarify the administration position about the possibility of the American troops being physically being present at or settled on the Ukrainian territory? Why I got this question? This Saturday CBS News made a reportage from Romania, and they spoke with the leadership of the U.S. Army 101 Airborne, and American military told them that Im quoting they are fully prepared to cross the border into Ukraine. And I got my audience in Ukraine and people are curious: is it any shift in a new U.S. administration position, or may one consider this as a signal to Moscow?\n\nMR PRICE: There has been no shift in the administrations position. Our position has been clear. Were going to do everything we can to stand with Ukraine, to stand for the rules-based international order that Russia is attempting to undermine and to contravene. We are doing that through the provision of security assistance. We are doing that by holding the Kremlin and its key decision leaders to account with sanctions, other economic and financial measures. But the President has been clear we are not going to get into certainly not going to seek to get into a war with Russia. What we are doing is providing Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against what is clearly Russian aggression.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. The Mexican Government has confirmed it has purchased several units of scanning equipment from a company with strong links to the Chinese government. We learned from Washington Post reporting this weekend that the Biden administration considered this purchase a national security threat, and that even Ambassador Salazar sent a letter to the Mexican Foreign Ministry suggesting not to purchase this equipment. Mexico didnt stop and continues to buy this scanning equipment that will be placed in places like Tijuana for goods going into the U.S. What does it say when your Mexican partners disregard the U.S. concerns on this issue?\n\nMR PRICE: I dont think its fair to say that shared concerns have been disregarded. I we can let you know if we have any specific comments on these procurement decisions, but we typically dont comment on specific procurement decisions, but we do have a robust dialogue with our Mexican counterparts, including when it comes to border security issues. During the High-Level Security Dialogue that Secretary Blinken, Secretary Mayorkas, and Attorney General Garland took part in last month, there was a discussion of irregular migration, there was a discussion of the need to manage these challenges both in the region and closer to the border. Those are discussions that were continuing to have with our Mexican counterparts, and if we have anything to offer on a procurement decision, well let you know.\n\nQUESTION: But specifically on that, are you challenging the Washington Post reporting about Mexico purchasing these Chinese-linked technologies?\n\nMR PRICE: Im just not weighing in on a particular procurement decision.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Well, wait, wait a second. But you weigh in procurement decisions all the time. I mean, ask Turkey. Lets ask Europe when\n\nMR PRICE: I said\n\nQUESTION: When European countries are going around talking about Huawei and 5G and you guys are saying \"No, no, no.\" You weigh in on\n\nMR PRICE: And I said Im not weighing in on this particular procurement decision.\n\nQUESTION: Oh, this particular one? So its only when you feel like it.\n\nMR PRICE: Well let you know if we have anything to say on this one.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, back on China. The Department of Justice announced about an hour ago, give or take, that theyre charging several members of the Chinese Communist Party, the security apparatus there, with interfering in various affairs here in the U.S. Obviously, the DOJ is going to handle the criminal prosecutions, but when it comes to the Department of State, how are you guys going to respond to this threat and deal with it going forward? Some of the things they mentioned are things that have been going on for a while. Some of these people allegedly set up a fake think tank to try to influence American institutions. They tried to recruit former law enforcement, professors. These things have been happening for quite some time; theres been a lot of reporting about it. The DOJ, like I said, will do the criminal prosecution, but what are you guys doing to try to rein in this problem that seems to be still very pervasive?\n\nMR PRICE: I only saw these reports as I was walking out, and in any case we wouldnt comment on charges that have been unsealed by the Department of Justice. But more broadly, leaving aside what the Department of Justice alleged in a charging document today, what I can say is that this is a relationship that is multifaceted. We seek to cooperate with the PRC when it is in Americas national interests to do so. But this is a relationship that is primarily predicated on competition. And we are doing everything we can to compete and ultimately to out-compete with the PRC across the board. There are also elements of this relationship that are adversarial. And again, without speaking to any details that DOJ may have made public today, this certainly would seem to be in the category of adversarial elements of this relationship. Were clear-eyed about the multifaceted nature of this relationship. We are prepared for the competition, we are prepared to defend our interests when they are challenged by the PRC.\n\nLet me go to yes, I dont think youve had a question.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah. So on Russia, Ned, you have been talking about severe consequences for a long time. You have already conveyed them to Russians. Why dont you convey to the world as well whats going to be the result? Is there going to be consequences? Is it going to be military, or economic and political?\n\nMR PRICE: We think its important that the Russians know the profound nature of the consequences that would befall their country should they engage in nuclear use. At the same time, this is these are conversations that these are the types of conversations where we can be more pointed in private. We can convey very frank and sharp messages when we need to. And weve been also clear publicly that there will be profound consequences, but its not something that weve chosen to detail publicly.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Another question. Just on al-Hol camp, there is a report that the administration has enacted a plan to reduce the population at al-Hol camp in Syria, and six European countries and Australia has agreed to transfer some of their nationals back to their countries. Do you have anything on that\n\nMR PRICE: We welcome the efforts of our partners around the world, including our European partners, to repatriate their nationals. We think that it is the right and important thing to do, and its something we continue to discuss with them.\n\nElizabeth.\n\nQUESTION: Irans foreign minister said over the weekend that they had received a message indicating the U.S. was in a hurry to reach a nuclear agreement. Do you have any response to that, and has there been any indirect communication recently?\n\nMR PRICE: Of course there has been no such message to Iran. Those reports are not at all accurate. Our only message would be a simple one: stop killing your people. Stop sending weapons to Russia to kill Ukrainians. These are the same messages that we have conveyed publicly that we would convey privately.\n\nThank you all very much.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\n(The briefing was concluded at 3:09 p.m.)",

REUTERS/Andrea Comas Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nLONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - In Russia's latest advocacy campaign over its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has focused on accusations that Kyiv might be planning to use a so-called \"dirty bomb\" - a conventional explosive device laced with toxic nuclear material.\n\nKyiv and its Western allies say there is no truth at all to the accusation, and that the idea that Ukraine would poison its own territory is patently absurd. They say Moscow could be making the allegation to justify an escalation of its own.\n\nFollowing is a look at dirty bombs and how they might be used in Ukraine, either as a real threat or as the basis of propaganda:\n\nHOW MUCH DAMAGE CAN THEY DO?\n\nDirty bombs do not create city-flattening atomic explosion but are designed to spread toxic waste. Security experts have worried about them mostly as a form of terrorist weapon to be used on cities to cause havoc among civilians, rather than as a tactical device for use by warring parties in conflict.\n\nExperts say the immediate health impact would probably be limited, since most people in an affected area would be able to escape before experiencing lethal doses of radiation. But the economic damage could be massive from having to evacuate urban areas or even abandon whole cities.\n\nIn testimony to the United States Senate during the Obama administration, physicist Henry Kelly, then president of the Federation of Scientists, outlined a wide range of hypothetical scenarios, depending on the amount and type of nuclear material used and how far it was spread.\n\nA bomb using radioactive caesium from a misplaced or stolen medical device might require the evacuation of an area of several city blocks, making it unsafe for decades.\n\nA piece of radioactive cobalt from a food irradiation plant could, if blasted apart in a bomb in New York, contaminate a 380 square mile (1,000 square km) area and potentially make the island of Manhattan uninhabitable, Kelly said.\n\nWHAT DOES RUSSIA ALLEGE?\n\nMoscow sent a letter detailing its allegations about Kyiv to the United Nations late on Monday, and diplomats said Russia planned to raise the issue at a closed meeting with the Security Council on Tuesday.\n\nThe head of Russia's nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, told a media briefing Ukraine's aim for such an attack would be to blame Russia.\n\n\"The aim of the provocation would be to accuse Russia of using a weapon of mass destruction in the Ukrainian military theatre and by that means to launch a powerful anti-Russian campaign in the world, aimed at undermining trust in Moscow.\"\n\nWHAT IS THE RESPONSE OF UKRAINE AND THE WEST?\n\nKyiv and its Western allies say Moscow's allegation that Ukraine would intentionally make some of its own territory uninhabitable is absurd, especially at a time when Ukrainian forces are recapturing territory on the battlefield.\n\nIn a joint statement, the United States, Britain and France called the Russian allegations \"transparently false\" and warned Moscow against using them as a \"pretext\" for escalation.\n\nThe Kremlin warned the West on Tuesday it was dangerous to dismiss Moscow's position.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy suggested Moscow might be using the allegations as cover for plans for a similar attack of its own: \"If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this.\"\n\nEditing by Philippa Fletcher\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Instead, it could use radioactive materials from hospitals, nuclear power stations or research laboratories.\n\nThis makes them much cheaper and quicker to make than nuclear weapons. They can also be carried in the back of a vehicle, for example.\n\nBecause radioactive fallout can cause serious illnesses, such as cancer, such a bomb would cause panic among the targeted population.\n\nA wide area around the blast zone would also have to be evacuated for decontamination, or abandoned completely.\n\nThe Federation of American Scientists has calculated that if a bomb containing 9g (0.3oz) of cobalt-60 and 5kg of TNT were to be exploded at the tip of Manhattan, in New York, it would make the whole area of the city uninhabitable for decades.\n\nFor this reason, dirty bombs are known as weapons of mass disruption.\n\nHowever, as weapons, they are very unreliable.\n\nFor the radioactive material in a dirty bomb to be scattered across its target zone, it has to be reduced to powder form. But if the particles are too fine or released into strong winds, they will scatter too widely to do much harm.\n\nWhy did Russia make its 'dirty bomb' claim?\n\nThe US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has said Russia's defence minister \"likely sought to slow or suspend Western military aid to Ukraine and possibly weaken the Nato alliance in scare-mongering calls\".\n\nThere has also been speculation that Russia is planning to explode a dirty bomb in Ukraine itself and pin the blame on Ukrainian forces in a \"false flag\" attack.\n\nHowever, many military analysts say Russia would not be this foolhardy, given the damage a dirty bomb could do to its own troops and the territory under its control.\n\nThe ISW itself has said: \"The Kremlin is unlikely to be preparing an imminent false-flag dirty bomb attack.\"\n\nHas a dirty bomb been used before?\n\nThere has not yet been a successful dirty-bomb attack anywhere in the world.\n\nHowever, there have been attempts.\n\nIn 1996, rebels from Chechnya planted a bomb containing dynamite and caesium-137 in Moscow's Izmailovo Park.\n\nThe caesium had been extracted from cancer-treatment equipment.\n\nSecurity services discovered its location and it was defused.\n\nIn 1998, Chechnya's intelligence service found and defused a dirty bomb that had been placed near a railway line in Chechnya.\n\nIn 2002, Jose Padilla, a US citizen who had contacts with al-Qaeda, was arrested in Chicago on suspicion of planning a dirty-bomb attack.

In a recent post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump boasted: \"No President has done more for Israel than I have.\" He then complained that \"our wonderful Evangelicals are far more appreciative of this than the people of the Jewish faith, especially those living in the U.S.\"comments that raised age old antisemitic tropes about the dual loyalties of Jewsbefore ending with what seemed to be a threat: \"U.S. Jews have to get their act together and appreciate what they have in Israel Before it is too late!\"\n\nBlatant antisemitism aside, on the face of it, Trumps pro-Israel gestures during his presidency might seem to merit his claim. But any serious examination makes clear that when it came to actions that strengthened Israeli security and well-being, Trump fell far shortand proved to be far more pro-Trump and pro-former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than he was pro-Israel.\n\nIn many ways, Trumps actions actually weakened both Israels security and that of the Jewish community in the United States.\n\nRarely has a U.S. president showered Israel with as much attention, praise, and pro-Israel gestures as Trump. And despite recent reporting that revealed his deep frustrations with Netanyahu, the case has been madeprimarily by himself and his supportersthat Trump was Israels most devoted champion among U.S. presidents. Israel is one of the few (and perhaps the only) countries in the world where large majorities prefer Trump over U.S. President Joe Biden when it comes to foreign policy.\n\nAnd at first glance its easy to see why. Trump was the only modern U.S. president to visit Israel on his first trip abroad, the first U.S. president to recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital and open an embassy there, the first U.S. president to recognize the Golan Heights as sovereign Israeli territory, and the first sitting U.S. president to pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.\n\nStill, as important and resonant as these gestures may have been with U.S. and Israeli public opinion, especially the embassy move, they had little to do with improving Israeli security. In a piece for Foreign Policy, Shalom Lipner, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who worked for seven consecutive Israeli prime ministers, described them as largely rhetorical and symbolic. These were easy lifts for Trump, designed to burnish his credentials with evangelical Christians and to establish the Republican Party as Israels eternal friend.\n\nFar more significant and beneficial to Israel were Trumps son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushners efforts to cement Israels strategic ties with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Building on an emerging coincidence of interests between Israel and Gulf Arab states, the Trump administration facilitated the signing of the Abraham Accords, a set of agreements that would open extraordinary chapters in Israels relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and, perhaps in time, Saudi Arabia. And his administrations killing of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force leader Qasem Soleimani removed a major Iranian asset from the battlefield.\n\nAt the same time, as a result of acts of omission and commission, the Trump administration undermined Israels security. Trumps 2018 decision to withdraw unilaterally from the admittedly flawed but still functional Iran nuclear agreement created a vacuum that has led to Iran ramping up its nuclear program. Today, it stands just weeks away from producing enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon should it choose to take that step.\n\nThere wasnt much hope for serious progress on the Palestinian issue during the Trump years, but Trumps efforts to marginalize the Palestinians, weaken an already dysfunctional Palestinian Authority, and enable Israeli settlement activity made a tough issue that much harder. Trumps readiness to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria was viewed by many current and former Israeli military officials as a blow to Israels efforts to combat Iranprompting Maj. Gen. Amiram Levin, the former head of the Israel Defense Forces Northern Command, to remark that \"as long as Trump is in power, Israel has no one to rely on.\"\n\nAnd when Iran struck Saudi oil facilities in drone attacks in September 2019 and the Trump administration failed to respond, Maj. Gen. Amos Gilad, the former director of the Political-Military Affairs Bureau at Israels Defense Ministry, complained that Trumps \"no reaction policy when Iran attacks Saudi Arabian oil facilities or when Iran shoots down an American drone projects weakness. That is bad for Israel since American deterrence is Israeli deterrence as well.\"\n\nNor when measured against the accomplishments of other U.S. presidents does Trump rank first when it comes to supporting Israel or caring deeply about its security.\n\nHarry Truman was the first world leader to recognize the Jewish state, just 11 minutes after its creation was announced. Richard Nixons determinedly resupplied Israel with weapons during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, and he dispatched Henry Kissinger to negotiate disengagement agreements with Egypt and Syria that would lay the groundwork for Egyptian President Anwar Sadats historic 1977 trip to Jerusalem and Egyptian-Israeli peace. And despite his tensions with then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Jimmy Carter brokered an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty that eliminated the prospects of a two-front war against Israel. All of these actions were far more consequential for Israeli security and well-being than anything Trump accomplished.\n\nAnd in the care and commitment department, its hard not to see U.S. President Bill Clinton as well as Biden, whose support for Israel is deeply ingrained in their DNA, as sincerely devoted to the idea and reality of a Jewish state, in contrast to Trump, who tethered and subordinated U.S. policy on Israel to his personal vanity and political interests.\n\nIn 2018, Netanyahu visited the White House and praised Trump, placing him in the same pantheon as other historic benefactors of the Jewish people: Cyrus the Great, Lord Arthur Balfour, and Truman. Such flattery from Netanyahu was no surprise: Trump may not have been the most pro-Israel president in U.S. history, but he was certainly the most pro-Netanyahu, intervening to assist the prime minister in at least two of his reelection bids.\n\nThose who celebrate Trump as Israels best friend in the White House also conveniently overlook two other aspects of Trumps relationship with Israel and Jews that reflect poorly on the former president.\n\nFirst, like so many other dimensions of Trumps presidency, he subordinated his foreign policy to his personal politics. And the Israel issue was no exception. With help from Netanyahu, who long ago cast his lot with the Republican Party and its base, Trump damaged the bipartisanship on which the durability of the U.S.-Israel relationship depends. To secure his base, which includes white evangelical Christians and right-leaning Republicans, as well as to drive a political wedge within the American Jewish community, Trump has tried to make Republicans the go-to party for Israel while demonizing Democrats, cynically remarking in 2019 that \"if you vote for a Democrat, you are very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.\"\n\nHe has tried to turn the U.S.-Israel relationship into a morality play, pitting \"good\" Republicans against \"bad\" Democrats. But the strength of the U.S.-Israel alliance depends on a political consensus between Americas two main parties that the broadest conception of the U.S. national interest means robust support for Israel. The relationship with Israel cannot and should not depend on the desires and ambitions of a single party or politician.\n\nThe other, even darker, dimension of Trumps relationship with Israel and Jews involves his courting, enabling, and even supporting extremist forces that fuel antisemitism and anti-Israeli sentiments, including by perpetuating harmful antisemitic stereotypes himself, as he did in his most recent comments in which he suggested that somehow American Jews have a separate loyalty and stand apart from real Americans.\n\n\"We dont need the former president, who curries favor with extremists and antisemites, to lecture us about the US-Israel relationship,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive and national director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), said in a statement on Twitter on Sunday. The Biden White House was even more blunt, accusing Trump of aligning \"with extremist and antisemitic figures.\"\n\nFrom his comment after the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., that there were \"very fine people, on both sides,\" to his call to the far-right violent extremist group the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by,\" to his rallying right-wing extremist groups to march to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump has left a trail of tweets, statements, winks, and nods to white nationalist extremism and, equally important, hes failed to consistently condemn these racist outpourings or the ideology driving them.\n\nAccording to the ADL, 2021 witnessed the greatest increase in antisemitic incidents in the United States since the organization began tracking incidents in 1979. And though the ADL acknowledges its impossible to attribute this rise to any single source or ideology, a former president and elements within the Republican Party validating this poison only helps fuel this environment and raises the risk not just to Jews but to other minority groups as well.\n\nIn the end, Trump managed to shower Israel with a series of foreign policy favors that didnt contribute much to Israels security, as well as few initiatives that did. He also did a fair bit of damage. Its high time his supporters separate out his vainglorious gestures from the downsides of his actions. Trump wasnt Cyrus the Great, Lord Balfour, or Harry Truman. Had the former president really cared as much about Israel as he did about himself, the Jewish state, the U.S.-Israel relationship, and American Jews would definitely have been better off for it.",

                "cc_text": "Engineers at Ukraines Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) have been working to stabilize the facilitys fragile external power supplies following repeated outages earlier this month that forced it to temporarily rely on its emergency diesel generators for electricity, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today.\n\nWhile the nuclear safety and security situation at the ZNPP remains precarious, the plant over the past ten days has received the power it needs for reactor cooling and other essential safety and security functions directly and without interruption from the national grid, the Director General said, citing information from the IAEA experts present at the site.\n\nIn addition, Europes largest nuclear power plant currently also has back-up power available if needed through the switchyard of the nearby thermal power station. The switchyard was damaged by shelling on 19 October but repaired the following day. In recent days, the back-up power arrangements have also become more robust; a second interconnection at the 330 kilovolt (kV) thermal power plant switchyard was put into operation. This establishes a more reliable connection to the outside 330 kV power line to deliver off-site electricity to the ZNPP, if the main external connection were to fail again.\n\nEven with these improvements, Director General Grossi stressed that the ZNPPs power situation remained vulnerable only one 750 kV external power line is operating compared with four before the current military conflict in Ukraine and could deteriorate at any moment.\n\nEarlier this month, the ZNPPs connection to the 750 kV line was cut three times in ten days, with the last such power loss occurring on 17 October. During two of those off-site power cuts, the plants emergency diesel generators provided the required electricity, as the back-up system was also down.\n\nWhile there has been no shelling in the area of the ZNPP site over the past week, there have still been military activities in the vicinity of the site. \"This is absolutely no time for complacency. The situation could change dramatically at any point\" he said.\n\nTherefore, the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the facility remains of paramount importance, the Director General said. The Director General has in recent weeks engaged in high-level talks in Ukraine and the Russian Federation aimed at agreeing and implementing a protection zone as soon as possible.\n\nAt the ZNPP, Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate the plant, but there are more Russian technical staff now working at the site, and Russia has announced it has taken control of the facility, including now taking significant operational decisions, following the creation of a Russian state operating organisation for the site based in Moscow.\n\nDirector General Grossi, who has made it clear that he regards the ZNPP as a Ukrainian plant, expressed concern about possible confusion regarding the chain of command for the plants operation, which could negatively affect nuclear safety and security.\n\nFor example, senior Ukrainian operating staff had planned to restart reactor Unit 5 but it currently remains in a hot shutdown mode as Russian officials have not agreed to start it up again. In the meantime, Unit 5 is in hot shutdown providing steam for site operations, but plant staff state that another unit will also need to be placed in hot shutdown to supply all the sites needs in the future. The site is awaiting permission from Moscow to undertake this.\n\nRegarding recent reports about the ZNPPs dry spent fuel storage facility, the Director General said the IAEA was aware of work that is being carried out with the stated aim to upgrade the physical protection system there. The IAEA team at the site was informed about this work - including technical details on 14 October. For safeguards and other purposes, the IAEA continues to have access to this facility.\n\nSeparately today, Director General Grossi reiterated that IAEA inspectors this week would carry out verification activities at two locations in Ukraine, following a written request from the Ukraine government to send teams of inspectors there.\n\nUkraines request was issued after the Russian Federation made allegations about activities related to the possible production of \"dirty bombs\" at the two locations, which are under IAEA safeguards and have been visited regularly by IAEA inspectors. The purpose of this weeks safeguards visits is to detect any possible undeclared nuclear activities and materials related to the development of \"dirty bombs\". The IAEA inspected one of the two locations a month ago and no undeclared nuclear activities or materials were found there.\n\n\"The IAEA inspectors will conduct independent verification at these locations in accordance with Ukraines safeguards agreement to detect any diversion of nuclear material under safeguards, any undeclared production or processing of nuclear material at the two locations and assure that there are no undeclared nuclear material and activities,\" Director General Grossi said. \"As soon as our verifications are completed, we will assess the findings and report our conclusions in line with our standard safeguards practice. However, knowing the interest and urgency of this matter, the Agency will also provide our conclusions to the IAEA Board of Governors and immediately after to the public.\" Today, the Director General will be providing an update to the UN Security Council on this matter in a private session.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also accused Russia of planning to blow up a huge dam near Kherson and blame it on Ukrainians.\n\nSince Russia launched its war in Ukraine eight months ago, the U.S. has been speeding more than $17 billion in military aid, from shoulder-fired rockets, howitzers and armored vehicles to advanced air defense systems. U.S. lawmakers and officials in Europe, which is also providing billions in weapons, have in recent weeks stepped up calls for stiffer oversight.\n\nThe State Department is especially concerned about two classes of weapons: man-portable air defense systems, including the thousands of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles sent by the U.S., and anti-tank/all-purpose tactical guided missiles, including thousands of Javelins the U.S. sent.\n\nThe State Department said, as part of the plan, it is working with Kyiv to clear explosive remnants of the war, an activity that would enable \"on-the-ground accounting for and securing of weapons,\" the plan says.\n\n\"As in any conflict, we remain vigilant to the possibility that criminal and non-state actors may attempt to illicitly acquire weapons from sources in Ukraine, including members of the Russian military, during or following the conflict,\" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement.\n\nThe one-page plan released Thursday offered a number of actions, some for next year, others for 2024 and beyond but few details about how they would be implemented.\n\nAmong other steps in the plan, U.S. embassy personnel in Kyiv would help Ukraine increase weapons tracking. Beyond that, the State Department plans to bolster training for Ukrainian forces on protecting their borders and destroying found weapons and ammunition to deny them to non-state actors and protect civilians.\n\nIn the future, the U.S. also wants to deploy contracted de-mining units to work alongside Kyivs forces and train border forces to recognize man-portable air defense systems and anti-tank weapons.\n\nSo far, Ukrainian forces have been keeping small arms and other weapons from ending up on the black market and Ukraine has committed to safeguarding weapons donated by the U.S., but the plan acknowledges \"the chaotic nature of combat can make this difficult.\"\n\nThis summer, the European Union launched a new platform to discuss organized crime in the region with an eye toward the illegal smuggling of diverted weapons. The law enforcement agency Europol said then it was working with Ukrainian officials to reduce the risk of illegal arms transfers.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, in a June interview with the Financial Times, pushed back against western concerns the country could become a source of smuggled weapons, but acknowledged it needed to expand its arms tracking systems.\n\nReznikov disclosed that some of Ukraines allies had sent military representatives to the country to observe the flow of their donated weapons and he invited others to follow suit. He also said Ukraine was using NATO software, acquired in 2019, to monitor the destination and use of weapons provided by the west.\n\n\"We need to survive. We have no reason to smuggle arms out of Ukraine,\" he told the Financial Times.\n\nThe arms control community has been pressing the Biden administration for months to conduct stronger oversight. The number and variety of arms sent to Ukraine, and the potential they will overwhelm Ukraines ability to absorb and track them, have been worrisome to arms control advocates.\n\n\"The quantity of weapons that has gone to Ukraine already is larger than than any year to Afghanistan and Iraq since 9/11,\" said Rachel Stohl, the director of Stimson Centers conventional defense program. \"This [State Department tracking effort] is very much focused on the most high-tech sophisticated weapons. Light weapons have a huge diversion risk.\"\n\nStohl hailed the Biden administrations new plan for addressing these concerns, but she said it lacks details about implementation and said its effectiveness remains to be seen.\n\n\"Some of the things theyre laying out should be done as a matter of course. You shouldnt be transferring weapons to a recipient if you cant be sure how those weapon are being used or by the people you intended to use them,\" Stohl said.\n\nJoe Gould was the senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News, covering the intersection of national security policy, politics and the defense industry.

No further measures are planned,\" Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told President Vladimir Putin at a televised meeting in the Kremlin. He said 82,000 had already been sent to the combat zone and the rest were training.\n\nPutin thanked reservists \"for their dedication to duty, for their patriotism, for their firm determination to defend our country, to defend Russia, which means their home, their family, our citizens, our people.\"\n\nBoth men acknowledged \"problems\" in the early days of the call-up. Shoigu said initial issues in supplying newly mobilised troops had since been resolved. Putin said mistakes had probably been inevitable as Russia had not carried out a mobilisation for such a long time, but that lessons had been learned.\n\nThe mobilisation Putin ordered last month after his forces suffered major battlefield setbacks was the first time most Russians faced a direct personal impact from the \"special military operation\" he launched in February.\n\nMore than 2,000 people were arrested in anti-mobilisation protests, notably in parts of Russia populated by ethnic minorities who complained they were being disproportionately targeted to be sent to the front.\n\nESCALATION\n\nPutin ordered the call-up when he endorsed plans to annex Ukrainian lands. The West describes those moves as an escalation in response to battlefield setbacks that showed Russia was on course to lose the war.\n\nWestern military analysts have said the call-up could help ease Moscow's shortages of manpower along the 1,000-km (600-mile) front line, but the draft's military value will depend on whether Moscow can properly equip and train the reservists.\n\n[1/7]Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence, outside Moscow, Russia, October 28, 2022.

Serhiy Gaidai, the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, said on Friday Ukrainian troops had practically gained full control of an important road connecting Svatove and Kreminna, major towns seen as the next big battle front in the east. Reuters could not independently verify the claim.\n\nIn the south, Ukrainian forces have advanced this month towards Kherson, the biggest city Russia has captured intact since its February invasion. It is at the mouth of the wide Dnipro River that bisects Ukraine and the surrounding region controls land approaches to Crimea, which Moscow has held since 2014.\n\nThe Ukrainian advance appears to have slowed in recent days, however, with Kyiv blaming poor weather and tough terrain.\n\nTroops dug into muddy trench lines north of the city exchanged rocket, mortar and artillery fire.\n\nUkrainian soldiers manning a 120 mm mortar hidden in bushes loosed high explosive rounds in thundering bursts of flame at Russian positions around a grain silo less than a kilometre away.\n\nHennadyi, 51, said the Russians were using the silo for cover and observation. It poked like a finger above a vast expanse of fields, a column of smoke floating behind it.\n\nHennadyi said Ukrainian gunners were targeting Russian armoured vehicles and ammunition behind the silo and avoiding hitting the structure itself because of its importance to the agricultural region. But they did not have enough shells, he said.\n\n\"For every one shell that we send, they send back five,\" he said amid the shellfire duels. \"They shoot at us most of the time.\"\n\nRussia has ordered civilians out of a pocket of land it occupies on the west bank of the Dnipro, which includes Kherson city. Kyiv says the evacuation is cover for a forcible deportation of civilians by Russian forces, which Moscow denies.\n\nSergey Aksyonov, the leader of Crimea, said work had been completed on moving residents seeking to flee Kherson to regions of Russia ahead of Ukraine's expected counter-offensive.\n\nUkraine's general staff said hospital and business equipment was being removed from the area, while extra Russian forces were being deployed in empty homes.\n\nPutin's escalation in recent weeks has also included a new campaign to rain down missiles and Iranian-made suicide drones on Ukrainian civil infrastructure targets, particularly electricity substations.\n\nKyiv says the strikes are intended to freeze Ukrainians in winter and an intentional war crime. Moscow says it is permitted retaliation for Ukrainian attacks including a blast on a bridge to Crimea.\n\nIn Mykolaiv, a major Ukrainian-held city close to the Kherson front line, a missile blasted a huge crater outside a bakery overnight. Staff said two people were hurt by flying glass.\n\n\"At first, we did not hear anything probably got deafened by the blast. In time we found (each other), started calling out and found each other,\" Oksana Illyenko, a baker, told Reuters, recalling the explosion.\n\nReporting by Reuters bureaus; Writing by Peter Graff and David Brunnstrom; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Daniel Wallis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said the urgent call indicated that the occupiers \"do not expect a rapid Russian or civilian return\" to the city, and appeared to be trying to depopulate it to damage its \"long-term social and economic viability\".\n\nAll men remaining in Kherson have been invited to join a newly formed local militia. In a notice on Telegram, the occupation authorities said men had the \"opportunity\" to join territorial defence units if they chose to remain in Kherson of their own free will. Compelling civilians to serve in the armed forces of an occupying power is defined as a breach of the Geneva conventions.\n\nThe head of Ukraines defence intelligence directorate said Russia was bringing new military units into Kherson as it prepares to defend the city in the face of the advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive. Kyrylo Budanov also said Russia would slow Ukrainian troops advance in the south by only about two weeks if it blows up the Kakhova hyrdoelectric dam near Kherson.\n\nRussias defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has told western counterparts that the war in Ukraine is heading for an \"uncontrolled escalation\" amid evidence that the Kremlin is weighing how to respond to yet another anticipated battlefield defeat around the key southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe United Nations has said urgent steps are needed to relieve a backlog of more than 150 ships involved in a deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from ports in the Black Sea. Ukraine said Russian inspections that have been creating \"significant\" delays for the export of Ukrainian food products were \"politically motivated\" and a cause for concern. Russias foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow had asked the UN for data on the destination and end-consumers for Ukrainian grain exports, saying that \"corrections\" to the agreement would depend on this information.\n\nThe United States has no indications that Russia has made any decision to use a nuclear weapon, biological weapon or chemical weapon, a US military official has said. The US believes Russia is \"keeping lines of communication open\" after Moscow requested a call between US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu on Sunday, the official added.\n\nUkraine and the US denounced suggestions from Russia that Ukraine was preparing to use a \"dirty bomb\" as dangerous lies. \"If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,\" Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address. The White House national security council also rejected Shoigus claims. \"The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,\" a statement said.\n\nUkraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has asked the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, to send experts to Ukraines nuclear facilities to disprove Russian claims that Ukraine plans to use a \"dirty bomb\". The EUs foreign policy chief Josep Borrell welcomed Ukraines decision to request an expert mission from the UNs nuclear watchdog to examine its facilities.\n\nNatos secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said he spoke with the US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin and his British counterpart Ben Wallace about Russias evidence-free claim that Ukraine plans to use a \"dirty bomb\". The alliance rejects Moscows claims, he said, warning that Russia \"must not use it as a pretext for escalation\" in its war in Ukraine.\n\nRussias military chief of general staff Valery Gerasimov held calls with Britains chief of defence staff Tony Radakin and the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley on Monday. The Russian defence ministry said Radakin and his British and American counterparts discussed the possibility, raised by Moscow without providing any evidence, that Ukraine might use a \"dirty bomb\".\n\nUkraines president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged Israel to join the fight against Russia and repeated an appeal for Israeli air defence systems. Israel has condemned Russias invasion and has limited its assistance to deliveries of humanitarian aid and defensive equipment. Most recently it offered to help Ukrainians develop air attack alerts for civilians. Zelenskiy said that was not enough and asked that Israeli leaders reconsider sending air defences as well.\n\nUkraines special operations forces said that Iranian drone instructors have been spotted in Belarus. According to special operations forces, Irans Islamic revolutionary guard corps are training Russian forces in Belarus and coordinating the launches of Iranian-made drones.\n\nUkraine faces power outages after Russian strikes target energy facilities. Russian airstrikes on energy infastructure across the country have left more than a million households in Ukraine without electricity, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidency, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said at the weekend.\n\nRebuilding Ukraine will be a \"task for a generation\" that no country, donor or international institution can manage alone, Germanys chancellor Olaf Scholz said. Scholz said it was important to repair destroyed energy plants and networks but also to make them more efficient, to ultimately allow an expansion of Ukrainian electricity exports to the EU and a step-by-step transition to climate neutrality.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Ukrainians believe the country should keep up its armed resistance to Russias invasion, according to a new poll. The survey, conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) took place after two weeks of heavy Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv. It showed 86% said it was necessary to continue fighting even if missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities persist.\n\nA pro-Kremlin television presenter has been accused of inciting genocide after calling for Ukrainian children to be \"drowned\" and \"burned\" alive during an interview on the state-funded RT channel. Anton Krasovsky, the chief of Russian-language broadcasting for the channel formerly called Russia Today, was suspended from RT, and the head of Russias powerful investigative committee said it would review his remarks as part of a potential criminal investigation.\n\nUS basketball star Brittney Griner \"does not expect miracles\" at her appeal hearing on Tuesday, her lawyers said in a statement. The two-time Olympic gold medallist is appealing against a nine-year Russian jail term for drug possession and smuggling. Her lawyers said she would take part in Tuesdays hearing by video link from the detention centre where she has been held, and that they expected a verdict the same day.\n\n24 Oct 2022 13.22 EDT US basketball star Brittney Griner \"does not expect miracles\" at her appeal hearing tomorrow, her lawyers said in a statement. The two-time Olympic gold medallist is appealing against a nine-year Russian jail term for drug possession and smuggling.

They said: She is very nervous waiting for the appeal hearing. Brittney does not expect any miracles to happen but hopes that the appeal court will hear the arguments of the defence and reduce the term.\n\n24 Oct 2022 13.15 EDT Natos secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has spoken with the US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin and his British counterpart Ben Wallace about Russias evidence-free claim that Ukraine plans to use a \"dirty bomb\". The alliance rejects Moscows claims, he said, warning that Russia \"must not use it as a pretext for escalation\" in its war in Ukraine. Spoke with @SecDef & @BWallaceMP about #Russias false claim that #Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. #NATO Allies reject this allegation. Russia must not use it as a pretext for escalation. We remain steadfast in our support for Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg (@jensstoltenberg) October 24, 2022\n\n24 Oct 2022 12.38 EDT Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged Israel to join the fight against Russia and repeated an appeal for Israeli air defence systems. Zelenskiy said in a video speech to a conference for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz: Isnt it time for your state to choose who you are with as well? Is it with the democratic world, which is fighting side by side against the existential threat to its existence? Or with those who turn a blind eye to Russian terror, even when the cost of continued terror is the complete destruction of global security. Israel has refused to sell air defence weapons to Kyiv, wary of straining relations with Moscow despite reports that Iran is providing support for Russian pilots flying Iranian-made drones to bomb civilian targets in Ukraine. Moscow has denied its use of the Iranian drones against Ukrainian cities, but Tehran officials have confirmed it and said they will also supply ballistic missiles to help replenished Russias dwindling armoury. Israel has condemned Russias invasion and has limited its assistance to deliveries of humanitarian aid and defensive equipment. Most recently it offered to help Ukrainians develop air attack alerts for civilians. Speaking today, Preisident Zelenskiy said that was not enough and asked that Israeli leaders reconsider sending air defences as well.\n\n24 Oct 2022 12.04 EDT US has seen no indication Russia has decided to use nuclear weapon in Ukraine, says US official The United States has no indications that Russia has made any decision to use a nuclear weapon, biological weapon or chemical weapon, a US military official has said. From Foreign Policys Jack Detsch: NEW: U.S. has seen no intelligence to indicate that Russia has made any decision to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine: senior U.S. defense official Jack Detsch (@JackDetsch) October 24, 2022 U.S. believes that Russia is \"keeping lines of communication open\" after Russia requested a call between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Sunday.\n\nThe U.S. requested a call between Austin and Shoigu on Friday. Two calls in 48 hr Jack Detsch (@JackDetsch) October 24, 2022\n\nUpdated at 12.05 EDT\n\n24 Oct 2022 11.48 EDT An overwhelming majority of Ukrainians believe the country should keep up its armed resistance to Russias invasion, according to a new poll. The survey, conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) took place after two weeks of heavy Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv. It showed 86% said it was necessary to continue fighting even if missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities persist. The proportion of people backing continued armed resistance remained high, at 69%, even in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions which have seen more fighting and are home to larger numbers of Russian speakers. The results of the survey showed Russias shelling of Ukrainian cities had achieved the opposite of its intended aim \"to sow panic, despair and force Ukrainians to surrender\", the deputy director of KIIS Anton Hrushetskyi said. He added: Yes, the terror continues, people die or are injured, Ukrainian families are forced to spend their evenings in the dark. However, the national pain from losses and destruction does not frighten people. The Ukrainian people maintain strong unity and stability and are ready to continue the struggle to victory.\n\n24 Oct 2022 11.29 EDT Russian military chief holds calls with UK and US counterparts Russias military chief of general staff Valery Gerasimov has spoken with Britains chief of defence staff Tony Radakin and the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley today. The Russian defence ministry said Radakin and his British counterpart discussed the possibility, raised by Moscow without providing any evidence, that Ukraine might use a \"dirty bomb\". Radakin rejected Russias allegations that Ukraine is planning actions to escalate the conflict during the call, the British defence ministry said in a statement. An MoD spokesperson added: The military leaders both agreed on the importance of maintaining open channels of communication between the UK and Russia to manage the risk of miscalculation and to facilitate de-escalation. The conversation followed the defence secretarys call with his Russian counterpart yesterday and a call between the foreign ministers of France, the UK, and the USA last night. Shortly after, Radakin had a similar conversation with Milley.\n\n24 Oct 2022 10.58 EDT Olaf Scholz: Rebuilding Ukraine a 'task for a generation' Rebuilding Ukraine will be a \"task for a generation\" that no country, donor or international institution can manage alone, Germanys chancellor Olaf Scholz said. Speaking at a German-Ukrainian business forum, Scholz pointed to the EUs decision in June to make Ukraine a candidate to join the bloc. He said: This decision also sends a signal to private investors: anyone who invests in rebuilding Ukraine today is investing in a future EU member country that will be part of our legal community and our single market. Scholz said it was important to repair destroyed energy plants and networks but also to make them more efficient, to ultimately allow an expansion of Ukrainian electricity exports to the EU and a step-by-step transition to climate neutrality. He stressed the need for more transparency and \"an even more determined fight against corruption\" as Ukraine strives ultimately to join the bloc. Ukraines prime minister Denys Shmyhal told the forum that rebuilding will be a forward-looking process. During the meeting with @OlafScholz we discussed Ukraines recovery & important aspects of cooperation between the countries. I am grateful to the Chancellor for organising the #RecoveryOfUkraine conference & finding ways for long-term consolidated support for our country. 2/2 pic.twitter.com/AT2FxbICID Denys Shmyhal (@Denys_Shmyhal) October 24, 2022 system IRIS-T has been extremely effective in protecting Ukrainian sky.

Anton Krasovsky, the chief of Russian-language broadcasting for the channel formerly called Russia Today, said Ukrainian children who said they were being occupied by Russia should be \"thrown in a river with a strong undercurrent\". \"They should have been drowned in the Tysyna [river],\" said Krasovsky during an interview with the fantasy writer Sergei Lukyanenko. Just drown these children. Drown them. Anton Krasovsky was suspended from RT on Monday. Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/Reuters Russian state media has previously hosted commentators who have denied the existence of Ukrainian culture or called for the countrys total annexation by Russia. But even in the era of Russian wartime propaganda, where it appears that anything goes, Krasovskys remarks have provoked a backlash. On Monday, he was suspended from RT, and the head of Russias powerful investigative committee said it would review his remarks as part of a potential criminal investigation.

Russian claims that Ukraine is preparing to use a \"dirty bomb\" are another example of this use of blackmail, Podolyak said on Twitter. RF's only language of communication with the world is blackmail. Previously with food, energy, migrants, ZNPP. Now with a \"dirty bomb\", dam explosion. The reasons change, but Russian terrorist essence does not. The only way to end the endless ru-blackmail is victory. (@Podolyak_M) October 24, 2022",

Pavlo Kyrylenko said in televised remarks.\n\nThe southern Mykolaiv region also came under Russian shelling that targeted energy facilities.\n\nKyiv and seven other regions planned rolling blackouts Monday as authorities worked to fix the damage to energy facilities inflicted by the Russian bombardment.\n\nUkrainians were again asked to avoid using energy-hungry home appliances in an effort to lower the load on electricity networks.\n\n7:25 a.m.: Ukraine's national anti-corruption agency declared former central bank governor Kyrylo Shevchenko a wanted man on Monday along with two employees of the Ukrgazbank lender, on suspicion of embezzling more than $5.42 million (200 million hryvnia).\n\nShevchenko abruptly resigned this month citing health problems, but later saying he had faced political pressure after an old embezzlement case against him was reawakened immediately after his departure, Reuters reported.\n\nShevchenko assumed the post in July 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, promising to maintain the bank's independence and to cooperate with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIn resigning, he noted the bank's successes since the start of Russia's invasion on February 24 this year, including the uninterrupted operation of the financial system and its prevention of panic on the foreign exchange market and of large-scale capital outflow to protect reserves.\n\n7:05 a.m.: A U.N. spokesperson said on Monday that \"much more needs to be done\" to clear a backlog of more than 150 ships involved in a Black Sea grain-export deal, and Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations had all acknowledged the problem.\n\n\"There are currently over 150 vessels waiting around Istanbul to move and these delays have the potential to cause disruptions to the supply chain and port operations,\" said Ismini Palla, U.N. spokesperson for the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\n\nThe agreement, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July, paved the way for Ukraine to resume grain exports from Black Sea ports that had been shut since Russia invaded, Reuters reported. Moscow also won guarantees for its own grain and fertilizer exports.\n\n6:45 a.m.: French President Emmanuel Macron and Pope Francis held nearly an hour of private talks on Monday, with the crisis in Ukraine and prospects for peace there expected to have been their main topic of discussion.\n\nMacron, accompanied by his wife Brigitte, arrived at the Vatican and was greeted with an honor guard of Swiss Guards in the San Damaso courtyard before taking an elevator to the official papal study in the Apostolic Palace.\n\nThe Vatican said their private talks lasted 55 minutes. Both sides were expected to issue statements later.\n\nMacron is in Italy to attend an international conference organized by Italy's Sant'Egidio Community, a worldwide peace and charity group.\n\nHe and the pope will jointly close the conference at a special ceremony at the Colosseum in Rome on Tuesday, Reuters reported.\n\nOpening the conference on Rome's outskirts on Sunday, Macron said he believed there was a chance for peace in Ukraine, even as Russia warned the conflict could escalate.\n\nAs Macron meets Pope Francis, abuse victims urge swifter reparations.\n\n6:20 a.m.:\n\n6 a.m.: China's exports to sanctions-hit Russia rose at a double-digit pace for the third consecutive month in September, bucking the trend of weakening external demand elsewhere amid the Russia-Ukraine war and a global economic slowdown, Reuters reported.\n\nReuters calculations based on Chinese customs data on Monday showed shipments of Chinese goods to Russia rose 21.2% from a year earlier in dollar terms, slowing from a 26.5% increase in August yet outperforming China's overall export growth of 5.7% by a large margin, as interest rate hikes to curb red-hot inflation in major economies weakened demand for Chinese goods.\n\nTop exports to Russia included smartphones, generator sets, excavators and containers.\n\nImports from Russia jumped 55.2% compared with a 59.3% increase in August, partly driven by a 22% annual rise in oil imports, the customs data showed.\n\nOil supplies from Russia totaled 7.46 million tons, equivalent to 1.82 million barrels per day (bpd), compared with 1.96 million bpd in August.\n\nAs Western nations have shunned Russia, cooperation with Beijing has become increasingly important for Moscow. Bilateral trade has surged to $136.09 billion in value in the first nine months, up 32.5%.\n\n5:30 a.m. Russian authorities in the occupied territory of Kherson continue to encourage residents to flee in anticipation of a Ukrainian counter-offensive, according to The Guardian. The Russian-installed deputy head of the region Kirill Stremousov said about 25,000 people have been evacuated since Tuesday.\n\n4:30 a.m.: A Russian TV presenter apologized on Monday for calling for Ukrainian children to be drowned, as Russia's state Investigative Committee said it was probing his remarks, Reuters reported.\n\nIn a show last week on state-controlled broadcaster RT, presenter Anton Krasovsky said Ukrainian children who saw Russians as occupiers under the Soviet Union should have been \"thrown straight into a river with a strong current\" and drowned.\n\nUkraine said on Sunday that RT was an inciter of genocide and should be banned worldwide. Margarita Simonyan, the channel's editor-in-chief, said she had suspended Krasovsky because of his \"disgusting\" comments, adding that no one at RT shared his views.\n\nKrasovsky said in a social media post he was \"really embarrassed.\"\n\n4 a.m.: The Russian-installed administration of Ukraine's Kherson region said on Monday it was organizing some local men into militia units, Reuters reported.\n\nIn a notice on Telegram, the occupation authorities said men had the \"opportunity\" to join territorial defense units if they chose to remain in Kherson of their own free will.\n\nHowever, men in other occupied Ukrainian regions such as Donetsk have previously been compelled to join and fight with the armies of Russia's proxies in the war with Ukraine.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin last week declared martial law in the occupied regions, empowering their Russian-installed administrations to step up mobilization.\n\nCompelling civilians to serve in the armed forces of an occupying power is defined as a breach of the Geneva Conventions on conduct in war.\n\nRussian authorities have ordered civilians to evacuate from Kherson, one of four Ukrainian regions Russia said it had annexed last month even as Kyiv's forces have made significant military gains.\n\nRussia and its proxies in Kherson have stepped up the urgency of their warnings to leave in the face of Ukraine's counter-offensive.\n\n\"It's vital to save your lives,\" Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said in a video message on Sunday.\n\n3:15 a.m.: Two Russian Indigenous Siberians were so scared of having to fight the war in Ukraine, they changed everything to take a small boat across the treacherous Bering Sea to reach American soil, Alaskas senior U.S. senator said after talking with the two.\n\nThe two, identified as males by a resident, landed earlier this month near Gambell, on Alaskas St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Strait, where they asked for asylum.\n\n\"They feared for their lives because of Russia, who is targeting minority populations, for conscription into service in Ukraine,\" Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Saturday during a candidate forum at the Alaska Federation of Natives conference in Anchorage.\n\n\"It is very clear to me that these individuals were in fear, so much in fear of their own government that they risked their lives and took a 15-foot skiff across those open waters,\" Murkowski said when answering a question about Arctic policy.\n\nThousands of Russian men fled the country after Putin announced a mobilization in September to call up about 300,000 men to bolster Russias depleting forces in Ukraine.\n\n2:30 a.m.: Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Renikov said he would be talking Monday with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin about \"another act of Russian nuclear blackmail and response of the Free World.\"\n\nThe foreign ministers of the United States, Britain and France reiterated their support for Ukraine in a statement late Sunday, and said their defense ministers made clear to Russias Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu their rejection of \"Russias transparently false allegations.\"\n\nFor Austin, his phone call Sunday with Shoigu was the second between the two ministers in three days. The Pentagon said Austin rejected any pretext for Russian escalation and reaffirmed the value of continued communication amid \"Russias unlawful and unjustified war against Ukraine.\"\n\n2 a.m.: Russia continues to use Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) against targets throughout the Ukrainian territory, the British Ministry of Defense said on Monday.\n\nRussia is likely using the Iranian Shahed-136 UAVs to infiltrate Ukrainian air defenses and as a substitute for Russian-manufactured long-range precision weapons that are becoming increasingly scarce, the ministry said in its update on Twitter.\n\nUkrainian efforts to contain the UAVs have been successful, the ministry said.\n\n1 a.m.: Ukraine rejected Russia's allegations that Ukrainian forces might detonate a radioactive device, and accused Russia of planning to carry out such an act and blame it on Ukraine.\n\n\"Russian lies about Ukraine allegedly planning to us a dirty bomb are as absurd as they are dangerous,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during his nightly address Sunday that Russia was the only one in the region capable of using nuclear weapons.\n\n\"If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I believe that now the world should react in the toughest possible way.\"\n\n12:05 a.m.: U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, will attend a forum in Zagreb this week aimed at supporting Ukraine's independence and the return of the Crimean peninsula to Kyiv, her office announced on Sunday, according to a Reuters report.\n\n\"Discussions will be centered on the international community's efforts to support the Ukrainian people while holding Russia accountable for its documented war crimes and attempted illegal annexations,\" Pelosi's office said in a statement.\n\nPelosi, who visited the war-torn country earlier this year, has been a strong supporter of providing aid and military assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded it on February 24.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n\n3:40 P.M. EDT\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Hello.\n\nQ Heads up.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Heads up. Heads up.\n\nQ Sorry.\n\nQ Good to see you.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Starting with you or without you.\n\nGood afternoon, everybody. I do want to take a couple of minutes to make some announcements that all of you already know, but its been a few weeks now and I want to make sure I acknowledge some new additions and well- well-earned promotions on our press team. You know how we how much we love to lift our our team up here.\n\nSo, Andrew Bates will be taking on additional responsibilities, adding the role of Senior Communications Advisor for Strategic Response to his portfolio. Andrew has been a tireless and talented spokesperson on our team. And in his expanded role, he will have an increased focus on rapid response.\n\nEmilie Simons has been promoted, as you all know, to Deputy Press Secretary. Emily has been a star leading our econ war room work and has grow- has grown into a strong leader and mentor on the press team. We are so proud to have to have her stepping into the role of Deputy Press Secretary and taking on even more. As you all know, some of you have been dealing with her closely on some parts of her new role.\n\nIn the upcoming days, well also be welcoming our former Press Assistant, Michael Kikukawa, who many many of you know. Hell be coming back to the press team as Assistant Press Secretary. Kiku, as many of us know him as very fondly, will be returning to our team from Treasury and taking on Emilys econ portfolio.\n\nAnd lastly, Robyn Patterson, who some of you have already been working with, has come over to our team on loan from the Department of Commerce and will serve as Assistant Press Secretary through the spring. She brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to our team, and we are grateful to have her on board.\n\nCongratulat- congratulations to our team on these well-deserved, well-earned promotions.\n\nSo as you saw this morning, the President announced new action by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB making clear two types of banking junk fees that cost Americans more than $1 billion annually, are illegal, including surprise overdraft fees and bounced bounced check victim fees, which are fees charged to customers who deposit someone elses bounced check.\n\nAs CFP- FPB Director Chopra said this morning, todays actions are just the beginning. His team is working on future rules and guidance that would take on credit card and other banking fees.\n\nThe President also highlighted recent actions by the FTC to crack down on unfair and deceptive fees across industries, such as charging consumer fees they never agreed to or charging mandatory fees with little or no added value like hotel resort fees or event ticket processing fees. These fees seriously add up. Credit card late fees, overdraft and bounced check fees, can cost customers more than $24 billion per year. And these important steps announced today will give Americans, as we say, as the President says, a little bit more of a breathing room.\n\nNow, it has been 40 days since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of Irans so-called morality police. We join her family and the Iranian people for a day of mourning and reflection.\n\nThe President said it at the U.N. General Assembly, and it remains true quote: \"We stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.\" End quote.\n\nWe are concerned that Moscow may be advising Tehran on best practices to manage protests, drawing on Russias extensive experience in suppressing open demonstrations. The evidence that Iran is helping Russia wage its war against Ukraine is clear and it is public. And Iran and Russia are growing closer the more isolated they become.\n\nOur message to Iran is very, very clear: Stop killing your people and stop sending weapons to Russia to kill Ukrainians.\n\nWe remain committed to ensuring that those responsible for the brutal crackdown on those courageous protesters are held accountable.\n\nToday we are announcing a joint action between the State and Treasury Departments designating 14 individuals and 3 entities using five different authorities, demonstrating our commitment to use all appropriate tools to hold all level of the Iranian government to account.\n\nSpecifically, we are designating Iranian government officials who hold leadership positions within Irans police and prison systems and who are responsible for or complicit in serious human rights abuses. We are designating the governor of the province of Sistan and Baluche- Baluchestan for his role in overseeing the violent response by security forces against peaceful protesters.\n\nWe are designating individuals who are actively serve as commanders in the IRGC for their brutal response to protesters. And we are designating two entities involved in censorship, surveillance, and malicious cyber activity against the Iranian people.\n\nThe United States stands with Iran- Iranian women and with all the citizens of Iran who are inspiring the world with their bravery. We will continue taking action to impose costs on those who commit violence against peaceful protesters or otherwise seek to suppress their very, very basic rights.\n\nAnd with that, I will turn to turn it turn it over to my NSC colleague, John Kirby, whos here to take some few questions.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Thanks, Karine.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No problem.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Just a couple of things at the top. As you know, President Biden was pleased to welcome the Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, to the White House earlier this afternoon. The two leaders discussed the enduring strength of the U.S.-Israeli partnership, all the ways that we can deepen cooperation between the two countries, and, of course, our unshakable commitment to Israels security.\n\nThey also consulted on a wide range of global and regional issues of mutual concern, including the threats posed by Iran and its proxies. The President emphasized that his administration has pledged to ensure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.\n\nThey also celebrated the forthcoming conclusion of a historic agreement concerning the maritime boundary dispute between Israel and Lebanon, and that was mediated by the United States. President Biden praised Israels statecraft and their courage, and noted that the agreement will set the stage for a much more stable and prosperous region, as well as being able to harness vital new energy sources for the world.\n\nThe President also made clear his commitment to advance peace and stability in the Middle East and highlighted U.S. support for Israels further regional integration into the Arab world. He emphasized the importance of taking steps to deescalate the security situation in the West Bank and underscored that a negotiated two-state solution remains the best avenue to achieve a lasting peace.\n\nHe also underlined the need to take continued steps to improve the lives of Palestinians, which are, of course, critical to peace, security, and prosperity in the region.\n\nI think you know just a second I think you know hes meeting with senior defense leaders right now. This is part of a semi-annual Senior Leaders Conference that the Pentagon hosts twice a year, bringing together all the commanders of the 11 combatant commands, as well as the leadership, both civilian and military, of each of the six branches of service.\n\nComing right in the wake of the release of the National Security Strategy, the timing just couldnt be better for for having this discussion this afternoon with these leaders. And I suspect youll see that theyll theyll discuss a wide range of issues regarding our national security, all the way from managing the strategic competition with China to the acute threat that Russia is clearly posing on the European continent, to the threat the threat of climate change and what thats doing to our own facilities and our own ability to meet to meet the nations needs here and around the world, as well as a whole range of other issues.\n\nSo, lots to discuss today, and I know hes looking forward to having that.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Zeke.\n\nQ Thanks, John, Karine. Im hoping you might be able to provide a little bit more context and evidence to back Karines allegation before that Moscow may be supporting Irans crackdown on its civilian population. What expertise does the U.S. believe Moscow is providing, and what evidence do you have to back up that?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im not going to get into too much of the of the sources of the information here at the podium. Karine wasnt putting forth an allegation. She was putting forth a fact that we know they may be considering some sort of support to Irans ability to crack down on protesters. And sadly, Russia has experience at doing that.\n\nSo, well see. Well watch where this goes. But its just yet another example of Russia and Iran now working together to violate the not only the human rights and civil rights of people in Iran, but, of course, put in further danger the lives of Ukrainians.\n\nQ But has that support begun or is it just Moscow considering that?\n\nMR. KIRBY: What I would say is, we have we see signs that they that they may be considering the ability to help train Iranians on cracking down on protesters.\n\nQ Right. But it has not begun already?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I wont I dont want to go too much into more detail. I would just say: Weve seen signs that they may be considering lending that kind of support to Iran.\n\nQ Okay. But thats just an important point of clarification, because the transcript, I believe, will read: \"We are concerned that Moscow may be advising Iran.\" So, these are two different things. Were con- youre considering\n\nMR. KIRBY: May be advising.\n\nQ may be advising, already happening\n\nMR. KIRBY: May be advising.\n\nQ considering advising?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Right. \"May be advising.\" Yeah.\n\nQ Thank you. And then, on Brittney Griner, Im assuming you saw the comment from Peskov this morning\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah.\n\nQ in which he said all contacts of this sort should be held in quiet. Is this a signal of some kind? Are you interpreting this as a signal of some kind that theyre open to increased dialogue, further dialogue? Or has there been any more dialogue since the verdict, since yesterdays decision, court ruling?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont have anything since yesterdays court ruling for her appeal to talk about.\n\nBut I would tell you that the conversations with the Russians that they continue. They havent stopped. And so, that channel is still open, and were still trying to use it to bring her and Mr. Whelan home.\n\nQ Did President Herzog provide any more specifics to the President today about Irans UAVs or things that they have been able to do to assist Russia inside Ukraine? Did he bring that intelligence?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im not going to go beyond the readout, Kelly. Ill let President Herzog characterize his side of the conversation. I know there were press reports before the meeting that he was considering doing that.\n\nWeve already spoken to it, though. I mean, weve already talked about the fact that we that we knew Iran was providing UAV drone capability to the Russians. And, in fact, we already talked about publicly the fact that we know that theyve got guys on the ground there in Crimea that are helping provide technical assistance and training support for for Russian soldiers to actually pilot these things.\n\nSo, again, Ill let President Herzog characterize his side of the conversation. But this is a this is a concern weve not only had and harbored, but have spoken to publicly.\n\nQ Thank you. The Iranian foreign minister keeps repeating, saying that the administration is sending messages that they want to reengage in the nuclear talks. Is this true? And do you think the time is suitable to reengage?\n\nAnd secondly, Karine said that the administration message to the Iranian regime is: Dont kill their own people and dont send weapons to the Russians. Do you think this message will resonate with the Iranian regime?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Well, on your first question: No, we are not seeking or asking for a new set of negotiations or renegotiation discussions on the JCPOA. Thats not what our focus on is on right now. Its on holding Iran accountable, as Karine mentioned in the opening statement, for the way theyre treating innocent protesters in their country. Thats our focus right now, not on getting back into the JCPOA. And frankly, we are just too far apart right now to be able to have any meaningful discussions in that regard.\n\nAnd on your second question, I mean, it never ceases to amaze me what doesnt seem to be able to soak in, in terms of message delivery to Iranian leaders. Weve been very clear about our concerns over what theyre doing to their own people. Weve been very clear about what theyre doing to enable the Russians to kill Ukrainians and to damage Ukrainian infrastructure. Theyre now on the ground in Crimea, assisting in that effort.\n\nThe transfer of these drones absolutely is a violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which prohibits the transfer of missile-related goods, equipment, and technologies to or from Iran. So, I cant I dont think we can be any more clear about our concern about what theyre doing.\n\nAnd were going to continue to work with allies and partners and with the U.N. to see if theres additional ways to hold them accountable. Karine mentioned, just with respect to the treatment of protesters, another 14 now sanctions in place just today. And were going to continue to stay at it.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, John.\n\nQ Admiral, it has now been exactly a month a full month since the explosions the Nord Stream pipelines. Is there any update on the investigation as to what happened there?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont have an update for you, Jonathan. We still believe it was an act of sabotage. Theres investigations that are ongoing. Im not going to get ahead of them.\n\nQ Any suggestion as to who conducted the sabotage?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im not going to get ahead of ongoing investigations.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Weijia.\n\nQ Thank you. John, I wanted to ask you about Saudi oil production. Over the summer, did the U.S. strike a deal with Saudi Arabia to boost oil production?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Look, there was we talked about it before the trip, that that energy security was going to be something the President talked about when we went; that we were having conversations with Saudi Arabia before the trip about better balancing supply and demand. And and obviously, when you heard the President himself, in Jeddah, after the bilateral conversation that we had that, that he was hopeful that there would be a boost in production. There was a boost in production afterward.\n\nWhat I would tell you is Ive seen the press reporting on this. There were discussions before the trip, obviously, about a better balance of supply and demand to stabilize the energy market. Of course, there was. And we talked about that openly.\n\nBut this recent decision by OPEC+ to now cut the these 2 million barrels certainly isnt not and Karine said this a gazillion times its not in keeping with the with what we believe was the actual mathematical analysis of what needed to be done for supply and demand at a time when supply is the predominant challenge. We didnt believe it was in keeping with that, and it certainly wasnt in keeping with the conversations that that we were having.\n\nQ But did those conversations ever culminate in a concrete deal with Saudi Arabia? Did Saudi Arabia ever agree that they would boost oil production?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Again, Im going to go back to what I said before: There were conversations before the trip, as you might imagine there would be, about about an architecture that could better balance supply and demand to include what was what ended up as an increase in production at the end of the trip. I think Im just going to leave it there.\n\nQ And then, just a quick follow-up then on OPECs decision, because the President said there could be consequences. Do you have any update on what those might be?\n\nMR. KIRBY: No. And the Presidents national security team is taking a look at that right now, internal here to the National Security Council, looking at options, looking at this bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia, and and what what options we would like to tee up to the President for him to consider going forward.\n\nBut the President also said he wants to talk to members of Congress. And obviously, the members of Congress are are not not here in town. So, were not in a hurry. And we dont need to be in a hurry.\n\nBut clearly, the President believes that we need to make sure this bilateral relationship quite frankly, like every bilateral relationship we have with friends, partners, and allies is suited to the national interests of the United States of America and to the security interests of the American people. And thats what hes going to stay focused on. But no, I dont have a specific update for you.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Steve.\n\nQ Staying on that topic, the Saudi energy minister said yesterday that when it comes to this conversation, his country is taking the \"mature\" route. He said that at the conference known as \"Davos on the Desert,\" on the global stage\n\nMR. KIRBY: I saw it.\n\nQ among the worlds leading financiers.\n\nMR. KIRBY: I saw it.\n\nQ You saw it. So, what do you make of the implication, then, that the U.S. is acting immature?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I, obviously, refute that, of course. This isnt a you know, look, this isnt you know, its not like some high school romance here. Were talking about a significant, important bilateral relationship a partnership that has survived over 80 years an important partnership, a strategic partnership. We said that even before the trip.\n\nAnd I dont think talking about it in in terms like that necessarily lends the gravity of how important this relationship is to to the way that were considering it.\n\nThe decision was was regretful. It was, as the President said, a \"mistake\" to make that cut. It was certainly not in keeping with our analysis of what needed to be done to help better balance supply and demand on the market.\n\nNow, look, it were we have not seen the decision itself result in an increase in oil prices. In fact, oil prices continue to come down. Theyre down like 30 percent right now from June. And, of course, prices at the pump here in the United States are down about a $1.20 since about that same timeframe.\n\nSo we havent seen a radical effect here on on prices. But that doesnt mean that that that were all of a sudden happy about the decision. At a time, as I mentioned before, when supply on the market is the predominant challenge, we felt that this was shortsighted.\n\nAnd again, were going to were going to obviously take a look at the relationship going forward. And I can assure you that whatever this relationship looks like at the end of that process, its going to be where how we get there is going to be done in a very deliberate, measured way, keeping in mind our national security interest and those of the American people, the American troops, and the American citizens that live over there 70,000 of them in Saudi Arabia as well as the strategic partnership that we have had for eight decades with Saudi Arabia. All of that will be factored in.\n\nQ If I can ask a question on a completely separate matter. On word yesterday from the President that the U.S. has been in constant contact with Russia, the parents of Austin Tice, the reporter whos been missing for 10 years in Syria, reached out to CBS News.\n\nAnd they asked this question, which Ill pose to you: Why has Jake Sullivan not followed the Presidents directive of May 2nd to get a meeting with the Syrians?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im not going to get into Jakes individual schedule. What I will tell you first of all, obviously, our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to the Tice family. And obviously we want to see Austin home. No doubt about that. And we continue to work this very, very hard.\n\nI dont have anything on Jakes schedule to talk about, but I can assure you that the national security team is still focused on this.\n\nQ Do we believe hes alive, John?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Were still focused were still focused on on Mr. Tice.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Jacqui.\n\nQ Thank you, Karine.\n\nJohn, the Saudis took a veiled shot at the administration for selling the countrys emergency oil reserves and said that that decision may become a painful one in the next few months. Is there any indication that they plan to further cut production?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Id have to refer you to them, Jacqui. I dont have insight into what you know, what their future decisions will or wont be.\n\nWe did propose that they not make a decision right now and wait until the next scheduled meeting, which was very early next month. So well see what they end up doing at this next at this next meeting.\n\nQ Do you feel that the administration has sufficient insight into what foreign governments are going to do, given the reporting that the U.S. thought that there was a deal to boost production through the end of the year, that the decision from the Saudis and OPEC+ came as a surprise and caused a bit of a meltdown in the West Wing? And your answer just now saying that, you know, dont have insight into what they might be doing, is that at all a failure of our diplomacy or foreign policy?\n\nMR. KIRBY: No. I mean, theres a lot there.\n\nFirst of all, we didnt have a meltdown. Secondly, while we dont we cant predict perfectly what OPEC+ is going to decide to do, the were not part of that cartel. Its not like we dont have ongoing discussions with the Saudis and with other members of OPEC; we do. And we try to get the best information we can. Obviously, they have to make the decisions that theyre going to make. So well see where where they go on this on this next meeting.\n\nWhat I can speak to is President Bidens priorities, and thats making sure that we continue to keep the price going down and to reduce the pain at the pump for the American people and to try to do what we can in a measured, deliberate way to help better balance supply and demand inside the global market. And it is a global market. And I think that sometimes gets forgotten.\n\nQ What are we doing to increase the supply of diesel, given that the Energy Information Administration said, as of October 14th, the U.S. only had about a 25-day supply? You have the northeast and New York already rationing home heating oil. What are we doing to prepare for the winter and to ramp up the supply of diesel?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Ill take the question on the diesel, because I just dont have the data on that in front of me. So let me take that, and well get back to you on that.\n\nBut but writ large, the President has been working very, very hard to make sure that were that not only are we ready for fluctuations that could come and, of course, the prices are going down, and we think thats important but that we are also doing what we can to help our European friends and partners who are also going to be facing a long, cold winter.\n\nWe have doubled our commitment. The commitment he made in March for natural gas exports to Europe, weve doubled that commitment in terms of actual you know, getting things over there, getting natural gas over there. And we are working with foreign suppliers of natural gas and oil to see if we can help our European partners diversify their own storage and supplies.\n\nMany of them are, in fact, building up their storage capability here for the winter. Some are farther along than others. And were working closely with them bilaterally and multilaterally to see what we can do to help that.\n\nBut I will owe you a question on the diesel.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Jeremy, and then Trevor.\n\nQ On the dirty bomb allegations that Moscow is making, Im wondering if you can walk us through some of the potential scenarios that the U.S. sees here.\n\nAs it relates to Russia potentially planning or executing a false-flag operation, do you anticipate that its that they will use the mere threat of a dirty bomb by Ukraine as an excuse to retaliate with a tactical nuclear weapon? Or do you anticipate that they would actually deploy a dirty bomb themselves, blame Ukraine, and then use the tactical nuclear weapon? How does the U.S. see this?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah, let me start the question what I would normally do at the back end and thats to say that we havent seen any indications that the Russians are making preparations for the use of a dirty bomb or, quite frankly, the use of tactical nuclear weapons. I think thats important to get right out front.\n\nIt is a common Russian play for them to blame others for what they are doing themselves or about to do themselves, which is why we took it very seriously when the Russian defense minister called the Secretary of Defense and said that they had information that the Ukrainians were fixing to use a dirty bomb to obviously, its a false allegation. Thats not true. The Ukrainians have nothing like that in mind. They have no intention to do that. So thats why we take thats why we take it seriously.\n\nNow, the question youre asking is: Are they just using the threat of it or are they actually doing it? Again, weve not seen any indications that theyre making any preps to do that.\n\nI wish I could get inside the Russian mindset here and tell you exactly what theyre thinking with respect to why they put this out there. I cant do that. All I can do is tell you we took it seriously, weve spoken about it publicly, were monitoring it as best we can as best we can and were going to make sure that we can continue to do what we have to do to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nQ So are you preparing for both of those scenarios?\n\nMR. KIRBY: We are making sure that Ukraine can defend itself against a range of threats that the Russians are posing inside Ukraine. And I think Im going to leave it there.\n\nQ And lastly, youve made clear that Russia using a tactical nuclear weapon would be crossing a very significant line. Do you view the use of a dirty bomb as crossing that same line?\n\nMR. KIRBY: The use of a dirty bomb would would cause would cause significant casualties, depending on the size of it, and certainly follow-on casualties as well from radiation exposure.\n\nIm not going to classify it one way or the other except to say that it would be yet another example of Russias brutality on the Ukrainian people, another level of atrocity if they were to do it, that that would have to be dealt with and properly and they would have to be properly held accountable accountable for it.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Trevor. And then well go to the back.\n\nQ Does the White House agree with President Zelenskyys comments this week that Israel needs to step up its support for for Ukraine and specifically to provide air defenses?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Thats for thats for the Israelis to decide. You know, theres more than 50-some-odd nations that are providing some measure of assistance to Ukraine, most of it in the security realm weapons, non-lethal, money that Secretary Austin holds the Ukraine Contact Group meeting; now I think hes had six or seven of them.\n\nAnd heres the thing about it: Every nation that comes to that meeting, they do it on their own terms, and they decide for themselves what theyre willing to provide to Ukraine.\n\nSo, not long ago, we were all talking about Germany, because, you know, there were there were issues about what Germany was doing or not doing. Germany has evolved its own contributions over time. We have evolved our contributions over time.\n\nI mean, when the war first started, we were all talking about Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stingers, right? Now were talking about advanced rocket systems and howitzers and air defense capabilities that they clearly need.\n\nSo the war changes, the capabilities change with it. And every nation state thats providing support to Ukraine, they got to do it on their own terms, because they have their own national security concerns they have to look after too.\n\nSo were not were not cajoling. Were not arm twisting. Were not poking. We are asking. And were holding these Ukraine Contact Group meetings to provide a venue and a vehicle for our nations to come forward and contribute. But they got to do it on their own.\n\nAnd, look, the relationship with as you saw today, with Israel is very, very strong unshakable, as we like to say and we respect that Israel has to make these decisions for themselves.\n\nQ And just to follow up on that, I mean, the U.S. has put billions of dollars into Iron Dome. Do you think that that technology that the U.S. has significantly funded should be used in Ukraine?\n\nMR. KIRBY: That is going to have to be a decision for the Israeli leaders to make. But for our part, were going to continue to we have provided air defense capabilities to the Ukrainians since the beginning of the conflict. We are continuing to do that. Well continue to look forward for other look at other capabilities that they might be able to use.\n\nAnd it doesnt just have to be systems coming from the United States or even systems that the United States helped fund. It can be air defense capabilities that other nations have that the Ukrainians are more more familiar with or better trained on. They you know, they have they have you know, they have the tech support to support them.\n\nSo, were going to work across the across the across the board.\n\nQ And just finally on Israel, do you agree with Senator Robert Menendez that the inclusion of far-right lawmakers in a governing coalition in Israel would threaten U.S ties and threaten peace in the Middle East?\n\nMR. KIRBY: The the kind of government that the Israeli people put in place is up to them. Its a democracy; they get to decide that.\n\nWere confident in this bilateral relationship and the strength of it. Were confident that no matter who the Israeli people elect, were going to be able to work with them going forward. There is an awful lot of shared challenges.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.\n\nQ Thank you, Karine. Thanks, John. I want to follow up on Trevors question in regards to Ukraines request for Israeli air defense system. So I guess I just want more detail: Does the President under-\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im sure you do. (Laughter.)\n\nQ Does the President understand that Israel cannot poke Russia too much, considering its security interest in Syria? Or I mean, you said there was no arm twisting, but was there even a conversation about asking President Herzog or asking Israel to reconsider about supplying these air defense system to Ukraine?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im going to leave the conversation to the readout and what you heard the President say today. We are not taking a position where were trying to put a guilt trip on a country to contribute a specific capability to Ukraine.\n\nWe are talking and they talked today about Ukraine, of course. Were talking to countries all around the world about about what we can collectively do to support Ukraine and certainly what theyre willing to do to support Ukraine. But its got to be their decision.\n\nQ And a follow-up on the drones the Iranian drones to Russia. Youve mentioned that it violates U.N. Security Council.\n\nMR. KIRBY: It does.\n\nQ But does the administration believe that it that Iran, by doing these transfers, is committing or at least complicit in war crimes or violating international (inaudible)?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Theres a we, as well as some of our partners at the U.N., have called for an investigation into this exact issue, so Im not going to get ahead of that. We do think it should be it should be investigated.\n\nBut you can go online and look at 2231 yourself, and it clearly says no transfer of of missile-related items, goods, technology, or equipment to or from Iran. Clearly, they theyre doing that inside inside Ukraine and to help and to help Russia.\n\nI think were stepping back just a little bit, this is you know, Karine alluded to this at the top: Its another this whole relationship is another indication of how isolated both nations are from the rest of the international community.\n\nIts also an indication of two things, in my mind: One, Putin has no intention of sitting down at the negotiating table anytime soon. And two, that his own defense industrial base has been hurt now by the sanctions and export controls that he has to rely on a country like Iran to provide these unmanned aerial vehicles, which are were not talking about ISR intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance platforms that can image things below. These are basically kamikaze drones. Theyre meant for one purpose and one purpose only, and thats to go hit a target, go kill people, go destroy infrastructure.\n\nThat hes doing that speaks to the brutality hes willing to continue to prosecute this war, certainly no interest in sitting down, and that he is having trouble in his own defense industrial base that he has to turn to another country like that.\n\nQ And just to follow up on the regional air defense system that the U.S. is trying to help facilitate in the Middle East, can you give us a little bit more details? What kind of buy-ins do you have from Gulf states? Is it going to be one network with all the partners in there, or is it going to be a hub-and-spoke, returning to CENTCOM perhaps? And whether the latest decision by OPEC+ and the rising tensions between the U.S. and Saudi might complicate this effort.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im sorry, was this about integrated air and missile defense?\n\nQ Yes, in Israel.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Well, we still believe that thats and is an important capability that wed like to pursue. It was it was on the agenda when the President went to the Middle East in July. Its still on our agenda of things to explore. Central Command is working through through the modalities with our partners in the region. We still think its its an idea worth pursuing.\n\nQ Is there a timeline for this?\n\nMR. KIRBY: No. And there hasnt been. I mean, its not this is not the kind of thing that youre going to be able to slap together and just do in a couple of weeks. Integrated air and missile defense means netting together a series of sensors, as well as kinetic capabilities interceptors, missiles, and the launchers that put them up into the air netting all them together in a coordinated way so that everybody shares the benefit of the missile defense capabilities of your neighbor.\n\nAnd given the fact that Irans ballistic missile program continues to improve and grow, we still believe theres a lot of theres a lot of merit in that idea.\n\nQ Thank you, John. Just to follow up on the Iranian drones, is the U.S. considering additional sanctions over the supply of those drones to Russia in addition to what was announced today?\n\nMR. KIRBY: What weve the sanctions today were really about the way theyre treating protesters. You saw I think it was last week, I think we did issue some additional sanctions with respect to their provision of these drones to Russia. Were not taking additional sanctions off the table. I dont have anything to announce today, but clearly, if and when we do that, well make that public.\n\nQ And a follow-up on the nuclear talks. Youve said that its not the focus right now, but does a lack of urgency at this stage indicate that the administration has given up on the talks?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Well, Id push back a little bit on the \"lack of urgency.\" What I said is its not our focus right now. Our focus is on holding the Iranian regime accountable for how theyre treating their own people. And were just too far apart. I mean, Iran continues to make demands that have nothing to do with the nuclear deal that they want put in there. And we just arent there.\n\nAs I said in my opening comments, in the meeting that the President had with President Herzog, we reiterated that our commitment, the Presidents commitment to making sure Iran cannot achieve a nuclear weapon. Obviously, diplomacy is the still the preferred path to do that. Were just not in a position where thats a that thats a virab- viable option right now.\n\nSo, I disagree that theres that theres a lack of sense of urgency. We dont want them to achieve this capability. But right now, what were focused on is the way theyre treating their own people.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Sebastian. Go ahead, Sebastian. Go ahead.\n\nQ Thank you very much.\n\nQ Can I ask you a question about Wagner Group in Africa? A lot of officials the U.S. official have been warning that the Russian mercenaries are creating havoc in Mali. I want you to react. Is do you understand the void that they are there to fill?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Do I understand what?\n\nQ Do you understand the void thats been created for the Malian government to invite the Wagner Group into Mali?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont have a lot of insight into the Wagner Groups activities in Mali. So I can take the question for you, and we can see if we can get you an answer. I just dont have the insight on that issue.\n\nIll just say, broadly speaking, the Wagner Group is very active, of course, in Ukraine. We know that. Theyre most active in the Donbas region, that northeast section of Ukraine right now, and that they have and weve talked about this before I mean, they have been recruiting fighters from North Africa, from the Levant area to aid their efforts on the ground. Its a private military contractor, and theyre not above that kind of recruitment effort.\n\nBut as to what theyre doing in Mali, sir, I just dont have that for you.\n\nQ And is the State Department\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. Hold on a second. Lets be John is kind enough\n\nQ No, Im just asking a follow-up question.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I know, but were going to call get to everyone. Just hold on. You were not called on just yet.\n\nQ No, but its just a follow-up question.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Sebastian. Go ahead, Sebastian.\n\nQ Okay. Thank you. Can I just zoom out a bit on Ukraine? Because weve had a lot of nitty-gritty on the weapons systems and so on.\n\nZooming out I know youve had this question before, but I think its kind of a crucial one: The mantra is that the support for Ukraine will go on \"as long as it takes\" I think thats pretty much the wording. Obviously, \"forever,\" presumably, is nothing that anybody wants or could ever even plan for.\n\nSo does the administration have a clear view of whats going on now and whats being built up is going to end in a Russian withdrawal/defeat Ukraine victory? If not, what is the \"as long as it takes,\" where does it go?\n\nMR. KIRBY: If youre asking if we can predict the end of this war what its going to look like and when the answer, of course, is no. What I can all I can really tell you is what we see now. Okay? Neither side is in a position to sit down and negotiate.\n\nI just went through the whole litany of why, you know, Putin is clearly continuing to prosecute this war in a brutal, violent way. President Zelenskyy has said himself that theyre focused on their counteroffensive operations, that they are not in a position where they want to negotiate.\n\nOur job, our role here is to make sure that we continue to support Ukraine in the field so that if and when it comes to the table, President Zelenskyy is also able to succeed in his negotiations.\n\nHe gets to determine he gets to determine when that is. He gets to determine what success looks like. And he gets to determine what or what he is not willing to negotiate with the Russians. But were just not there yet.\n\nSo, our focus is on making sure hes got the tools and capabilities he needs to succeed on that battlefield, because that battlefield success will, no no question, have an impact on the \"if\" and the \"when\" and the scope of any negotiations going forward.\n\nAnd yes, weve said \"as long as it takes.\" Quite frankly, wed like for \"as long as it takes\" to be 4:20 today, right? It would be great if it ended now, but it aint. And and until it does, weve got to make sure that were that were postured to help Ukraine.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Im going to take as many as we can.\n\nQ Just to sort of follow up on kind of the conversations youve been having about Russia and Iran, is the assessment then that that relationship has grown closer since the invasion of Ukraine?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I think its hard to argue that it hasnt, at least from a tangible perspective. In terms of the transactional nature of this, its hard to argue that it hasnt grown closer.\n\nQ Thank you.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.\n\nQ Thank you, John. Two questions. First of all, regarding the, God forbid, deployment of a dirty bomb against Ukraine, Im sure the administration would hold Russia accountable, except Russia is not going to own up to it. Theyve been fighting this proxy war since 2014. Most of the attacks taking place in the Donbas, Russia was like, \"Hey, its got nothing to do with us.\" Same with the attack on the Nord Stream pipeline.\n\nIf we dont know who is behind the attack, how are we able to hold anybody accountable?\n\nMR. KIRBY: First of all, there hasnt been one. And and and we dont wa- and we dont want to see one.\n\nAll I can tell you I mean, this is a thats a very hypothetical question. All I can tell you is were monitoring this as best we can.\n\nWe know that the Ukrainians are not planning, are not thinking, are not are not preparing for the use of a dirty bomb. We know its a part of the Russian playbook again, as I said to Jeremy to blame others for that which youre going to do yourself, which is what gives us concern.\n\nWere going to watch this as best we can. I cant tell you with perfect specificity that should one get used, were going to were going to know the time and the place and the size and that were going to, you know, be able to have forensic evidence right on the on the on the ground about about where it came from. But were going to treat it seriously.\n\nAnd were obviously to the degree Russia needs to be held to account for that kind of activity, well do that.\n\nQ You just said Ukrainians are not preparing for that right now?\n\nMR. KIRBY: That is right.\n\nQ Okay.\n\nMy second question is: Have you has the administration been tracking the U.N.s inquiry into the U.N. commission inquiry into Israels little war with Gaza last year and the condemnation that went only against Israel, not against Hamas? And is that something youre prepared to comment on?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont have a comment for you on that today.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, Brian then Toluse. And John is is kind enough to stay a little bit longer. Were going to move the 4:30 backgrounder so folks (inaudible).\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. Thanks, John. Just to follow up the last week when we spoke the on Ukraine and the dirty bomb: We both know those things can be very hard to detect if its brought to the front. How confident are we that or how confident is the DOD, how confident are you that that that hasnt happened? And are there additional preparations to be made to ensure that it doesnt happen?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im confident that\n\nQ And then a follow-up.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im confident that were were monitoring this as best we can. And I say \"as best we can\" on purpose, because its not its not perfect.\n\nQ Its not (inaudible).\n\nMR. KIRBY: We dont we dont have perfect visibility into everything that that might be done or have to be done if one were going to actually use a dirty bomb. And just to make clear, its a conventional explosive device using radioactive materials to use the explosive device to spread that. And a lot of it would depend, you know, on on size and and how much preparation was was put into it if, in fact, it was used.\n\nSo, were watching this as best we can. And all I can tell you with confidence is we dont see any indications that theres preparations for use. We certainly know the Ukrainians arent going to go down that path. Weve seen nothing that would tell us that the Russians are, at this point, preparing to do that at this time.\n\nQ And then a quick follow-up to yesterdays withdrawal of the letter from well, progressives of the Democratic Party requesting a change in the status of our relationship with Ukraine. For our allies there have been reports that our allies are a little concerned about our commitment to Ukraine because of that statement. Can you just state categorically that the U.S. has not changed it and wont change its attitude? Or can you make that statement?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I can say not only have we not changed our approach to Ukraine, but we havent seen any diminution or any any concern expressed by our allies and partners either over over the press reporting on this letter.\n\nThese these Democrats, as you know, they pulled the letter back. Ill let them speak to to their decision-making.\n\nBut we have enjoyed and continue to enjoy terrific bipartisan support for our approach to Ukraine and the and the kinds of security assistance that were providing. And were going to need that support going forward. The President is not worried about that.\n\nQ Thank you.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. Toluse, and then well go to the back. Go ahead.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. Thanks, John. Im going to try to keep this to one question.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you. (Laughter.)\n\nQ Well see.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Is that a problem for him? (Laughter.)\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Actually, hes Toluse is (inaudible). (Laughter.)\n\nQ It may depend on your answer. Well see. (Laughter.)\n\nPresident Herzog said today that President Biden would be attending COP27 in Egypt. I was just wondering if you had any details on that trip and any information about what the President hopes to accomplish in Egypt?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont have any travel or schedule for the President to speak to today.\n\nQ Second question then. (Laughter.) On the on U.S.-Saudi relation review, you said theres no hurry, that this could take a while, the President can take his time to do this review correctly. Obviously, theres some things that have happened between the announcement of this review and today and, obviously, more things that could happen.\n\nYesterday, we heard about how it was noteworthy that Rus- that the Saudis had voted against Russia at the U.N. and have provided millions of dollars for Ukraine. Today, you said it wasnt so great that the Saudis were talking about whos mature and not mature in the relationship. You talked about the upcoming\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah, I dont think that was helpful dialogue, no.\n\nQ So my question is sort of: Are there things that the U.S. is looking for the Saudis to do between now and their completion of this review to shape the way and the direction of the review? Are there things that the Saudis could do to shape the direction of the ultimate outcome?\n\nMR. KIRBY: We havent we havent we havent given them, like, a to-do list. I mean, thats not the way a strategic partner acts with another partner, not at all.\n\nI think Karine did talk about the yesterday their their vote at the U.N. And they have contributed now theyve agreed to commit hundreds of millions of dollars to Ukraine. All that is welcome.\n\nAs I said to the question I got on Israel, these are national decisions and sovereign decisions, and we respect them all. And we certainly respect the ones that the Saudis have taken recently.\n\nBut but, no, were not its not like we have a laundry list of things that they that they have to do or that were asking them to do.\n\nI want to go back to what I said before, at the risk of of sounding redundant: It is a strategic partnership, and it has been for 80 years. And nobody is talking about rupturing it. We we you know, its an important partnership that that bears fruit in the region on many different levels counterterrorism, climate change. I mean, theres a lot there.\n\nBut we believe that that in light of the decision, you know, that that we want to make sure this relationship, going forward, is obviously serving that the national interests of the American people as best they can, and well get there.\n\nAnd as I said earlier, its not going to be rushed. Its not going to be done in a in a careless way. Well look at this very, very deliberately over time and in consultation with with members of Congress.\n\nBut, no, theres not a you know, theres not a theres not a list.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Just three more, and then well let John go.\n\nQ Thank you, Karine. So Ive got a question about Saudi Arabia and a question about China.\n\nOn Saudi Arabia: A U.S. citizen, Saad Almadi, whos imprisoned for a series of tweets he sent his son told me that President Biden, quote, \"sold my father for oil by prioritizing gas prices over his release.\" Do you have a response to that?\n\nAnd on China, this is a very simple question but its an enduring point of uncertainty: Does the Presidents son still co-own a company with Chinas government? And if not, can you provide some basic transparency about who bought that stake and how much money?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont have any for you on your second question. But let me let me address your first.\n\nFirst of all, we understand the angst that the family is going through. We appreciate that. We respect that. And we know that theyd love nothing more than than to have him back. I think this was the son who said this his father.\n\nWe know and, you know, again, respect the pain and the anguish that theyre going through. And we never lose sight of the of the pain that families are feeling here back home or the trials and tribulations of people that are wrong- wrongfully detained elsewhere around the world. Its something were constantly focusing on.\n\nSo, I would just say to that family: Again, we respect and understand and sympathize with the anguish. We continue to work on these cases all around the world, as much as we can.\n\nQ Is he wrongfully detained? And can we expect President Biden to directly address this case?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont have a I would refer you to the State Department for the characterization of this particular case.\n\nBut its not just wrongfully detained Ameri- were concerned about all Americans that you know, that are held overseas against their will, whether its technically \"wrongfully detained\" or not. Im not going to get into this specific case.\n\nI would just say to to the quote that you read for this individual, we again, we appreciate and respect the anguish that the family is going through. Its never far from our minds. And, you know, well work as hard as we can to get these cases resolved.\n\nQ Is the President going to be publicly mentioning this? He, of course, did not mention it publicly when he went to Saudi Arabia in July.\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont I mean, he did bring up issues of of human rights. It was like the first thing that he brought up in the bilateral discussion. I wont get beyond that in terms of talking about specific cases.\n\nBut I dont have any additional, official statements by the President to announce or speak to right now.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, Steven, weve got to go.\n\nQ Thank you, Karine.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No (laughs) in the yes.\n\nQ Which one?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: The young man next to you.\n\nQ Thank you. President Biden just met with the Israeli President. I have a question on the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. The U.S. security coordinators report was not an investigation that was based on the Israeli investigation, the PAs investigation. There was a ballistics analysis done that was inconclusive. None of the key eyewitnesses have even been interviewed. Why has the U.S. not conducted an independent investigation into the killing of an American citizen?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Weve said from the very beginning that we wanted it her death fully, completely, transparently investigated. And and, you know, you saw that the Israeli government came out and acknowledged that that she was killed from a shot fired from an Israeli Defense Force position. And that, in their investigation, it wasnt you know, it wasnt a specific targeting of of a journalist.\n\nSo, we also, you know, have been in touch with the with the Palestinians about this as well.\n\nBut we we said from the very beginning that we wanted it fully and transparently investigated. We recognize that the Israelis did conduct a thorough investigation, and they made it and they made it public,\n\nQ Did you characterize it as a \"thorough investigation\" when no eyewitnesses no key eyewitnesses have been interviewed? And theres clear video evidence that contradicts the central claim in the killing of a U.S. citizen.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Again, we continue to mourn with the family. And this obviously should not have happened. But Im not going to speak any more about the investigation thats been completed.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Last question. Go ahead.\n\nQ Thanks. Thanks, Karine. Thanks, John. So, on the review the Saudi relationship review, it partly is because we were told that it helps Russia the production cut helps Russia. Why is the same result or why is the same review not happening with China, which has helped buy more Russian oil 50 percent more and helping prop up the Russian economy?\n\nMR. KIRBY: We have been very public about our concerns over people purchasing Russian oil. And weve called the Chinese out for this as a major consumer of Russian oil, because it does help keep the price higher than than what we what we want.\n\nWhat weve done to counteract that I mean, youre talking about a specific tactical decision by OPEC+ to make a cut, which we had analysis that showed that wasnt the best thing to do for the market at that time and that we did believe benefited Russia.\n\nWe have been no less transparent or candid about talking about our concerns over Chinese purchases of Russian oil on the market, which also helps keep you know, keep that price up, which is why we are working with our European partners to try to get a price cap in place for the oil Russian oil on the market so that Mr. Putin cant profiteer off it anymore.\n\nQ But is there a review of the relationship between the U.S. and China?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im not theres no I dont have an announcement of a review of the relationship. These are literally apples to oranges youre asking us to compare here.\n\nWe have I mean, take a look at the National Security Strategy, which we just released a couple of weeks ago. It makes it pretty clear how we feel about the bilateral relationship with China. Its a strategic competition a competition that the President believes the United States can win and there are also present specific threats and challenges in the Indo-Pacific region that we have to make sure that were that were ready for.\n\nAnd were not bashful about talking about this very complex relationship with China. There are things that we believe we can and should cooperate with them on. Climate change is a good one. And theyre the ones that pulled back the bilateral discussions that we were having at a working level on climate. Theyre the ones that pulled back on some of the military, bilateral, working level conferences and and forums that that we had.\n\nSo, theres tension in this relationship. We believe we can manage that tension. We believe we can succeed in this strategic competition. And again, I would point you to the National Security Strategy, which I think lays it out perfectly clear how we look at this bilateral relationship and, with or without a review, how were going to manage that relationship going forward.\n\nThanks, everybody. Appreciate it.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thanks, John.\n\nAll right. Thanks, John, for your time. Appreciate you.\n\nOkay. We have about 15 minutes. So, Zeke, do you want to kick us off?\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. Did the President watch last nights Senate debate in Pennsylvania?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I knew you were going to ask that question. (Laughter.) So, I actually tried to get an answer for you. I went to the Oval, but the President has had a very busy morning, as you all know, with the Israeli president hes hosting, whos in town. And so, I was not able to get an answer on that if he was able to watch the debate last night.\n\nBut I do want to be careful Im not going to get into political matters from here.\n\nQ I just asked you a question on the debate\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, I know. I I always preface that because I just want to be safe here. We do care about the rule of law here. But so, just want to say that.\n\nBut I will say this: You know, the President looks forward to working with the lieutenant governor when he is when he is in the Senate. And so, we to continue to lower costs and continue to deliver for the middle-class family.\n\nI could say also that, you know, in his conversations that hes had with Lieutenant Governor Fetterman, he finds the lieutenant governor to be a strong and authentic advocate for the middle class. And, as you know, he has traveled many times to Pennsylvania and theyve had events together. And hes looking forward, again, to work to continue to work with him.\n\nQ A separate question. We know, Friday, the President plans to be with Lieutenant Governor Fetterman in Pennsylvania. Its also the first day of early voting in Delaware. The last time there was an election in Delaware, the President had to take a last-minute trip up there to vote in the primary at significant taxpayer expense. Does he plan to vote early or on Election Day?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, the President, as you as you know, believes that, you know, peoples right to vote is incredibly important and he clearly exercises that right. And I dont have anything to preview on his schedule about when hes going to be voting. And as when that happens, we certainly will you will all know. But I dont have anything to share on the timing of when hes going to vote. He certainly will vote. I just dont have a timing on when.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Just a really quick follow-up to Zekes question. Given the amount of time that the President has spent with Fetterman and the conversation that is happening today in the wake of last nights debate performance, does the President have any concerns about has he ever raised, either in conversations with you that youve been a part of or with others here at the White House, any concerns about his health?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, Ill say this: With in personal conversations that the President has had with the lieutenant governor, the President has found him to be impressive an incredibly bright and talented person whos just as capable as always to carry out his office the duties of his office as we know, he is lieutenant governor currently and has great ability and heartfelt concern for the people of the Commonwealth.\n\nAnd that is what the President has observed himself. That is, you know, as is the case before and is the case today. And he respects the courage and the honesty that he sees from the lieutenant governor that hes experienced in their conversation, in their relationship over time.\n\nAnd we have we have, of course, as it relates to your question about his health, seen the same comments from independent medical experts that you all have noted and that the improving symptoms he has had to do with the speech and hearing not all with cognitive function.\n\nHe looks forward to working with the lieutenant governor in the future and and sees him as an authentic individual who is fighting every day for the middle class, and finds him incredibly impressive.\n\nQ Given the President, last week in Pittsburgh when we were traveling with him, said that he did think Democrats would be able to hold the Senate, does he still think that today given last nights debate performance?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, Im not going to get into analysis here. There are people out there who are who are political pundits who are clearly doing that every day for the next next two weeks, or less than two weeks. So, Im not going to get into get into those specifics.\n\nHeres what the President believes: He believes that the American people have a choice. Theres so much at stake for for our country. And he believes that the choice is very, very clear. He believes that Democrats and congressional Democrats and the President have a lot to speak to.\n\nAnd youve seen that across the past several several weeks from this President. Hes talked about student loan. Hes talked about economic recovery. Hes talked about, today even, the junk fees and what his administration is doing to make sure that we give a little bit breathing room for the American people. Hes talked about lowering costs. We see gas prices, as Kirby was saying, has come down about $1.25 a gallon because of the work that this President has done.\n\nSo he believes and lets not forget the Inflation Reduction Act that only Democrats voted on, and thats going to lower healthcare costs, thats going to really put put in a great effort in fighting climate climate change and also lower energy costs.\n\nSo, for him, he believes and also congressional Democrats, because you hear them talking about it as well in their districts and states have a lot that they have delivered for the American people. And thats going to be his focus these next couple of weeks, as its been these past several months.\n\nQ Just one more question. Given you know, polls show that voters at this point the primary concern heading into the midterms is inflation and the economy. By a 2-to-1 margin, voters trust Republicans more than Democrats to handle the economy. I wonder, given this sort of majority sentiment of voters, is the President considering making any changes to his economic team after the midterms?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No. Go ahead, Steve.\n\nQ Karine, today the rank and file in the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen voted 61 percent against the tentative agreement that was brokered by the administration to stave off the railroad work stoppage. Whats the White Houses reaction to that? And are you concerned that a strike is ahead?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, a couple of things. I we I do want to give a little bit of a laydown of what we think here. The unions that have not ratified and the railroad employers have agreed to a cooling-off period that extends well into November, giving them adequate time to continue their work and ensuring that our economy is under no immediate threat.\n\nThe President remains focused on protecting American America Americas families, farms, and businesses by avoiding a rail shutdown. That is our priority, of course, when it comes to these discussions. Both sides have said they share that desire as well.\n\nAs the President has said for months, any shutdown would be completely unacceptable. It is the responsibility of the parties involved to resolve this issue. And that and any idea that kicking this to Congress will result in a quick or favorable outcome is just deeply misguided. That is our view from here.\n\nThese unions rejection of the current proposed contract does not mean we face an immediate rail shutdown. Thats not how we view it. But it does mean that the union and the employers have additional work to do. Unions are democratic organizations, as you all know.\n\nWe stand ready, as we did earlier this year, to support the parties in their efforts. We continue to urge both sides to work in good faith and avoid even the threat of a shutdown. We remain laser-focused, as before, on taking any appropriate steps to ensure that Americas rail system keeps moving so our families dont dont have to suffer from this.\n\nQ Just a real quick follow-up. This is now the second union to reje- have the rank and file reject a tentative agreement. Is the President himself going to get more directly involved in this?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, the administration is in regular contact. Dont have anything to share about the Presidents involvement specifically with the parties. Our administration are in regular contact with the parties who are dealing with this matter, of course. And we stand ready. We stand ready, like we did not too long ago earlier this year, as I just mentioned to support the parties in their efforts.\n\nWe continue to urge, again, both both sides, as we did during that time as well, to really operate in good faith.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ The President has frequently talked about transparency and so has this administration. Does the President believe that Fetterman should release his medical records?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Ive been asked this question, and I leave that over to the lieutenant governor to make that decision.\n\nQ One more on Fetterman. Im just curious if the President feels that the lieutenant governors decision to participate in that debate was an important moment in terms of welcoming people who have disabilities into the public sphere and whether that was important symbolically.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, the President, as I said, is very impressive [sic] by his courage and that he sees from the lieutenant governor. Im not going to get into any analysis of if he should have or should have not.\n\nBut, clearly, you know, when you are in those positions, when you are a lieutenant governor, you are also a leader and on many levels. And and so, again, you know, we are impressed by his courage. We are impressed by what hes been able to accomplish these past several months. And, you know, the President will will continue to work with him down the road.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. I wanted to ask you about Leader McCarthys comments that a Republican majority would not write a blank check as it relates to Ukraine aid. My colleagues are reporting that McCarthy has been reassuring Republican lawmakers that his comments about Ukraine aid that he wasnt planning to abandon Ukraine aid and that he was simply calling for more oversight of federal dollars.\n\nIm wondering if the administration accepts that interpretation or if you have any comment on it, and also whether McCarthy or his office have reached out or if youve had any conversation with them about the future of Ukraine aid any potential.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So Im just going to repeat what the President said when he was asked this question, because I think he he touched to the question that youre asking me.\n\nYou know, he said he understands why people have concerns; the cost to support Ukraine is great. But also, we have to understand that that that because of our support for Ukraine, it is a lot bigger than just Ukraine, right?\n\nWere talking about a democracy. Were talking about Ukrainians who are fighting for their freedom. Were talking about an unprovoked war that was started by President Putin. And and and, you know, the and we all understand that; our partners, our allies understand that; and congressional members understand that too. Because, remember, this the support that we have seen has indeed been bipartisan.\n\nAnd just to continue what the President had said, he said its about supporting NATO and all of Europe. Its about making sure that Putin is not able to succeed through his brutal actions. And our support for Ukraine will remain strong until the end of this war.\n\nSo we are committed to supporting Ukraine during this time, and we are impressed by their bravery. And were going to do everything that we can to continue to give them that assistance.\n\nQ Just given the significant possibility that Republicans will retake a majority in the House, have there not been any conversations between the White House and Leader McCarthys office about the future of Ukraine aid in the wake of those comments?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So Ill say this I dont want to get too much into hypotheticals from here, but Ill say that we have kept that line of communication open throughout these past several months with congressional members. Remember, this is a bipartisan effort, and we appreciate the bipartisan effort. And thats what we will continue to work towards.\n\nGo ahead, Kelly O.\n\nQ Was the White House in any way surprised by the performance of the lieutenant governor in the debate? I know that people here including not just the President, but others have been in touch with him. But was there any surprise, in terms of how he performed, given the auditory processing, given the high profile of the evening, and that sort of thing? Was it a surprise to the White House at all?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, its its been a busy day, as you know; you guys have been watching the President. He gave a speech on junk fees, which is going to be incredibly important to the American people, ser- saving American people $24 billion. So that was something that he was certainly focused on. The Israeli President is here, who hes hosting, as you all know.\n\nSo its not a conversation that we are we are currently having here internally.\n\nBut I will remind you that the President was just with the lieutenant governor just last week I think a week from today when we were in Pittsburgh and the President talked about the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, how it was able to really help to rebuild the Fern Hollow Bridge as you remember, back in January, fell, really just collapsed, and thank goodness no one was severely hurt. And because of the work that this President has done, were able to build rebuild that that bridge in a years time. And so or, just under a year, to be exact. So thats kind of our focus.\n\nOur focus is how were going to continue to do the work that we have been doing for the past several months. Again, the President, in his personal conversations with lieutenant governor, he finds him to be an authentic, really brave individual.\n\nQ And in those conversations, did he need to have any additional captioning service or anything like that to help facilitate that conversation with the President?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, you guys I mean, you guys saw him. I think some of your colleagues were there when we went to Philadelphia, to the to the fundraiser. And so your colleagues were there, and so they can speak to that themselves.\n\nAnd so, you know, Im not going to Im not going to get into what he shouldnt do, not do medical. Thats not my place to do; that is for the lieutenant governor to answer on his on his own, for himself.\n\nBut again, the President looks forward to working with him down the road.\n\nI havent called on you.\n\nQ On student loans, I was wondering, is the White House making any preparations for the possibility that the Court of Appeals could block President Bidens student student loan debt forgiveness?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, right now, as you know Ive talked about this a few times, when you see when we look at what has occurred with the court. It is a temporary court order, as you all know, and Ive talked about this earlier. The Eighth Circuits temporary order does not prevent borrowers from applying for student student debt relief at Student- StudentAid.gov. So people should go there: StudentAid.gov, again. And we encourage eligible borrowers to join the millions of Americans who have already applied.\n\nBut the the order doesnt prevent the Department of Education from reviewing these applications and preparing them for transmission to loan services.\n\nIt is also important to note that the order does not reverse lower courts dismissal of the case or suggest that the case has merit at all.\n\nSo, it merely prevents debt from being discharged until the court makes a decision, so we will continue to move full speed ahead. We understand how important the Presidents policy is, because we again, its going to give families a little bit of breathing room. And lets not forget, its going to help 90 percent of the borrowers that its going to help are going to folks who make less than $75,000.\n\nSo were going to move full speed ahead in the process getting prepared. Again, its a its a temporary order.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thanks. Id like to follow up on something you were asked Monday about presidential press conferences. Its been since January since the President has held a press conference here at the White House. Is this administration at all concerned that the scarcity of press conferences by this President has in any way led to some of the misinformation that has been out in the public? And can we please get him in here?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, I understand the question. You guys have to ask the question about press conferences. Duly noted. And so, we, again, appreciate the question.\n\nBut the the President took questions he literally took questions while he was getting a needle in his arm yesterday and getting the new vaccine. So, he certainly he certainly takes questions from all of you. And and he he he does it often. I understand of having a a more, you know you know, a more more\n\nQ A more robust discussion.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I mean, look, the President is happy to take questions. He does it pretty regularly. I duly noted on the press conference.\n\nBut, again, this is a President who has has not has not shied away from taking questions from from all of you. And so, I think youll con- hell continue to do that. Almost every day, hell continue to make sure that Im sure, on his own, will continue to take your questions.\n\nQ Well, just let him know wed love to see him in here someday.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Laughs.) Okay. But, again, Im not going to get ahead of of him, of where we are with with the process.\n\nBut, again, the President takes questions from all of you almost almost every day.\n\nGo ahead, Jacqui.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. You had just said that there are no plans to adjust the economic team after the midterms. So I just want to ask and a follow-up can the administration then say when Americans can expect to feel relief from inflation? Is there a date they can look to?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I will let the experts speak to that. Im not going to get into into what when when thats going to occur. Right? But we have seen some relief over the past several months. We understand there is theres more work to be done.\n\nBut, look, the President has been laser-focused on doing the work every day to lower costs for the American families because he understands what inflation is doing to American workers, American families. And so, hes going to do that that work.\n\nWe talk I just talked about gas prices. Has that has that that has gone down about $1.25 a gallon for the past several days. Its going to continue to go down. That is saving American families about 130 bucks per month; that matters.\n\nI last week, we talked about hearing aids. Thats going to how were lowering costs. Costs hearing aids cost about $3,000 a pair. What the President did last week is going to hurt [sic] to help, pardon me, tens of millions of Americans, and that matters.\n\nWere going to the junk fees going to give Americans a little bit more breathing room.\n\nSo, look, we understand that theres more work to do. We understand that families are being squeezed by whats happening currently with inflation. But, again, we have seen some moderation. I believe well continue to see that. Dont want to get too much into into the economists world.\n\nBut but because of the Presidents economic policies, we we have made sure, the President has made sure that we dont leave anybody behind, that we have a strong labor market, that unemployment is at the lowest that its been in 50 years. And that matters. And we should talk about that as well as well as acknowledging what American families are going through.\n\nIm just going to\n\nQ Thank you, Karine.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. All right, guys. Thanks, everybody.\n\nQ Thank you.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you.\n\n4:55 P.M. EDT",

                "cc_text": "MS COLLINS: Secretary, so just this morning, Putin is overseeing some annual nuclear drills with Russian forces. How concerned are you that Russia could use a dirty bomb and blame it on Ukraine blame it on Ukraine?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Were concerned about two things. Were of course concerned about the rhetoric weve heard from Putin and from other Russian officials going back some weeks now over the possible use of a nuclear weapon. Were watching that very carefully. We havent seen reason to change our own nuclear posture, but its something that were tracking very carefully, and weve also communicated directly and very clearly to the Russians, to President Putin, about the consequences that would flow from any use of a nuclear device.\n\nSeparate and apart from that, weve seen these allegations coming from the Russians that somehow the Ukrainians are looking or contemplating using a so-called dirty bomb, which is an utter fabrication and something that is also the height of irresponsibility coming from a nuclear power. In fact, the IAEA is now, at Ukraines invitation, in Ukraine visiting as theyve done in the past the nuclear facilities that Ukraine has.\n\nThe reason this particular allegation gives us some concern is because Russia has a track record of projecting, which is to say accusing others of doing something that they themselves have done or are thinking about doing. But there, again, weve communicated very clearly and very directly to the Russians about trying to use this false allegation as a pretext for any kind of escalation on Russias behalf.\n\nMS COLLINS: And just to hold on that for a second, what would be our response if Russia does do something like that in terms of a mirroring event?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, Im not going to get into speaking publicly to what we and others will do, other than to say that weve communicated that clearly and very directly to the Russians, including President Putin.\n\nMS COLLINS: So staying on Ukraine for a minute, a little longer, on terms of more broadly, were heading into the midterm elections. We are hearing some concerns grow louder about support for Ukraine, the cost of it. What assurances are you giving to Ukraine and our allies that we are going to stay supportive for the months ahead?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: What weve seen to date is a remarkable bipartisan consensus and bipartisan support for Ukraine, for putting pressure on Russia to cease its aggression, for taking the steps necessary at NATO to shore up our own defensive alliance. I visited Ukraine, I visited neighboring countries with bipartisan delegations from Congress from both the House and the Senate, and that consensus that strong core I think remains strong and will remain so going forward.\n\nIts vitally important because its in the national interest. Yes, of course, theres deep concern about the horrific destruction thats been done to Ukraine, the brutalization of the Ukrainian people, and that, I think, touches Americans across the board, irrespective of whether theyre Republicans or Democrats, members of Congress or citizens. But we also know that this is an aggression against the very principles that are at the heart of the international system necessary for keeping peace and security, principles that grew out of the experience of two world wars and a conviction that we have to find ways to make sure that those couldnt be repeated. And so there was an agreement that you cant simply go in and seize territory from another country, that you cant change the borders of another country by force, that you cant try to erase its independence and sovereignty from the map. And if we allow that to go unchecked, if we allow that to proceed with impunity, it opens a Pandoras box around the world for would-be aggressors. Thats going to create conflict, and we know from history that draws us in.\n\nI think in my conversations with members of Congress Republicans, Democrats, House, Senate theres a shared conviction that this is important, its necessary, and were sticking with Ukraine.\n\nMS COLLINS: So you were just referencing history a couple times there, and I know you have written about, studied, worked on foreign policy related to that intersection of the U.S., Europe, Russia, particularly around energy, for a long time, even writing a book, \"Ally Versus Ally,\" on it in the 1980s. So if you fast-forward to today, what is your view on whether Europe has finally learned its lesson on energy dependence with its neighbor?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: What weve seen over the last nine or so months since the Russian aggression began is remarkable in terms of actually moving Europe away from this dependence on Russian energy thats built up over decades. Europe in general, leading countries in particular, have done more over the space of nine months to break that dependence than anything weve seen in years. And we see that in the already dramatically reduced dependence on Russian gas in particular, on Russian oil, and thats vitally important and its going to have a profound strategic impact going forward over the coming years and decades.\n\nBut like any transition, especially a transition from something thats built up over so many years, its challenging, its not without difficulty, its not without pain, and the Europeans are facing that square on. Were working to do everything we possibly can to help, especially to get through this coming winter and the winter beyond. As you know, ever since the Russian aggression and even going back before that, weve been working, first of all, to make sure that theres enough energy on world markets to meet demand. Weve worked very closely with Europe in particular in the short term to make sure that it could get a surge of LNG supplies liquefied natural gas to them to make up for what they were losing from Russia. Weve worked with partners and allies in Asia to divert supplies of LNG that were going to them to Europe. Weve increased our own production of oil and gas to actually to record levels. And, of course, the President has drawn down from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in part to keep prices in check.\n\nOne of the things thats happening in Europe now is because of the very important moves that they made, including to try to decrease demand during this critical period, to pursue the transition away from Russian energy, and to take other steps, the supply that they have on hand going into the winter will probably be whats necessary to keep things going and to keep people warm and comfortable. However, the impact on price is whats the immediate concern, because that has the potential to make it harder for industry to get the energy it needs to keep producing things. That has economic impacts, et cetera.\n\nSo one of the things that were working on and its something, of course, that affects our own citizens is not only making sure that the supply is there but making sure to the best of our ability that prices are kept in check. And this is in a moment, of course, of global inflation. So all of that are things were working on. Were also working on the longer term with the Europeans. We established a task force with the European Union to work on this longer-term transition.\n\nLast thing Ill say is it only accentuates the need as Europe is moving away from dependence on Russian energy to also pursue this energy transition to renewables. That too takes time, but it only, I think, emphasizes the imperative of doing that not only in terms of dealing with climate but also in terms of dealing with dependency on fossil fuels particularly coming from specific countries like Russia.\n\nMS COLLINS: So you just hit on a number of things there that we cover so closely here at Bloomberg: energy markets, inflation, both in the global economy and certainly in the U.S. right now. And its also making me think of Saudi Arabia in terms of the relations there they seem to be at the lowest that theyve been in a really long time. What can you possibly do to potentially recalibrate that relationship? Are you preparing to try and do something like that and re-engage the crown prince at the G20 coming up, for example?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: The first thing to note is this: This is a relationship that has been built over many decades, over many administrations, different leaderships in Saudi Arabia. Its been built up on a bipartisan basis, taking into account a multiplicity of interests that the United States has in that relationship and in dealing in that partnership. And as were looking at where were going, were going to do it in a very deliberative fashion in consultation with members of Congress, as the President has said, to make sure of this: that the relationship better reflects our own interests. So were looking at how to most effectively do that.\n\nSince the decision by OPEC+, which we have not been not been shy about making it very clear how the extent to which we view that as a wrong decision and one that does nothing actually to advance our interests, on the contrary, the potential of oil prices to go up to further line Putins pockets at a time when hes doing this aggression, to have the prices rise, if they were to rise, at a time when the world economy is trying to recover from COVID as well as dealing with global inflation. So weve been very clear that this was the wrong decision, and also the wrong decision in terms of OPEC+ itself and Saudi Arabia because there is nothing to suggest in the analysis that we have and that we share with the Saudis that were looking at prices plummeting in ways that would be problematic for them.\n\nBut having said that, since the decision weve seen a few interesting things. The Saudis supported the important resolutions at the United Nations condemning Russias aggression, particularly the resolution that went forward at the General Assembly condemning the purported annexations of Ukrainian territory. Weve also seen the Saudis come forward with about $400 million in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine. So these are positive developments. They dont compensate the decision made by OPEC+ on production, but we take note of that.\n\nThe other thing Id say is this: Right now we have actually not seen prices go up because weve taken steps, the Presidents taken steps, including further release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, additional steps on our own production that are keeping prices in check. In fact theyve actually gone down a little. And of course the actual production cut has not gone into effect. It was just an announcement of the decision. We havent yet seen the productions cuts go into effect itself.\n\nMS COLLINS: How much of a risk, though, do you see if energy markets in Europe really do tighten out tighten up we see some blackouts, or even we see in places like the Northeast in the U.S. start to struggle in terms of access to energy this winter? How destabilizing could that be in terms of our support for the war in Ukraine or just the global economy?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Look, my own assessment is this, and Im not Im not the leading expert on this, so maybe Secretary Granholm can come by, and others. But based on the steps that the Europeans have taken over the last six or seven months, and particularly over the last few months, including this summer, theyve done a number of things that are very significant that I think will help keep things in the right place through the course of this winter.\n\nOne is to make sure that their own reserves were as full as they possibly could be, so theyve done a very good job of doing that. But two is to take very significant steps to decrease demand, and thats making a difference. And three, of course, is the work, as I that I alluded to, that weve done to make sure that we could help surge to them supplies of energy that would compensate for many losses that theyre getting as a result of moving away from Russian oil and gas. And so again on the LNG, weve surged that. Weve diverted supplies that were going to Asia, weve increased our own production. All of this together, I think, is having a very is having a positive impact and look, well see how things go in the coming months. There are things we cant control, like the weather. So well see what the winter is like.\n\nBut my own assessment is that the Europeans have taken very important steps to make sure that they can get through winter in good shape.\n\nMS COLLINS: So lets turn to U.S.-China relations. Last week you made some comments related to thinking that China wants to seize Taiwan on a, as you said, much faster timeline. What are you seeing that made you think that this is speeding up?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: What we see is this, and it goes back a few years, not a few months. And actually let me go back take a step back even further. One of the hallmarks in the relationship going back some 50 years was the way that we handled the issues surrounding Taiwan, and in particular there was a fundamental understanding in the relationship between Beijing and Washington that differences over Taiwan between Beijing and Taiwan were to be managed peacefully, that there would be no unilateral changes to the status quo, and that fundamentally our interest was in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. That was the basic understanding, and that understanding held for decades and I think it was very successful in doing a few things. It allowed Taiwan itself to flourish and its people to flourish. It also made sure or helped to make sure that there wouldnt be conflict between the United States and China over Taiwan.\n\nWhats changed is this: the decision by the government in Beijing that that status quo is no longer acceptable, that they wanted to speed up the process by which they would pursue reunification. And they also, I think, have made decisions about how they would do that, including exerting more pressure on Taiwan, coercion, making life difficult in a variety of ways on Taiwan in the hopes that that would speed reunification, but also holding out the possibility if that didnt work of using force to achieve their goals. That is what has fundamentally changed, and weve seen that manifested in actions that China has taken, including with various military maneuvers in the Taiwan Strait, the deployment of forces, et cetera.\n\nNow, as we see it, this is first and foremost an effort, as I said, to turn up pressure on Taiwan. And as to what Beijing might do and when it might do it, I cant be any more precise than that. But the fundamental change has been this change in Chinas view that the status quo is unacceptable. This should be a concern for not just the United States but for countries not only in the region but around the world. Why? Because if theres any crisis regarding Taiwan, weve got 50 percent of container ships on a daily basis traveling through the Taiwan Straits. The implications of a crisis if that were disrupted for the world economy, supply chains are significant more than significant. Semiconductors, chips as everyone knows by now, the 90 percent of the sophisticated chips are produced in Taiwan. If that were for any reason disrupted, it would have deeply significant consequences for the global economy. The chips that are in our cell phones, our dishwashers, our automobiles, if thats disrupted if thats taken out of the supply chain, everyone has a big problem.\n\nSo everyone has a very big interest, I think, in making very clear to all involved, starting with Beijing, that the world does not want to see any kind of crisis regarding Taiwan, any kind of disruption, and the world believes that these differences need to be resolved peacefully and with peace and stability certainly in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nMS COLLINS: So you were just explaining that change that youre seeing in Chinas approach and the status quo. From our point of view, did that then mean that the era from the U.S.s approach of strategic ambiguity is that era over?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I think whats very important to recognize from the get-go is the relationship as a whole with China first of all is among the most, if not the most, consequential that we have. Its among the most complicated about the most complicated that we have. And it also cant be reduced to a bumper sticker. We clearly have a competition. And in part its a competition to shape what the world looks like going forward. Were weve really reached an inflection point an inflection point because the post-Cold War era is over; there is a competition on to shape what comes next. China and the United States are two of the biggest players in that. And we just have different visions of what the world should look like going forward. I think China wants a world order, but theirs would be an illiberal one. We want a world order, but ours would be inspired by liberal values.\n\nSo theres a fundamental difference, and were in a competition about that. Were not shy about it; neither is Beijing. But we also continue to have and I think the world expects us to have cooperation on big issues that are affecting the lives of not just Chinese and not just Americans but people around the world on things like climate and global health. And so where our interests continue to align, well continue to look for ways to cooperate. And then to the extent that the aspects of the relationship are adversarial, well firmly stand up and stand up strongly for our interests.\n\nWe dont look for conflicts. We dont want a Cold War. Were not trying to contain or restrain China. But equally, were resolute in standing up for our interests, standing up for our values, and again when it comes to Taiwan, standing up for the proposition thats held for decades that these differences need to be managed and resolved peacefully. There cannot and should not be unilateral changes to the status quo, particularly by force, and that we have an abiding interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Thats it. That is a strong, basic interest of the United States, and one that were determined to uphold.\n\nMS COLLINS: So you were just talking about that competition between us but also that the relationship is complicated. So when you saw this weekend Xi Jinping win another term as leader of China and also surrounding himself by even more loyalists, concentrating power even more, does that make your foreign policy approach with China more complicated or in some ways easier because you know exactly who youre dealing with?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: First, you have to start with, I think, a basic proposition that what we can do with our foreign policy and by the way, with our domestic policy, which Ill come to in a second is to help shape the environment outside of China in which China makes decisions. Were not going to be doing anything to shape the internal. These are decisions that China will make and that we cant make, but we can shape the external environment in which China is acting and making decisions about its policies in the world. Thats one thing.\n\nOne of the most effective ways that we can do that is exactly what weve been doing over the last couple of years. First, making the necessary investments in ourselves so that as were competing with China, as were looking to shape the international environment for what comes next, that we do it with the strongest possible hand. We just had an almost historic, I would say historic success with the CHIPS and Science Act, making massive investments in our own ability to retain the technological edge when it comes to chips and semiconductors, and not just in their production and making sure that were producing more here but also investments in the basic science and research and development thatll preserve that technological edge. Similarly, the Inflation Reduction Act has historic investments in our ability to deal with climate change, in particular by making sure that were developing the technologies here in the United States to do that. So these investments make a huge difference, and the investments that were making across the board in infrastructure, in education, as well as in research and development, that goes to our fundamental strength in technology, which in turn goes to our standing and strength around the world.\n\nBut the second piece is this, and this is so vital. One of the first instructions that I got from President Biden in taking this job was to invest, unfortunately, every single minute of the day in revitalizing, rejuvenating, re-energizing our alliances and our partnerships, and, as necessary, creating new alliances with countries that were fit for purpose on any given big issue. And thats exactly what weve done. But a big part of that goes to the competition with China. When we have greater alignment with our countries whether its in Europe, whether its in Asia, whether its in every other part of the world then our ability to deal with competition effectively is enhanced, is strengthened.\n\nFor example, when we see practices that China is engaged in economically that are fundamentally unfair to our workers and to our businesses and we want to see changes, were dealing with those issues on our own were 20, 25 percent of world GDP; significant to say the least but when were dealing together with Europe, with the European Union, with partners in Asia, we might be 50 or 60 percent of world GDP. Thats a lot harder for China to ignore. So this alignment with others with Europe, with Asia, with other countries around the world on issues where we have a difference in interests with China, thats a powerful part of what were able to do to shape the choices that China makes.\n\nMS COLLINS: Great. I want to turn to Q&A in just one minute, but when you look ahead to the next year, Secretary, what are you most focused on in terms of at the department and moving forward?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, a few things. As I said, the whats fundamentally motivating us is this strongly held view that we really are at an inflection point, that this is a moment when the post-Cold War era is clearly over, and there is this competition to shape what comes next thats on. And so making sure that we have the tools that we need to be doing as much of that shaping as possible is front and center to what Im thinking about. And as I said, that goes to many things were doing at home, in terms of the investments were making in ourselves. For my partnerships, what Im responsible for, its in building the strongest possible partnerships, creating the greatest possible alignment with other countries, likeminded countries of one kind or another, democracies, but also countries that may not fit neatly into the democratic camp but have a strong interest in having a world order thats actually shaped by rules that everyone plays by. Were working together with many countries to achieve that.\n\nAnd then within that, as were thinking about that and working on that, we also want to make sure that Putins aggression in Ukraine remains a strategic defeat for Russia, that we continue to pursue alignment with other countries in dealing with competition with China, and that were finding new and ever more effective ways to deal with a multiplicity of interconnected global challenges that are the things that are really affecting the lives of people in the United States, but also people around the world. And thats global health; thats climate; thats food insecurity; that is inclusive economic growth. All of these things, which in the years past were not necessarily front and center of what the State Department focused on, they now are. They have to be because more than anything else, theyre affecting the lives of citizens in all of our countries.\n\nAnd so the more that were actually working together with others to address those issues, which is exactly what weve been doing, where the United States has regained and reasserted its leadership in helping to try to move the world forward in addressing, thats where we want to make a big difference, and thats what Im focused on. We still have a greater ability, in my judgment, than any country on earth to mobilize others in positive collective action. And that action is more necessary than its ever been, collective action, because not a single one of these problems is any one country able to solve effectively on its own. We have to find new ways to collaborate, to cooperate, new partnerships. The United States has been leading in the effort to do just that on all of these issues.\n\nAnd the last thing is this: one of the things I think we know from history is that the world doesnt organize itself. So if the United States is not engaged in working to do a lot of that organizing, one of two things: either someone else is going to do it, and probably not in a way that reflects our interests or values, or no one does it, and then you have a vacuum, and vacuums tend to be filled by bad things before theyre filled by good things.\n\nMS COLLINS: Or chaos yeah.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Or chaos. Exactly.\n\nMS COLLINS: Well, let me turn to the Q&A. Im sorry, would you mind stating your name and affiliation as you ask the question?\n\nQUESTION: Sure. Hi, Secretary. Im Brian Katulis. Im at the Middle East Institute.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Hi, good to see you.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, thanks for your service. And I commend your team for trying to put diplomacy first on a number of issues, including Iran. A year and a half now into it, whats your assessment of the prospects of what you outlined as your goal on that? And then how do things like the protests and other things move you and your team to maybe start thinking about what a Plan B looks like if the nuclear negotiations dont succeed as youve hoped?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thanks for the question. Well, first, the I think the eyes of the world are focused on Iran, and particularly on the protests. Today marks the 40th day since the killing of Mahsa Amini, which was a day of significance in terms of commemorating her life and her loss. And I think what were seeing across Iran is a quite remarkable expression of frustration, anger, at various policies pursued by the regime. And were seeing this spontaneously, were seeing it in different parts of the country, and it appears to be really from the grassroots up. And I think the world is rightly focused on that.\n\nWeve been, in terms of both the solidarity weve expressed for the people being able to express themselves freely and weve done that not only rhetorically, weve also in terms of the actions weve taken, both in terms of sanctioning those responsible for the repression of the Iranian peoples efforts to speak freely, including the so-called morality police, as well as those who are responsible for supporting the repressive actions of the regime right now with sanctions, but also in trying to help ensure that technology necessary for Iranians to communicate with each other and with the rest of the world, that there are no obstacles to getting that technology to the Iranian people.\n\nWith regard to the JCPOA, the fact of the matter is this: right now I dont see a near-term prospect for that moving forward. Why? Because the Iranians have continued to try to inject extraneous issues into discussions over the JCPOA that are a dead end. And unless and until they decide to drop those, its hard to see the JCPOA moving forward. We remain determined one way or another to make sure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. We continue to believe that diplomacy is actually the best and most effective way to do that, and when it was enforced, the JCPOA actually put Irans nuclear program in a box.\n\nUnfortunately, since the United States pulled out of the agreement, it gave the Iranians an excuse to break out of the box that the agreement had put them in, and weve now seen them take steps that have made their nuclear program increasingly dangerous. And one way or another, we and many countries around the world need to deal with that, and we will. As I say, we continue to believe diplomacy is the best way, but the Presidents been very clear from day one. Even as we sought to get a return to mutual compliance with the JCPOA, were not going to enter into a bad agreement, and were certainly not going to allow Iran to do things that are unacceptable in other areas for the sake of getting back into the agreement.\n\nMS COLLINS: Courtney from Bloomberg.\n\nQUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thanks for joining us. On to another nuclear aspirant. North Korea continues to advance its own capabilities and to resist calls for diplomatic engagement. At what point does the administration have to alter its own approach, given that it is not bearing fruit?\n\nAnd just in our hemisphere, on Haiti. How do you attempt or how does the administration hope to help stabilize the situation in Haiti, given the reluctance to send U.S. personnel, and obviously also the resistance in Haiti to doing so?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thanks. On North Korea, this has been a story thats been playing out over years, decades, in fact, ever since Ive been involved in these issues since first joining the State Department in 1993. And successive administrations have worked to grapple with this. And I think its also fair to say that obviously no one has succeeded in resolving the problem posed by North Koreas nuclear program and the danger that that poses, both in the region, including to our close partners and allies in Japan and Korea, but also well beyond the region.\n\nWhat weve seen North Korea do in recent months is a very large number of missile tests of one kind or another, including specifically recall one that flew right over northern Japan. This is in violation of a series of UN Security Council resolutions. Weve gone to the United Nations, pursued additional sanctions against North Korea. Weve also done two things that I think are vitally important, which is to continue to shore up the defense and deterrent capacities of our partners and allies and ourselves in the region, working closely with Japan and with South Korea so were not standing still in the face of provocations from North Korea. Were making sure that were strengthening our own defense and capacity.\n\nWeve made it clear to the North Koreans going back to last year that we were prepared to engage with them without any preconditions to move toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The North Koreans have not responded to any of those overtures. In fact the response has been exactly what youve cited, which is the increased number of missile tests, the prospect potentially of another nuclear test, which would be the seventh that theyve undertaken.\n\nSo our determination is to work even more closely with our allies and partners to strengthen defense, strengthen deterrence; to work ever more closely with other countries in the international system, including the United Nations, to exert appropriate pressure on North Korea for the actions its taken; and of course to work with other concerned countries to see what influence they can bring to bear on North Korea to stop the dangerous, destabilizing actions that its taken.\n\nWith regard to Haiti, there are a multiplicity of challenges that the Haitian people are facing, some of them nature-made, some of them human-made, all of them exerting a terrible toll on the Haitian people. So first and foremost, we want to do everything we possibly can to help people who are in need. And we continue to do that, including with significant humanitarian assistance. But the fundamental problem right now is one of security, because in the absence of security, virtually everything that we need to do and others need to do to help Haiti to help Haiti move forward politically, to help Haiti move forward economically, to help Haiti more in dealing with now the cholera outbreak that we see there all of those are made much more difficult, if not impossible.\n\nAnd so you have gangs that dominate a lot of space in Haiti, not the state. If the gangs are preventing things moving freely from ports and airports to places where theyre needed whether its fuel, whether its water, whether its medical supplies then dealing with everything else becomes that much more difficult. So dealing with the security problem is, I think, job number one. Weve been working to do that in a few ways. One is to shore up the capacity of the Haitian National Police to actually assert security on behalf of the state and not have the gangs do it. Just a few days ago, along with Canada, we played a lead role, we got additional resources to the Haitian National Police, including armored vehicles that we think could help them in reasserting control.\n\nSecond, we need to (inaudible) a nexus a very noxious nexus, between the gangs and certain elites, political elites who are funding them, directing them, and using them to advance their own interests instead of the interests of the country. We just had, at the United Nations, sanctions passed unanimously at the Security Council, including with the support of China, Russia, and the other members of the Security Council, to go at that nexus and to go at the very elites who are in many cases behind the gangs, supporting them, directing them, financing them. And if we are able to help break that up as well as reinforce the Haitian National Police, then I think the government can get a grip on security.\n\nAs theyre doing that, were also working to support the dialogue that exists between the government, the Montana Group, and others to find a path forward for Haiti on the political track and on getting to elections. And then, of course, if we free up the space because of the dealing with the insecurity problem, thats going to allow the assistance that Haiti desperately needs, including to help deal with cholera, to get into the country more freely. And of course theres a migration aspect to this too, because one of the things were seeing, of course, is Haitians, understandably in many cases, trying to go somewhere else given the horrific challenges they face in Haiti. The more were able to effectively deal with those challenges, the more were able to help Haitians have a more positive life, the less pressure therell be on migration as well.\n\nSo were working on all of those fronts together.\n\nMS COLLINS: Well, Secretary, we appreciate your time so much. I think you have a hard stop out at 12:15, so we will say thank you so much. Were grateful for your insights and for the generosity of your time today. I did just want to ask everyone in the audience if you could remain seated while the Secretary exits, and then well have lunch provided for any of you whod like to stay. Thank you again.",

All times EDT.\n\n11:25 p.m.: Over the 28 years of Alexander Lukashenkos repressive rule, Belarusians who oppose him, despise him, or just want to criticize any particular policy could feel relatively safe expressing their views inside the confines of their homes, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.\n\nNow they may want to think again, legal and digital experts say -- especially if they use things like GPS tracking apps, online dating services, or a voice-controlled virtual assistant like Alisa, a product of the Russia-based Internet company Yandex.\n\nLukashenka signed a decree last week requiring telecom operators and website owners to connect to a new, state-designed system that would allow the Belarusian KGB to surveil almost any online activity.\n\nThe October 18 decree crystalizes a law passed last year that on paper gave state security agencies unlimited powers to spy on citizens digital footprints, including at-home smart devices, but provided no mechanism for doing so.\n\nIn combination with the 2021 law, the new decree allows the KGB to access information that Internet providers, websites, and databases store on individuals from the pages they visit and the messages they post on forums to their activity with online banking services, dating sites, and more.\n\n9:08 p.m.: U.S. automaker Ford has completed its withdrawal from the Russian market with the sale of its 49% stake in the Russian-based Sollers Ford joint venture, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported Thursday.\n\nFord said it had finalized the deal to sell its stake in Sollers Ford for a \"nominal\" undisclosed price.\n\nFord secured an option to buy back the shares within a five-year period \"should the global situation\" change in the coming years, the company said. The joint venture with Russian company Sollers was established in 2011.\n\nFord suspended its business operations in Russia in March citing deep concerns about Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. At the time, Ford took a $122 million write-down in connected with the suspension while stressing that it had already greatly reduced its presence in Russia.\n\nA slew of foreign automakers have halted operations in Russia or exited entirely.\n\nEarlier on October 26, German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz said it would exit Russia by selling shares in its industrial and financial services subsidiaries to a local investor.\n\n8:28 p.m.:\n\n7:51 p.m.: A local official told Russian conscripts, \"You are not cannon fodder,\" in a video published online recently. The men responded by angrily shouting that, actually, that's exactly what they are. The incident, in the Ardatovsky district some 360 kilometers east of Moscow, followed a stream of videos in which Russian conscripts complain of old equipment and poor training.

The Russians did not put a single mark on the grave and did not allow the villagers to go to the cemetery.

Logginov also includes extra items such as bubble solution to keep children entertained, or a square of foam to sit on.\n\n\"I could of course claim that I thought of this myself, but in truth I saw it on the internet,\" grinned Logginov, 63, referring to dozens of social media posts offering tips on how to survive blackouts that can last several hours.\n\n4:31 p.m.:\n\n3:29 p.m.: The Ukrainian capital Kyiv and four regions may have to cut electricity supplies for longer than planned after Russian strikes overnight targeting energy infrastructure, a senior official said on Thursday, Reuters reported.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiys office, said energy supplies would be significantly limited in Kyiv itself and the central regions of Kyiv, Zhytomyr and Cherkasy and the northern region of Chernihiv.\n\nAuthorities had previously said power could be shut off for four hours a day to ease the strain on the generating system as technicians worked to repair the damage.\n\n\"According to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, due to enemy attacks, the previously approved electricity shutdown schedules in these areas will not be observed, and the duration of shutdowns may exceed four hours,\" said a statement on Zelenskiys website.\n\n2:40 p.m.: U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters on Thursday that the U.S. has still not seen anything to indicate that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to use a dirty bomb, The Associated Press reported.\n\nHe said there are continued concerns that the conflict could escalate, and said thats why it is critical for the U.S. to keep the lines of communication open with allies and with Russia.\n\n\"Were going to continue to communicate that any type of use of a weapon of that sort, or even the talk of the use of a weapon of that sort is dangerous and irresponsible,\" said Austin, who spoke with his Russian counterpart twice in the last week. \"Its important to make sure that were talking to adversaries and allies alike and making sure that that were tamping down dangerous talk.\"\n\nAsked if there are concerns Russia might use its upcoming nuclear exercises as a cover for a strike inside Ukraine, Austin said, \"Its something we continue to watch. And we havent seen anything to cause us to believe at this point that that is some kind of cover activity.\"\n\nMoscow has repeatedly made the unfounded claim that Ukraine is preparing to use a \"dirty bomb,\" an explosive devise with radioactive material, on its own territory. Western officials have dismissed the claim as misinformation possibly designed as a pretext for Russia to justify its own military escalation.\n\n2:25 p.m.:\n\n2:10 p.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin says Moscow has no intention to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\"We see no need for that,\" Putin said Thursday at a conference of international foreign policy experts, adding: \"There is no point in that, neither political, nor military.\"\n\nWithout offering evidence, he repeated Moscows claim that Ukraine was plotting to detonate a radioactive \"dirty bomb\" in a false flag attack blaming Russia. Ukraine has rejected the unsubstantiated accusation, and Western allies have dismissed it as \"transparently false.\"\n\nPutin said Russia knows the Ukrainian facilities allegedly working on the purported project and asserted, again without providing proof, that Kyivs plan is to rig a missile with radioactive waste and blow it up, casting it as a Russian nuclear strike. He maintained the goal was to politically isolate Russia and to force its allies to end any cooperation with Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior Ukrainian military officer, Gen. Oleksii Hromov, the chief of the main operational department of the Ukrainian militarys General Staff, on Thursday accused Russia of planning to stage explosions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and blame them on Ukraine in a false flag attack.\n\nRussia took control of the Zaporizhzhia plant in the opening days of the invasion. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of attacking the plant, which has been shut after continuous shelling.\n\n1:05 p.m.:\n\n12:20 p.m.: Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak reacted with scorn to a speech Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered Thursday at a conference of international policy experts, where Putin sought to cast the conflict in Ukraine as part of efforts by the West to secure its global domination.\n\nPutin accused the U.S. and its allies of trying to dictate their terms to other nations in a \"dangerous and bloody\" domination game. The Russian leader claimed that \"he who will sow the wind will reap the whirlwind.\" He said, \"humankind now faces a choice: accumulate a load of problems that will inevitably crush us all or try to find solutions that may not be ideal but working and could make the world more stable and secure,\" The Associated Press reported.\n\nIn a message sent on Twitter, Podolyak characterized Putins comments as Freudian, saying that Putin was the aggressor, and tried to blame the aggression on other countries. Podolyak quoted Putins words back to him, saying the one who starts a wind will get a storm.\n\n11:55 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that the world faced the most dangerous decade since World War II as Western elites scrambled to prevent the inevitable crumbling of the global dominance of the United States and its allies, Reuters reported.\n\nIn a broadside against Washington and its allies, which he accused of inciting the conflict in Ukraine, Putin said the West was playing what he cast as a \"dangerous, bloody and dirty\" geopolitical game that was sowing chaos across the world.\n\n\"The historical period of the West's undivided dominance over world affairs is coming to an end,\" Putin, Russia's paramount leader, told the Valdai Discussion Club. Russia did not consider the West to be an enemy of Russia despite the current phase of confrontation, he added.\n\nRussia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, triggering the biggest confrontation with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis in the depths of the Cold War when the Soviet Union and the United States came closest to nuclear war. Tens of thousands of people have been killed while the West has imposed the most severe sanctions in history on Russia, one of the world's biggest suppliers of natural resources.\n\nPutin cast the conflict in Ukraine as a battle between the West and Russia for the fate of the second largest Eastern Slav country. It was, he said, partly a \"civil war\" as Russians and Ukrainians were one people. Kyiv flatly rejects both those ideas.\n\nAsked about a potential nuclear escalation, Putin said the danger of nuclear weapons usage would exist as long as nuclear weapons existed.\n\n11:25 a.m.: Russias Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Thursday that the threat of a nuclear conflict has risen amid the fighting in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMaria Zakharova argued that \"the more the U.S. is drawn into supporting the Kyiv regime on the battlefield, the more they risk provoking a direct military confrontation between the biggest nuclear powers fraught with catastrophic consequences.\"\n\nShe charged that unlike the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when the Soviets and the United States quickly negotiated a compromise, \"Washington now keeps upping the ante, apparently believing that its capable of controlling the escalation.\"\n\nZakharova said that instead of the ongoing \"thoughtless and mad\" escalation, the U.S. should take a more responsible approach shown during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nThe warning comes as Moscow has made unsubstantiated allegations of a Ukrainian plot to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb, claims rejected by Ukraine and denounced its Western allies as \"transparently false.\"\n\n11:05 a.m.:\n\n10:45 a.m.: Europes energy crisis, triggered by Russia slashing natural gas flows amid its war against Ukraine, has forced some people to turn to cheaper heating sources like firewood as the weather gets colder, The Associated Press reported.\n\nBut as more people stock up and burn wood, prices have skyrocketed, shortages and thefts have been reported, and scams are emerging. Foresters are putting GPS devices into logs to track the valuable stocks, and fears are rising about the environmental impact of increased air pollution and tree-cutting.\n\nThe clamor for firewood is not limited to poorer nations like Moldova but has surged across richer regions of Europe, too. Germany, Poland and the Czech Republics state-owned forests are seeing much stronger demand for the limited amounts of firewood they sell as part of their sustainable forest management.\n\nOften its coming from people who have never ordered firewood before and seem unaware that it needs to be purchased two years ahead so it can dry out enough to be burned in wood stoves, according to the forest service in southwest Germanys state of Hesse.\n\nGerman forest rangers also are seeing more people gathering fallen wood in forests, often not knowing its illegal. Czech state forests, which sell wood only for household consumption, have had to limit the amount of firewood sold to individuals to prevent speculative purchases. In Poland, demand for small firewood from state forests grew 46% and larger firewood was up 42% through the end of August from a year earlier. This was even before fall, when demand for firewood is highest.\n\n10:15 a.m.:\n\n9:50 a.m.: Delegations from Russia and Ukraine are among those meeting in Australia this week to decide the future of Antarcticas pristine waters, The Associated Press reported.\n\nConservationists say new marine protected areas and rules to prevent overfishing are desperately needed, but that Russia could use its veto-like powers to once again block progress.\n\nAchieving the required consensus for action among this diverse group of 27, which also includes China, the United States and the European Union, has always been an immense challenge.\n\nAnd when two of the members are at war and relations between China and many Western nations have deteriorated consensus looms as an even bigger obstacle. Just this month, Russian bombing in Ukraines capital, Kyiv, partially destroyed Ukraines Antarctic research center.\n\nYet despite the enormous political hurdles, some remain hopeful that scientific arguments will win through. The U.S. is paying more attention to the region under President Joe Biden, and this year has sent a relatively high-level delegation led by Monica Medina, an assistant secretary in the State Department.\n\n9:35 a.m.: Ukraines Ministry of Defense said it has conducted 28 prisoner swaps with Russia since February, the Kyiv Independent reported Thursday.\n\nIt quoted Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Maliar as saying 978 Ukrainians have been released from Russian captivity since February 24, including 99 civilians.\n\nThe media organization also quoted Security Service's spokesman Artem Dekhtiarenko as saying that Ukraine has returned the bodies of 579 soldiers.\n\n9:20 a.m.:\n\n8:45 a.m.: Poland tore down four monuments on Thursday to Red Army soldiers who died during World War Two, as historically strained relations between Warsaw and Moscow hit new lows due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nThe legacy of World War II is a divisive issue in Polish-Russian relations, and the conflict in Ukraine has prompted Poland to step up the demolition of memorials to fallen Soviet troops across the country.\n\nRussia argues that it liberated Poland when its forces drove out German Nazis at the end of the war. Most Poles believe that the Soviet Union replaced Nazi occupation with another form of repression.\n\n\"This monument is a monument of lies,\" said Karol Nawrocki, head of Poland's Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), as he stood before a statue in Glubczyce in southern Poland shortly before its demolition.\n\n8:30 a.m.:\n\n8:10 a.m.: Australia said on Thursday it will deploy 70 soldiers to Britain to help train Ukrainian troops there and ship 30 more armored vehicles to bolster Kyivs war against Russias invasion, Reuters reported.\n\n\"We expect this now to be a protracted conflict,\" Defense Minister Richard Marles told ABC television. The latest package takes Australias support for Ukraine to about A$655 million ($425 million) since the conflict began in February.\n\n\"Were mindful that Ukraine needs to now be supported over the longer term if were going to put Ukraine in a position where it can resolve this conflict on its own terms,\" he said.\n\nAustralia, one of the largest non-NATO contributors to the Wests support for Ukraine, has been supplying aid and defense equipment and has banned exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to Russia. It has also placed sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals and entities.\n\nAustralian troops, who will arrive in Britain in January, will join a UK-led international training exercise but will not enter the war zone in Ukraine, Marles said.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba thanked Australia for the latest aid.\n\n7:55 a.m.: Nearly 10 million Ukrainians are potentially at risk of mental disorders including acute stress, anxiety, depression, substance use and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, according to a recent report by the World Economic Forum. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) on Thursday said on Twitter that it is stepping up assistance for those in need.\n\n7:40 a.m.: Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine's occupied region of Zaporizhzhia ordered phone checks on local residents, announcing the implementation of military censorship under Russian President Vladimir Putin's martial law decree, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"From today in the Zaporizhzhia region, law enforcement officers have begun a selective preventing check of the mobile phones of citizens,\" Moscow-appointed official Vladimir Rogov said. He said those subscribed to \"propaganda resources of the terrorist Kyiv regime\" will receive a warning, before being fined.\n\n7:25 a.m.: Uzbek workers of a waste processing plant in the western Russian city of Oryol, who were handed mobilization notices and ordered to show up at the local conscription point, asked their president for help, Reuters reported Thursday, citing a local news outlet.\n\nMoscow started the mobilization campaign, its first since World War II, last month as its military campaign in Ukraine stalled and Russian forces began to lose ground. Hundreds of thousands of men have since fled Russia to avoid being sent to the front lines.\n\nAccording to the Istoki video report, Oryol authorities sent out a fresh batch of mobilization notices this week, including 50 to workers of the EcoCity waste processing facility.\n\nHalf of the workers, however, are Uzbek nationals, it said, showing a group of men displaying their Uzbek passports and asking Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to intervene on their behalf.\n\nThe mobilization campaign drew criticism after notices were served to many people not eligible for military service, prompting Russian President Vladimir Putin to order officials to correct all mistakes.\n\nUzbekistan has warned its citizens against joining foreign armies, which qualifies as a felony under Uzbek law.\n\nUzbekistan's embassy in Moscow could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\n7:15 a.m.:\n\n6:50 a.m.: Ukraine is bolstering its defenses near the border with Belarus, Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine's General Staff said that, while troops don't appear to be gathering across the boundary, \"there are and will be threats.\"\n\nRussia has been reportedly massed troops in Belarus, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko earlier this month ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine, accusing Ukraine and its allies of planning an attack on Belarus.\n\n\"Strikes on the territory of Belarus are not just being discussed in Ukraine today, but are also being planned,\" he said, without providing evidence for the assertion.\n\n6:30 a.m.: The head of the Crimean city of Sevastopol said a power plant just outside the city has come under a drone attack, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMikhail Razvozhayev said early Thursday a drone hit a transformer and sparked a fire but didnt affect the operation. Razvozhayev said that electricity supplies havent been interrupted.\n\nCrimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, has faced drone attacks and explosions from supporters of Ukraine.\n\nIn a major setback for Russia on Oct. 8, a powerful truck bomb blew up a section of a strategic 19-kilometer bridge linking Crimea to Russias mainland.\n\n6:15 a.m.: The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a report Thursday that the war in Ukraine and economic factors may ramp up development of green energy, and the use of natural gas and other fossil fuels will level off and then decline in the next 15 years, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"The energy world is shifting dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point toward a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system,\" the IEA's executive director Fatih Birol Birol said.\n\n5:57 a.m.:\n\n5:16 a.m.: Concerns of Germans that dissipated with the fall of the Berlin Wall are now creeping back after decades of peace, according to Reuters.\n\nIt's a flashback for a nation that found itself at the geographic and political center of the Cold War.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has escalated his \"special military operation\" in Ukraine - calling up reservists and threatening to use nuclear weapons to defend Russian land, while U.S. President Joe Biden has talked of \"Armageddon\".\n\nA survey by insurer R+V found that 42% of Germans now fear a war with German participation, up from 16% last year, the biggest jump since the Kosovo War in 1999.\n\n4:45 a.m.: The latest update from Britains Ministry of Defense Thursday says that the Russian government is interlinking regional governors into the national security system, thereby taking further steps to organize society as Russias war in Ukraine comes under pressure.\n\n4:15 a.m.: Iran may soon boost its involvement on behalf of Russia in the invasion of Ukraine, according to an analysis published by Foreign Policy. In addition to supplying Russia with more drones a charge Tehran denies Iran may soon sell Fateh-110 and Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missiles to supplement Russia's shrinking supply of its own missiles. Members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard are already deployed in Ukraine and Belarus to train Russian troops to use the Iranian drones, according to reports. An Israeli news agency last week reported that 10 Iranian soldiers died as Ukraine struck Russian forces.\n\n4:05 a.m.:\n\n3:50 a.m.: The area around Kherson, one of the first cities in Ukraine captured by Russia after it invaded in February, is now the scene of intense fighting as Ukrainian soldiers attempt to retake it, The New York Times reports. A nearby hydroelectric dam is the last major crossing over the Dnipro River available to Russian forces. If Ukraine captures the dam, thousands of soldiers may be left with no way to retreat.\n\nAccording to the report, the Russian occupiers are stepping up measures aimed at getting civilians to abandon the city and flee to Russia ahead of the expected battle for the city.\n\n\"We live, like, in a dystopian movie here,' one resident told The Times.\n\n2:45 a.m.:\n\n2:20 a.m.: News reports and social media in Russia indicate that many of the soldiers heading for the frontlines in Ukraine may not be well-equipped or well-trained, according to the Associated Press.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin last month ordered the conscription of about 300,000 men to bolster Russia's forces fighting in Ukraine. During a photo-op at a military facility earlier this week, Putin was seen talking to soldiers in new uniforms and equipped with combat gear, including helmets and bulletproof vests. But independent media and rights groups suggest the call-up is poorly organized, and men are being moved to combat duty without adequate training or gear.\n\nRecruits posted video on social media showing rusty weapons and filthy living conditions.\n\nActivists also report that ethnic minorities in some regions are being drafted in numbers disproportionate in comparison to other regions of Russia.\n\n1:00 a.m.:\n\n12:05 a.m.: Chicago wheat futures gained more ground on Thursday, with slowing exports from the Black Sea region amid the Russian-Ukraine war raising concerns about world supplies.\n\nConcerns over Ukrainian grain exports mounted as data from the country's farm ministry showed that shipments have slowed over the past 10 days, with volumes so far this month 9% behind the same period last year.\n\nUkraine on Sunday said Russia was blocking the full implementation of a Black Sea grain export deal, forcing Ukrainian ports to work at 25% to 30% of their capacity, Reuters reported.\n\nThe agreement, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July, paved the way for Ukraine to resume grain exports from Black Sea ports that had been shut since Russia invaded in February.\n\nUnited Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said on Wednesday that he was \"relatively optimistic\" that a U.N.-brokered deal that allowed a resumption of Ukraine Black Sea grain exports would be extended beyond mid-November. Griffiths traveled to Moscow with senior U.N. trade official Rebeca Grynspan earlier this month for discussions with Russian officials on the deal, which also aims to facilitate exports of Russian grain and fertilizer to global markets.\n\nSome information in this report came from Agence France-Presse, The Associated Press and Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that the war in Ukraine was part of Russia's wider struggle against Western domination, and warned that the world is probably entering the \"most dangerous\" decade since the end of World War II.\n\nThe Russian leader showed no sign of backpedaling on the eight-month-old invasion of Ukraine, and indeed painted the current situation as part of the decline of Western dominance in global affairs.\n\nPutin's comments on the global situation at the annual Valdai Discussion Club meeting were answered indirectly by the US Defense Department's release of its formal National Defense strategy, in which it painted Moscow as an \"acute threat\" to Western values.\n\n\"Putin's reckless war of choice against Ukraine -- the worst threat to European security since the end of World War Two -- has made that very clear for the whole world,\" said US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.\n\n- 'Tectonic shifts' -\n\nThe heady rhetoric took place as fighting ground on in Ukraine's east and south, with neither side claiming significant gains.\n\n\"The historical period of undivided dominance of the West in world affairs is coming to an end,\" said Putin. \"The unipolar world is becoming a thing of the past.\n\nWhile the West was still \"desperately\" trying to govern humanity, it was not able to. \"Most peoples of the world no longer want to put up with it,\" he said.\n\nThe Ukraine offensive, he said, was simply part of the \"tectonic shifts of the entire world order.\"\n\n\"Russia is not challenging the elites of the West, Russia is just trying to defend its right to exist,\" he said.\n\n- More 'dirty bomb' talk -\n\nPutin said using nuclear weapons in Ukraine would \"make no sense at all to us -- either in political or military terms.\"\n\nBut Moscow again raised the allegation that Ukraine planned to use a \"dirty bomb\" -- a crude, small nuclear weapon -- in the war.\n\nIt filed a complaint Thursday with the UN Security Council demanding an international investigation into the United States' \"military-biological activities\" in Ukraine. The US rejected the accusation, while the UN said it was \"not aware\" of any such program in Ukraine.\n\nAfter a closed-door UN Security Council meeting, Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said they were serious about the dirty bomb allegation.\n\n\"We would be happy to be mistaken, but we cannot simply ignore this,\" he said.\n\n\"These allegations are very serious and may lead to very, very unfortunate consequences,\" he said.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog, said it would carry out an \"independent verification\" in Ukraine this week, inspecting the locations that Moscow tied to its allegations.\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Grossi, who attended the Security Council meeting, said they would work \"to detect any diversion of nuclear material under safeguards, any undeclared production or processing of nuclear material at the two locations and assure that there are no undeclared nuclear material and activities.\"\n\nThe agency said it had inspected \"one of the two locations a month ago and no undeclared nuclear activities or materials were found there.\"\n\n- New worries on grain exports -\n\nBoth Ukraine and the United States raised fresh concerns about the pace of grain exports from Ukraine, vital to the world but which Ukraine says are being held up by Russian ship inspections.\n\nOn Wednesday, after meeting with Guinea-Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo, who represented the Economic Community of West African States, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said there was a backup of 175 ships waiting to pick up and deliver grain.\n\nZelensky said the backup was a \"deterioration of access to food for millions of people\" in Africa, Asia and Europe.\n\nIn Ottawa on Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia would face \"great anger\" if it backs out of the pact to permit Ukraine grain stocks to be delivered to global markets.\n\nThe 120-day pact expires on November 19, and the backup of the ships and uncertainty over whether it will be renewed has already caused prices of some food products to rise.\n\n\"The idea that Russia would now say it doesn't want to continue it, it wants to turn it off, I think, will be met with great anger by countries around the world who are benefiting from Ukrainian grain,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"I think it's profoundly in everyone's interest to make sure that this grain can continue to move out of Ukraine and certainly, we will do everything we can to sustain the agreement,\" he said.",

All times EDT.\n\n10:13 p.m.: A planned underwater energy pipeline linking Barcelona in Spain and Marseille in France could take up to seven years to build, Spain's energy minister said Friday, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nFrance, Spain and Portugal announced Thursday they had agreed to build the maritime pipeline instead of a long-discussed pipeline across the Pyrenees but gave no timeline for its construction.\n\nThe underwater pipeline, dubbed BarMar, would initially be used for natural gas but, over time, more and more for hydrogen.\n\nSpain and Portugal had lobbied hard for the construction of a 190-kilometer pipeline across the Pyrenees to France, which would allow the shipment of gas further on into Germany, but France opposed it.\n\n9 p.m.: The World Central Kitchen, which is feeding Ukrainians affected by the war, is also helping to feed the pets of Ukraine, according to WCK CEO.\n\n8:22 p.m.: France's foreign minister said Friday it was vital to keep lines of communication open with Russia, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"We absolutely think it is crucial to keep a channel of communication with those making the decisions in Russia, including President Putin,\" French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said on a visit to Washington.\n\n\"Putin is probably isolated in his very strange vision of the world and the way it could be run. Reinforcing this isolation of his would not be a good option,\" she said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"We need him to hear when we mention our analysis and our assessment of the mistakes he made and what he could do to move on in a different direction,\" she said.\n\n7:47 p.m.: Missile attacks in the cities of Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia caused civilian casualties and damaged civilian infrastructure, including a school in Zaporizhzhia, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Friday during a humanitarian update on Ukraine, reports Margaret Besheer, VOAs United Nations correspondent.\n\nPower outages continue across four northern and central oblasts of Ukraine, as well as in the capital, Kyiv, Dujarric said.\n\nOn Thursday, a convoy of eight trucks delivered shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene materials to Velyka Oleksandrivka, a newly retaken area of southern Khersonska oblast. The supplies were provided by the International Organization for Migration, the U.N. Refugee Agency and the World Health Organization.\n\nAlso on Thursday, with the help of a local non-governmental organization, UNHCR delivered emergency shelter materials to a settlement in Zaporizhka. The delivery followed a missile attack that damaged or destroyed about 200 homes.\n\nUNHCR also provided generators and fan heaters to local authorities in the northern Sumska oblast to enable hospitals and other civilian infrastructure to keep running following missile attacks.\n\n6:57 p.m.: Spanish authorities moved a luxury yacht linked to the sanctioned head of Russian defense group Rostec after the shipyard where it was berthed stopped receiving payments for its repairs, a transport ministry source said, according to Reuters.\n\nThe multi-million-dollar Valerie was transferred to a marina last month, the source and other officials said, highlighting the logistical challenges authorities have faced managing vessels being held across Europe because of sanctions imposed over Russia's military actions in Ukraine.\n\n6:18 p.m.: The White House is in talks with billionaire Elon Musk about setting up SpaceX's satellite internet service Starlink in Iran, CNN reported on Friday, citing officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe satellite-based broadband service could help Iranians circumvent the regime's restrictions on accessing the internet and certain social media platforms.\n\nThe Islamic Republic has been engulfed by protests that erupted after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody last month.\n\nSpaceX and the White House did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\n5:25 p.m.: U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Friday.\n\n4:30 p.m.: The Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric dam in southern Ukraine was captured in the beginning of the invasion because of its strategic importance: it supplies the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula with water, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nLocated on the Dnieper River, the dam is one of the biggest facilities of its kind in Ukraine. And the reservoir behind it can hold 18km3 of water.\n\nBuilt in Soviet times in the 1950s, the Kakhovka dam pumps water into the North Crimean canal, which starts in southern Ukraine and crosses the entire Crimean Peninsula.\n\nThe dam and the hydroelectric power station were captured by Russian troops at the very start of the invasion on February 24.\n\nIf the dam were to burst, hundreds of thousands of people around the lower Dnieper would be in danger of flooding, including the city of Kherson itself.\n\n3:23 p.m.: The Ukrainian president's office said on Friday that 88 towns and villages had been recaptured in the southern Kherson region, where Ukrainian forces have been advancing in recent weeks, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"Kherson region: 88 settlements de-occupied,\" Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president's office, said on social media.\n\nLast week, Kyiv said 75 towns and villages had been liberated in the region.\n\nWhen exactly the settlements were recaptured is unclear.\n\n2:30 p.m: Ukrainian forces bombarded Russian positions in the occupied and illegally annexed southern Kherson region, targeting resupply routes across a major river while inching closer Friday to a full assault on one of the first urban areas Russia captured after invading the country, The Associated Press reported.\n\nRussian-installed officials were reported desperately trying to turn the city of Kherson, a prime objective for both sides because of its key industries and major river and sea port, into a fortress while attempting to evacuate tens of thousands of residents.\n\nThe Kremlin poured as many as 2,000 draftees into the Kherson region one of four provinces Moscow illegally annexed and put under Russian martial law to replenish losses and strengthen front-line units, according to the Ukrainian armys general staff.\n\nThe Dnieper River figures prominently in the regional battle because it serves critical functions crossings for supplies, troops and civilians; drinking water for southern Ukraine and the annexed Crimean Peninsula; and power generation from a hydroelectric station. Much of the area, including the power station and a canal feeding water to Crimea, is under Russian control.\n\n1:40 p.m.: During their counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces had to cross the Oskil River to push the enemy out of key settlements. After their successful operations, a bridgehead was created on the left bank that allowed them to liberate other strategic villages in the area. Some of the Ukrainian soldiers described their tactics in detail for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalists.\n\n1:05 p.m.: Britain, France and Germany on Friday called for a United Nations probe of accusations Russia has used Iranian-origin drones to attack Ukraine, allegedly violating a U.N. Security Council Resolution, Reuters reported.\n\nIn a letter signed by their U.N. envoys and seen by Reuters, the three backed Ukraine's call on Monday for such a probe, arguing the drone use breached U.N. Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2231 endorsing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\"We would welcome an investigation by the UN Secretariat team responsible for monitoring the implementation of UNSCR 2231 and stand ready to support the work of the Secretariat in conducting its technical and impartial investigation,\" the three nations, a group known as the E3, said in the letter.\n\n12:25 p.m.:\n\n11:45 a.m.: The European Union will give Kyiv 1.5 billion euros a month in 2023 to help run Ukraine as it fights back Russia's invading troops, the head of the bloc's executive said on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke after the 27 national EU leaders discussed supporting Ukraine during a second day of their summit in Brussels on Friday, the 240th day of Russia's war on its neighbor.\n\nShe said that the EU has so far given Ukraine 19 billion euros this year but that the summit looked at 2023.\n\n\"It is very important for Ukraine to have a predictable and stable flow of income,\" she said, adding that Kyiv estimated its monthly needs at 3-4 billion euros \"for the basics.\n\n11:30 a.m.: A court in Prague has acquitted a Russian citizen who was accused of taking part in Moscow's illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported Friday.\n\nThe Prague City Court ruled on October 20 that there wasn't enough evidence to prove Aleksandr Franchetti's involvement in organizing a criminal group and the illegal incarceration of 11 pro-Ukrainian residents of Crimea during the annexation of the peninsula.\n\nFranchetti remains in custody because the court's ruling was appealed by prosecutors.\n\nFranchetti was arrested in September last year at Ukraine's request. Kyiv accuses him of being an active participant in the events in Crimea in 2014 by joining paramilitary formations called North Wind and Crimea's Self-Defense. The two groups helped seize power lines and gas pipelines during the annexation.\n\nCzech media reports said earlier that Franchetti was granted permanent residence in the Czech Republic in 2000 and has worked in the country as a fitness trainer.\n\n11:15 a.m.:\n\n11:05 a.m.: Russia has hit at least half of Ukraine's thermal generation capacity and caused billions of dollars of damage in attacks since October 10, but not all stricken power units have stopped working completely, Ukraine's energy minister said on Friday.\n\nHerman Halushchenko told Reuters in an interview that 30-40% of overall national power infrastructure had been hit in attacks that he depicted as intended to destroy Ukraine's energy system -- a goal that he said had not been achieved.\n\n10:40 a.m.: The Defense Department says U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin has spoken on the phone to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu.\n\nFridays call was the first time the two had spoken since May 13. Defense officials have said that for some time the Russians had not responded to U.S. efforts to set up calls.\n\nVOAs national security correspondent Jeff Seldin shared the details on Twitter.\n\nAustin also spoke with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov \"to reiterate the unwavering U.S. commitment to supporting Ukraines ability to counter Russias aggression\" as well as the international communitys support for Ukraines future defense, according to a Defense Department statement.\n\n10:25 a.m.: Sweden has taken \"concrete action\" to address Turkey's concerns over its NATO membership bid, including stepping up counter-terrorism efforts against Kurdish militants, Stockholm told Ankara in a letter dated October 6 and seen by Reuters.\n\nThe two-page letter gives 14 examples of steps taken by Sweden to show it \"is fully committed to the implementation\" of a memorandum it signed with Turkey and Finland in June, which resulted in NATO member Turkey lifting its veto of their applications to the trans-Atlantic security alliance.\n\nSwedish officials delivered the letter, which was not previously reported, to Erdogan's office and the foreign ministry at the weekend, a source familiar with the situation said, requesting anonymity due to sensitivity over it.\n\nThe letter was meant to reassure Turkey of Sweden's efforts amid ongoing bilateral talks and to encourage ultimate approval of the NATO membership bid, the source added. According to the letter, Swedish authorities \"carried out new analyses of PKK's role in threats to Sweden's national security and in organized crime (and) this is likely to lead to concrete results.\"\n\n10:10 a.m.:\n\n9:50 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin has been open for negotiations with Ukraine \"from the very beginning,\" and \"nothing has changed\" in that respect, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday, commenting on remarks made by the Turkish president, The Associated Press reported.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan said earlier that Putin appeared to be \"much softer and more open to negotiations\" than in the past. \"We are not without hope,\" he said of the possibility of negotiations to end the conflict.\n\n\"If you remember, President Putin tried to initiate talks with both NATO and the United States even before the special military operation,\" Peskov said, referring to Russias aggression against Ukraine that started almost eight months ago.\n\nRussian officials have repeatedly said they will not negotiate the return of the four Ukrainian regions Moscow illegally annexed last month. After the land grab, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ruled out any talks with Moscow as long as Putin remains president.\n\n9:35 a.m.:\n\n9:20 a.m.: Russia has been sending in thousands of recently mobilized troops to reinforce the defense of the southern region of Kherson, where Kyiv's forces have been making major advances in their offensive to retake territory occupied by Moscow, the Ukrainian military said, as fresh Russian strikes on civilian targets were reported on Friday, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\n\"Up to 2,000 mobilized Russians arrived in the temporarily captured Kherson region to replenish losses and strengthen units on the contact line,\" the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"At the same time, the occupation authorities issued an order to prepare for the evacuation of the so-called banking institutions and Russian medical workers and teachers,\" the statement said.\n\nUkraine is trying to drive Russian forces in Kherson back east across the Dnieper River that bisects the country. Russian soldiers on the western bank, where the city of Kherson is located, are reportedly close to being cut off from supply lines and reinforcements.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said the Kremlin's forces repelled Ukrainian attempts to advance with tanks on the Kherson villages of Sukhanove, Nova Kamyanka, and Chervoniy Yar.\n\nNeither claim could be independently confirmed.\n\n9:05 a.m.:\n\n8:55 a.m.: European Union leaders struggled to find immediate practical solutions on how to deal with the energy crisis but avoided an open rift between Germany and France on Friday that would have exposed a divided bloc as it confronts Russian President Vladimir Putin over his war in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nAfter daylong talks in Brussels dragged well into the night, the 27 EU leaders papered over divisions between some of the biggest member states and at least agreed to continue working on ways to impose a gas price cap in case of big price increases.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron highlighted his work with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to create a veneer of unity after talks that started early Thursday. He said that together with close technical advisers, \"I will see Chancellor Scholz in Paris next week so that we can move forward, with our teams, on all the issues.\"\n\nScholz said the main issue was curbing \"spikes\" in gas trading that may last only a few hours but still send prices excessively upward. He said measures to counter that should be further examined.\n\n8:40 a.m.:\n\n8:25 a.m.: European Union leaders will discuss reducing their economic dependency on China, aiding Kyiv and punishing Iran for its involvement in the war that Russia is waging on Ukraine, when they meet for a second day of talks in Brussels on Friday, Reuters reported.\n\nThe previous day, the 27 EU leaders locked horns over a joint response to the acute energy crunch that has engulfed the bloc since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nTheir summit talks started on Thursday afternoon and ran into the wee hours on Friday as Germany stuck to its refusal to cap gas prices and the 27 could only agree to disagree, declaring they will keep on examining options to put a ceiling on costs.\n\nAs they turn to foreign policy on Friday, they will have a \"strategic discussion\" on their ties with China after the bloc's executive said earlier this week the EU should see Beijing more as a competitor.\n\n\"We have been a bit too complacent as European countries,\" said Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo. \"Over the past months, we've understood that in a lot of pure economic domains, geopolitics also play an important role.\"\n\n8:10 a.m.:\n\n7:50 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the West to warn Russia not to blow up a huge dam that would flood a swath of southern Ukraine, as his forces prepare to push Moscows troops from Kherson in one of the wars most important battles, Reuters reported.\n\nIn a television address, Zelenskyy said Russian forces had planted explosives inside the huge Nova Kakhovka dam, which holds back an enormous reservoir that dominates much of southern Ukraine, and were planning to blow it up to cover their retreat.\n\n\"Now everyone in the world must act powerfully and quickly to prevent a new Russian terrorist attack. Destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster,\" he said.\n\nRussia accused Kyiv earlier this week of planning to rocket the dam. Sergei Surovikin, the commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, said Ukrainian forces had already used U.S.-supplied HIMARS missiles against it in what Ukrainian officials called a sign Moscow could be planning to blow it up and blame Kyiv.\n\nNeither side produced evidence to back up their allegations.\n\n7:35 a.m.:\n\n7:20 a.m.: Iran advised its citizens on Friday not to travel to Ukraine and urged Iranians already there to leave, semi-official news agencies reported, a day after the United States accused Iran of helping Russia operate drones against Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Iranian foreign ministry advisory did not refer to the U.S. allegation. It gave a telephone number for the Iranian embassy in Kyiv to call for advice.\n\n\"Due to the military escalation in Ukraine, all Iranians are strongly advised to refrain from traveling to Ukraine. Also, Iranians living in Ukraine are advised to leave the country for their own safety,\" the ministry statement said.\n\n7:05 a.m.:\n\n6:50 a.m.: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan was quoted as saying on Friday he will meet with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson to discuss the Nordic country's bid to join NATO, as well as the extradition of people Ankara considers terrorists, Reuters reported.\n\nErdogan also said Kristersson, who was recently appointed prime minister, sided with the fight against terrorism, broadcaster NTV reported.\n\n6:30 a.m.:\n\n6:20 a.m.: The Kremlin on Friday sidestepped a question about whether or not President Vladimir Putin had given an order for Russian forces to withdraw from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, Reuters reported.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred the question to Russia's defence ministry.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters, when asked directly whether Putin had ordered a withdrawal, Peskov said: \"This question concerns the conduct of the special military operation, I recommend you address it to the defence ministry.\"\n\n6:10 a.m.:\n\n5:50 a.m.: The photograph, showing a man in combat fatigues posing on a river ferry alongside Russian military equipment, was posted on Russian social media on October 10. Three days later, a video that appeared on the same account seemed to show the same ferry and equipment, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\n\"And we're moving,\" the man, identified as Makar Teplinskiy, from the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk, says in the video. Later, off-screen, a voice can be heard asking, \"Who are you showing that to?\"\n\nThe ferry appears to be part of an ongoing Russian pullback of soldiers and equipment from the right bank of the Dnieper River, in the southern Kherson region, where Ukrainian forces have been making gradual advances. The video was identified and pinpointed by RFE/RL using geolocation, satellite imagery, and surrounding landmarks.\n\nThe findings, by RFE/RL's Russian Service and Schemes, the investigative unit of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, highlight the mounting pressure on Russian forces, who have been pummeled by Ukrainian troops pushing southward. Experts say the advances are likely to lead up to an effort to take back the city of Kherson itself -- the only regional capital to fall to Russian forces since Moscow launched a large-scale invasion on February 24.\n\n5:40 a.m.:\n\n5:25 a.m.: A luxury yacht belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarch Alexey Mordashov departed Hong Kong waters on Thursday, Reuters reported, heading for the South African port of Cape Town, according to private tracking site MarineTraffic.\n\nThe prominent sight of the 141-meter multideck Nord in the city's Victoria harbour in recent weeks had sparked criticism from the United States' State Department, which questioned the transparency of the financial hub and warned of reputational risks.\n\nMordashov, a billionaire close to President Vladimir Putin, was among several Russians sanctioned by the United States and European Union, but not the United Nations, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine for their links to Putin.\n\nWhile several Russian superyachts have been seized or denied entry in Europe and other jurisdictions, the Nord was left undisturbed in Hong Kong after its arrival on Oct. 5.\n\n5:09 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that Russia is likely continuing to prepare for a false-flag attack on the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Iran, the Institute said, is providing military support to Russian forces in Ukraine despite new international sanctions likely in part because Iranian leaders believe that they need Moscows help to upend the U.S.-led global order.\n\n4:25 a.m.:\n\n4:08 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry mentioned a video claiming to show the arrival of Russian troops in Belarus. The announcement is likely an attempt to demonstrate Russian-Belarussian solidarity and to convince Ukraine to divert forces to guard the northern border, the update said.\n\n3:04 a.m.: Jailed Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny said on Thursday that authorities had opened a new criminal case against him for promoting terrorism and extremism, potentially more than doubling his sentence, Reuters reported.\n\nNavalny, the most prominent domestic critic of President Vladimir Putin, is already serving prison terms totaling 11 1/2 years for fraud, contempt of court and parole violations, all of which he rejects as trumped-up charges intended to silence him.\n\n\"You all thought I had been isolated in prison for two years, but it turns out I was actively committing crimes. Luckily, the Investigative Committee was vigilant and didn't miss a thing,\" he said on Twitter.\n\n2:06 a.m.:\n\n1:06 a.m.: Talks on extending a July deal that resumed Ukraine Black Sea grain and fertilizer exports are not making much progress because Russian concerns are not being taken into proper account, Russia's U.N. ambassador in Geneva said on Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nSenior United Nations officials are negotiating with Russia to extend and expand the July 22 deal that could expire next month if an agreement is not reached.\n\n\"I wouldn't say that much has been achieved as a result of the latest consultations. The dialogue is continuing,\" Gennady Gatilov told reporters.\n\nHe reiterated Moscow's stance that Western sanctions were hamstringing its own exports of grain and fertilizer, even to poor countries that need the supplies.\n\n12:02 a.m.: Ukrainians turned off domestic appliances, wrapped themselves in blankets to keep warm and remained defiant Thursday as they faced the first nationwide electricity outages of the war against Russia.\n\nIn response to requests by the president and government, towns and cities restricted power supplies and limited electricity use so that energy companies could repair power facilities hit by a wave of Russian air strikes.\n\nCities including the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv in the northeast announced curbs on the use of electric-powered public transport such as trolleybuses and reduced the frequency of underground trains as winter looms.\n\nSome information in this report came from Reuters.",

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight On a day of heavy fighting and fast-moving developments across multiple combat zones, the Ukrainians appeared to extend their recent successes in recapturing occupied territories and pushing Moscows troops into retreat in areas that President Vladimir Putin has claimed now belong to Russia.\n\nAway from the battlefield, the Kremlin continued to push a claim, asserted repeatedly without evidence, that Kyiv was preparing to use a \"dirty bomb,\" a weapon that combines conventional explosives with radioactive material an accusation that was dismissed by the United States and other Western nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. officials said that Moscows allegations raised a risk that Russia itself was planning to carry out a radiation attack, potentially as a pretext to justify further escalation of the war amid its continuing territorial setbacks.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Ukraines nuclear energy operator, Energoatom, issued a similar warning, citing the Russian militarys control over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar. \"Energoatom assumes that such actions of the occupiers may indicate that they are preparing a terrorist act using nuclear materials and radioactive waste stored at the ZNPP site,\" the statement said.\n\nThe renewed fears of some kind of radiation attack added to the ominous sense that Putins war in Ukraine is growing even more deadly and dangerous as each side seeks to redraw facts on the ground before winter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine has been pushing hard for further territorial gains, while Russia this month began a relentless bombing campaign against Ukraines energy system, using missiles and attack drones in an apparent bid to plunge the country into cold and darkness, and potentially compensate for battlefield losses.\n\nSetbacks in its invasion of Ukraine have led to increased nuclear threats by Russia, echoing Cold War events like the little-known 1983 nuclear crisis. (Video: Joshua Carroll/The Washington Post)\n\nAs Ukraine continued to make gains, pro-Kremlin military bloggers and analysts confirmed new setbacks for Russias forces Tuesday, including in Luhansk, the easternmost occupied region of Ukraine, where Russia has had its firmest grip.\n\n\"The Ukrainian army has resumed its counteroffensive in the Luhansk direction,\" the pro-Russian WarGonzo project said in its daily military update, adding that Ukrainian forces took control of a key highway between the Luhansk towns of Svatove and Kreminna.\n\n\"The Russian artillery is actively working on the left bank of Zherebets river and is trying to stop the transfer of reinforcements to the enemy but the situation is very difficult,\" WarGonzo said.\n\nIn the Donetsk region, the Wagner paramilitary force, controlled by St. Petersburg businessman Yevgeniy Prigozhin, appeared to be getting pushed back from Bakhmut, where the mercenaries had spent weeks pummeling the city but making small gains. Military experts said there was little strategic value in seizing Bakhmut, but Prigozhin seems to see a chance to claim a political prize, while regular Russian military units lose ground in other combat zones.\n\nUkrainian forces have recaptured a concrete factory on Bakhmuts eastern outskirts, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War reported Monday. On Sunday, Prigozhin acknowledged the slow pace of Wagners effort, saying the mercenaries were gaining only \"100-200 meters a day.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Our units are constantly meeting with the most fierce enemy resistance, and I note that the enemy is well prepared, motivated, and works confidently and harmoniously,\" Prigozhin said in a statement published by his catering companys press service. \"This does not prevent our fighters from moving forward, but I cannot comment on how long it will take.\"\n\nIn the southern Kherson region, one of the four Moscow claimed to have annexed, Russian forces appeared to be preparing to defend the city of Kherson, amid speculation they would pull back to the eastern side of the Dnieper River, ceding crucial ground.\n\nResidents displaced from Russian-occupied Kherson, Ukraine, arrived on buses in Dzhankoi, Crimea, on Oct. 24. (Video: Reuters, Photo: Reuters/Reuters)\n\nThe Ukrainian military said in its Tuesday operational update that Russian troops were setting up \"defensive positions\" along the east bank of the Dnieper and leaving small passages for a potential retreat from the west bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeculation on whether Moscow is preparing to abandon Kherson has been circulating for weeks after Ukrainian forces made steady breakthroughs in the southern direction.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\"I dont know all the nuances and plans of the command, but I dont exclude the surrender of Kherson as from a military point of view its defense at the moment could turn into a rout,\" a popular Russian military blogger, who writes under the moniker Zapiski Veterana, wrote in a Telegram post. \"But I think that if a decision was made in Moscow to fight until victory, then there is nothing tragic in the surrender of Kherson because this war is here for a long time.\"\n\nMoscow may not have a choice. \"The Russian position in upper Kherson Oblast is, nevertheless, likely untenable,\" the Institute for the Study of War said.\n\nKremlin-installed officials have been forcing residents to evacuate from the west bank of the Dnieper while claiming without evidence that Kyiv is preparing attacks on the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, as well as the \"dirty bomb\" allegations.\n\nThe United States, France and Britain accused Moscow of using allegations of a dirty bomb as a pretext for escalation, and they warned that Putins government would face additional punitive action by the West.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, the Kremlin called Washingtons distrust of Russias claims \"an impermissible and frivolous approach.\"\n\nAfter a two-week bombing campaign, in which Moscow systemically targeted energy infrastructure, Kyiv is increasingly concerned about civilians enduring a bitter winter. Ukrainian officials have spent the past few weeks pressing European officials for more sophisticated weapons, particularly the advanced air defense systems required to fend off Russias aerial assaults.\n\nThe country also faces an urgent cash crunch, with officials raising questions about how Ukraine will secure funding to keep services running through the brutal weeks and months ahead. An early October projection from the World Bank suggested Ukraines economy will contract by 35 percent this year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Germany and the European Union hosted a conference in Berlin about reconstruction, though the conversation seemed especially premature given Russian attacks that yield fresh destruction each day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine needs about $38 billion in emergency economic aid for next year alone. But while top officials regularly trumpet the E.U.s support for Ukraine, there are questions about short- and long-term follow-through.\n\nEven as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has touted plans to help Ukraine through 2023, for instance, E.U. officials acknowledge delays in delivering to Kyiv the roughly $9 billion in loans pledged earlier this year.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen pressed European counterparts in recent weeks to step up financial assistance to Kyiv and has indirectly questioned the decision to offer loans rather than grants.\n\n\"We are calling on our partners and allies to join us by swiftly disbursing their existing commitments to Ukraine and by stepping up in doing more,\" Yellen said this month. In a video address to a European Council summit in Brussels last week, Zelensky called out European leaders for failing to deliver much-needed economic assistance quickly enough.\n\n\"Thank you for the funds that have already been allocated,\" Zelensky said. \"But a decision has not yet been made on the remaining $6 billion from this package which is critically needed this year.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It is in your power,\" he continued, \"to reach a principled agreement on the provision of this assistance to our state today already.\"\n\nWith existing needs unmet, some wonder how seriously to take the E.U.s promises of an effort of Marshall Plan proportions. A Q&A published by Germanys Group of Seven presidency ahead of Tuesdays conference noted that the event would not include a \"pledging segment.\" Instead, the purpose is to \"underline that the international community is united and resolute in its support to Ukraine.\"\n\nIn private conversations, some E.U. diplomats raised questions about whether the bloc ought to be allocating resources for the reconstruction of a country that is still very much at war, particularly given Europes own energy and economic crises.",

Pat Ryder said. \"And as weve highlighted before, this is a routine annual exercise by Russia. And so in this regard, Russia is complying with its arms control obligations and transparency commitments to make those notifications, and so that is something that we will continue to keep an eye on.\"\n\nWATCH: Ukraine warns Russia may be plotting dirty bomb attack\n\nAt the State Department, spokesman Ned Price said the notification was \"important\" even as \"Russia engages in unprovoked aggression and reckless nuclear rhetoric.\"\n\n\"These notification measures do ensure that we are not taken by surprise and reduce the risks of misperception,\" he said.\n\nNeither the Pentagon nor the State Department offered details about the Russian notification, which came as Russia accuses Ukraine of plotting to use a dirty bomb on its own territory, a move the Kremlin says could lead to nuclear retaliation.",

Its very rare and different from general clotting conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or lung clots (pulmonary embolism).\n\nTTS is currently being investigated as a rare side effect of adenovirus based covid-19 vaccines, which use a weakened virus to trigger an immune response against coronavirus, but no clear evidence exists on the comparative safety of different types of vaccines.\n\nTo address this knowledge gap, an international team of researchers set out to compare the risk of TTS or thromboembolic events associated with use of adenovirus based covid-19 vaccines with mRNA based covid-19 vaccines.\n\nTheir findings are based on routinely collected health data for over 10 million adults in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the US who received at least one dose of a covid-19 vaccine (Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) from December 2020 to mid-2021.\n\nTo minimise possible error, participants were matched by age and sex and a range of other potentially influential factors such as pre-existing conditions and medication use were taken into account.\n\nThe researchers then compared rates of thrombosis and of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia between the adenovirus vaccines (Oxford-AstraZeneca or Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) and the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) within 28 days after vaccination.\n\nOverall, 1.3 million first dose Oxford-AstraZeneca recipients were matched to 2.1 million Pfizer-BioNTech recipients from Germany and the UK.\n\nAn additional, 762,517 people receiving Janssen/Johnson & Johnson were matched to 2.8 million receiving Pfizer-BioNTech in Germany, Spain, and the US, and all 628,164 Janssen/Johnson & Johnson recipients from the US were matched to 2.2 million Moderna recipients.\n\nA total of 862 thrombocytopenia events were found in the matched first dose Oxford-AstraZeneca recipients from Germany and the UK, and 520 events after a first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\nWhen the data were pooled together, analysis showed a 30% increased risk of thrombocytopenia after a first dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca compared with Pfizer-BioNTech an absolute risk difference of 8.21 per 100,000 recipients.\n\nAn increase in risk, albeit not statistically significant, of venous thrombosis with thrombocytopenia was observed after a first vaccine dose of Janssen/Johnson & Johnson compared with Pfizer-BioNTech. But the researchers say this finding needs to be replicated in other studies before any firm conclusions can be drawn.\n\nNo differential risk of thrombocytopenia was seen after a second dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca compared with a second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech. Similarly, no increased risk of thrombocytopenia was noted after Janssen/Johnson & Johnson compared with a first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\nThis is an observational study, and the researchers acknowledge that the rarity of the condition and incomplete vaccine records may have affected the results. Whats more, they cant rule out the possibility that some of the observed risk may have been due to other unmeasured (confounding) factors.\n\nHowever, this was a well-designed study that allowed comparison of available vaccines with each other, rather than with no vaccination, and the results were consistent after additional analyses, suggesting that they withstand scrutiny.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first multinational analysis of the comparative safety of adenovirus based compared with mRNA based covid-19 vaccines,\" say the authors.\n\n\"Although these events are very rare, absolute numbers of affected patients could become substantial owing to the large numbers of vaccine doses administered worldwide,\" they warn.\n\nAs such, they suggest that the observed risks after adenovirus based vaccines \"should be considered when planning further immunisation campaigns and future vaccine development.\"\n\n[Ends]\n\nNotes for editors\n\nResearch: Comparative risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or thromboembolic events associated with different covid-19 vaccines: international network cohort study from five European countries and the US doi: 10.1136/bmj-2022-071594\n\nJournal: The BMJ\n\nFunding: European Medicines Agency\n\nLink to Academy of Medical Sciences press release labelling system:\n\nhttps://press.psprings.co.uk/AMSlabels.pdf\n\nExternally peer reviewed?

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN\n\nThe world rejected sham referendums Russia used to justify annexing four Ukrainian regions, and its military has been beaten back from key parts of the areas.\n\nBut Russia now views the areas as \"inalienable parts of the Russian Federation,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday.\n\nPaired with Russian President Vladimir Putins suggestion last month that Russia is ready to use its nuclear arsenal to protect its territory, it seems Russia now believes the sphere protected by its nuclear weapons includes these parts of Ukraine.\n\nBack when Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the Texas A&M University professor Matthew Fuhrmann told me the likelihood of Putin actually using a nuclear weapon was low. Along with Todd Sechser, Fuhrmann wrote the 2017 book, \"Nuclear Weapons and Coercive Diplomacy.\"\n\nI called Fuhrmann to ask if this new rhetoric has changed things, if Putin is rational and to get a better sense of what we know about the so-called tactical nuclear weapons Russia could theoretically use. Our conversation, edited for length, is below.\n\nWhat has changed since the war began?\n\nWOLF: How have the last six months changed your impression of the worldwide nuclear threat?\n\nFUHRMANN: Certainly in the last few weeks and months, weve seen Russia continuing to try and play the nuclear card as a way to gain leverage over the West and especially the United States. The continued insertion of nuclear threats into the crisis has made me and others think more about the possibility of nuclear escalation.\n\nMembers of a local electoral commission count ballots at a polling station in Crimea on September 27 following a referendum on the joining of Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to Russia. Alexey Pavlishak/Reuters\n\nOn top of that, weve seen Russia resort to other policies, like conscripting additional forces and openly targeting civilians in Ukraine, that raise questions about other things it might be willing to do down the road should things escalate further. So were in an environment now where a lot of people are very much thinking about the nuclear dimension here.\n\nBiden thinks Putin is rational. Using a nuke would be irrational\n\nWOLF: President Joe Biden recently described Putin as a \"rational actor\" who miscalculated, but I think theres something irrational about even threatening the use of nuclear weapons. What did you make of what Biden said? And do you think that Putin right now is acting rationally?\n\nFUHRMANN: I do think hes a rational actor. A rational actor just means youre making decisions based on a calculation of costs and benefits.\n\nSo someone can be rational and make decisions that we think are risky or problematic. But as long as theyre making those decisions on the basis of some means and calculation, factoring in costs and benefits, then I would still characterize them as a rational actor.\n\nHow could Putin possibly benefit from a nuclear strike?\n\nWOLF: Theres been a lot of skepticism that Putin would actually cross the line and use some kind of nuclear weapon. He would need to frame it as a defensive measure or as a response to a strike on the Russian homeland. Is there anything specifically with regard to that idea of a cost/benefit analysis that suggests it would be worth it for him to use nuclear weapons?\n\nFUHRMANN: I think the probability of Russia using nuclear weapons right now is still relatively low. I might put it slightly higher than I would have in late February, when the when the conflict was first picking up, but I still think its relatively low.\n\nThe reason is that you have to think about what Putin would gain from using nuclear weapons as well as what the cost would be. And the costs are potentially enormous.\n\nWhat were probably talking about here would be the use of a tactical nuclear weapon something with a lower yield, that will result in fewer casualties, less radioactive contamination compared to a larger strategic weapon.\n\nEven still, the cost will be tremendous. And the benefits of doing so for Putin are also not totally clear.\n\nIf he wants to occupy Ukraine, it doesnt make much sense to destroy territory that he wants to claim for Russia.\n\nThe likelihood he would do so is still relatively low, but its not zero.\n\nRussian soldiers walk to Red Square during a rehearsal on May 7 for a military parade marking the 77th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nA nuclear message\n\nWOLF: What are potential scenarios?\n\nFUHRMANN: More than using a nuclear weapon on the battlefield, what he might be more likely to do would be some kind of nuclear detonation in the middle of nowhere as a signal to tell the United States and the West, hey, back off. If there was going to be nuclear weapon use, thats the scenario where I think it would be most likely based on the way things have gone so far.\n\nTactical vs. strategic\n\nWOLF: You just made a distinction between a tactical nuclear weapon and a strategic nuclear weapon. It seems like youre crossing a line no matter what kind of nuclear weapon you use.\n\nFURHMANN: Youre definitely crossing a line no matter what kind of nuclear weapon you use. Thats true.\n\nBut its also true that theres huge variation in terms of the kinds of nuclear weapons and the damage that they can inflict, and I think that that variation is important.\n\nA larger strategic warhead like the ones the United States uses on intercontinental ballistic missiles if its detonated in a big city that can kill 100,000 people or more. That is different than a smaller tactical nuclear weapon that if it was targeted in a populated area could kill maybe a few thousand.\n\nBoth events would, of course, be terrible and catastrophic. But I think there is a distinction between those two kinds of things.\n\nHow would a tactical nuclear weapon ruin the environment?\n\nWOLF: What would be the lasting environmental effect of even a tactical nuclear weapon? How long before people could go back and live in an area where one was used?\n\nFUHRMANN: That would depend on a lot of factors. It would depend on the size of the warhead. It would depend on how far above the ground it was detonated.\n\nIf it was detonated right at ground level, that means something different than if its detonated a mile in the air. It would also depend on things like wind patterns.\n\nSo its difficult to make a blanket statement about what the effects would be. In general, yes, you would have to worry about the radioactive contamination of an area anytime a nuclear weapon was used. How bad it would be would be a function of those variables.\n\nVehicles drive past advertising boards, including panels displaying pro-Russian slogans, in Luhansk, Ukraine, on September 20. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nWhat do we know about Russias tactical nuclear stockpile?\n\nWOLF: Its my understanding that some tactical nuclear weapons can be very small and essentially deployed by an individual soldier.\n\nFUHRMANN: We dont know nearly as much about Russias tactical nuclear forces and what they have as we do about Russias strategic nuclear weapons.\n\nThats in part because a lot of the prominent arms control treaties that were concluded between the United States and Russia dealt with strategic nuclear weapons. Through those negotiations and treaties, we learned something about the stockpiles that each country possesses as far as strategic warheads go.\n\nBut theres been no comparable bilateral arms control dealing with tactical nuclear weapons. They do likely possess a range of different tactical nuclear weapons with different capabilities. It depends on the command and control procedures that are in place, but tactical nuclear weapons in general are much more portable than a strategic nuclear weapon. Theyre designed for use on the battlefield and so they can be fired by a single soldier.\n\nWhat are the signs Putin would be gearing up to use a nuclear weapon?\n\nWOLF: What would be a tell that Russians were going to get ready to use one of these? Would they fortify themselves in a specific way or clear out of an area?\n\nFUHRMANN: Tactical nuclear weapons, to my knowledge, are not presently deployed. If Russia was going to do this, it would probably want to do it in a way that was visible to the United States through satellite imagery and other means.\n\nYou could see, for example, weapons moving out of storage, and weapons moving to the frontlines. These are things that would be observable, in theory, by US satellites. And to my knowledge, we havent seen any of that happening yet.\n\nWhy dont treaties cover tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nWOLF: It seems strange, that we kind of dealt with the mutually assured destruction weapons (strategic nuclear weapons), but then theres this whole subgroup (tactical nuclear weapons) thats floating out there that countries dont have a lot of knowledge about.\n\nFUHRMANN: The emphasis was on the strategic weapons because these were the big weapons that could destroy cities. I think it was natural to focus attention on those as being potentially the most destructive and therefore the biggest threat.\n\nBut yes, tactical nuclear weapons are still very significant. And it would be useful to think about arms control in that context as well.\n\nWhat is the US stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nWOLF: Does the US still maintain tactical nuclear weapons? And what should people know about the American stockpile?\n\nFUHRMANN: During the Cold War, the United States had a fairly large stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons. It was believed that the only way to defend NATO in Europe from a Soviet attack was to have tactical nuclear weapons deployed that could be used, should Soviet troops try to advance into Western Europe.\n\nWhen the Cold War ended and the Soviet threat was dissipated, most of these weapons were dismantled or returned home. There are still some US tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. Not many. And theyre weapons that are militarily not all that useful. Compared to Russia, the United States has at this point, fewer tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nWill the US now reconsider its own tactical nuclear arsenal?\n\nWOLF: Will this current situation lead the US and NATO to rethink whether they should have more access to tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nFUHRMANN: I think probably some people in Washington are already thinking that the United States should be more equipped with a greater number of smaller-yield tactical weapons.\n\nEven before Russia invaded Ukraine, there were debates in Washington about whether the US should develop lower-yield weapons. It was feared that if Russia used one of the lower-yield tactical nuclear weapons that it possesses, the United States doesnt have anything comparable. So if it were going to retaliate, in a nuclear sense, it would have to use a bigger nuclear weapon, which could be seen as an asymmetric response.\n\nThere were some generally more hawkish commentators and policy analysts who, even before the Ukraine war, were pushing the United States to develop these lower-yield nuclear weapons. And ironically those arguments will gain weight if Russia continues to make nuclear threats.\n\nShould Russias posturing lead to an increase in the US arsenal?\n\nWOLF: Do you have a position on that? What do you think should happen?\n\nFUHRMANN: My feeling is that nuclear weapons are useful as invasion insurance and as a deterrent against very major threats to national security. I dont see them as terribly useful for blackmail or for other forms of political coercion.\n\nWith that view, the reason you would need a tactical nuclear weapon, low-yield, would be for battlefield use. I think that that opens a really dangerous precedent to start thinking about weapons that youre going to use on the battlefield.\n\nI think about nuclear weapons as a weapon of last resort that you would use to stave off an invasion or full occupation of your territory, not something youre going to use on a battlefield in a nonexistential type situation.\n\nAre these stockpiles secure?\n\nWOLF: I remember after 9/11, there was a lot of concern that the Russian stockpile in particular could be infiltrated or that we could see one of these tactical weapons used as a dirty bomb. Has that threat receded, or are we just not paying attention to it right now?\n\nFUHRMANN: In general, one problem with tactical nuclear weapons is that it is harder to secure them because theyre smaller. We know that there were some tense moments and in the US history with nuclear weapons in terms of worrying about its tactical forces falling into the wrong hands. Anytime theres a lot of political instability in an area where nuclear weapons are stored, there are always concerns about them potentially falling into the wrong hands.\n\nIn the United States there are security measures in place and safety measures that make it more difficult to use a nuclear weapon.\n\nWhat exactly Russia has as far as those safety and security procedures in place, Im not sure. But one would hope that they have something along the lines of what the United States has in that regard. That could make it more difficult for someone who can actually fire any tactical nuclear weapon, even if they could hypothetically get their hands on it.\n\nThe US can have an effect on the threat from Putin\n\nWOLF: What else should we know?\n\nFUHRMANN: A lot of people understandably want to know: Are nuclear weapons going to be used or could they be used by Putin in this conflict?\n\nThe United States, through its actions, influences that probability to a large degree. To the extent that the United States were to escalate its military involvement in the war, do anything to strike targets in Russia itself, do anything to put troops on the ground in an overt way and actually enter the conflict, all of those things would significantly increase the risk of nuclear escalation.\n\nHow should the US help Ukraine without tempting nuclear war?\n\nWOLF: At the same time, youre starting to hear more and more lawmakers, in particular Republicans, questioning military aid to Ukraine at all. What is the right way to strike that balance?\n\nFUHRMANN: Its a great question, and theres no silver bullet answer, but you can look at history to get some guidance.\n\nThroughout the Cold War, there were many episodes where nuclear powers were indirectly involved in conflict with each other. You can think, for example, about the Soviet Union and their invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. And the war that persisted there over the next 10 years.\n\nThe United States was covertly providing a lot of support to the mujahedeen fighting against the Soviets. Not unlike the aid that has been provided to Ukraine now. The Soviet Union was, for its part, doing things to provide aid in the Korean War.\n\nTheres a long history of nuclear powers indirectly fighting one another by providing aid to the country militarily engaged with a nuclear power. In none of those cases, so far, did it escalate to the nuclear level.\n\nThat doesnt mean it couldnt happen again in the future, but I think there is a line that countries have been willing to walk up to and that line appears to be providing covert support quietly to actors engaged in conflict with other nuclear powers but not openly entering the fray.",

Sputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Kremlin via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nOct 23 (Reuters) - Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday for the second time in three days and held a flurry of calls with three other counterparts from NATO countries.\n\nMoscow provided no details on the conversation with Austin, which came after the two men spoke on Friday for the first time since May. Its readouts on the other calls said Shoigu had said the situation in Ukraine was worsening.\n\n\"They discussed the situation in Ukraine which is rapidly deteriorating,\" the Russian defence ministry said of Shoigu's call with French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu. \"It is trending towards further uncontrolled escalation.\"\n\nShoigu spoke separately to Turkey's defence minister, Hulusi Akar, and Britain's Ben Wallace.\n\nShoigu's ministry said he had told his French, Turkish and British counterparts of Moscow's concern that Ukraine could detonate a \"dirty bomb\" - a device laced with radioactive material. Russia has provided no evidence to substantiate such a claim.\n\nPrevious Russian assertions that Ukraine might resort to using banned weapons such as biological arms have stirred concerns in the West that Moscow might be preparing to stage \"false flag\" attacks and blame them on Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon's readout of the call said Austin told Shoigu he \"rejected any pretext for Russian escalation.\" Austin also \"reaffirmed the value of continued communication.\"\n\nThe White House National Security Council in a statement said it rejected Shoigu's false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory.\n\n\"The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,\" it said.\n\nCHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION\n\nThere was no indication from the Russian side that the conversations had produced any positive results. They showed, however, that Russia and members of the U.S.-led NATO alliance are actively maintaining channels of communication at a time of rising international concern about a possible nuclear escalation.\n\nWith Russia reeling from successive defeats in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has said it would resort to nuclear weapons if necessary to defend its \"territorial integrity.\" U.S. President Joe Biden has said that the world is closer to \"Armageddon\" than at any time since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nNATO last week launched its annual nuclear deterrence exercise and has said it expects Russia to hold drills shortly to test the readiness of its own nuclear forces.\n\nA top Russian diplomat was quoted after the Shoigu-Austin call on Friday as saying that \"misunderstandings must be cleared up so that there are no accidents.\"\n\nLecornu after Sunday's call said he had reaffirmed France's desire for a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine, and that Paris refused to get drawn into any form of escalation.\n\nBritain said Wallace had \"refuted\" claims by Shoigu that Western countries were facilitating a plan by Kyiv to escalate the conflict.\n\nReporting by Reuters; Editing by Gareth Jones and Mark Porter\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

In a series of phone calls on Monday with NATO nations, Moscows top military commander, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, repeated the allegation.\n\nSuch a bomb is not a nuclear device; it has none of the explosive power of a nuclear weapon. But it is an effective weapon of terror, and the resulting radiological contamination can make several city blocks uninhabitable for a period of time. And because it involves nuclear material, it can often be confused, in public discussion, with an atomic weapon.\n\nThe flurry of phone calls between American, NATO and Russian officials came after more than six months in which communications were sparse. And the sudden frequency of the calls, and resultant warnings, reflected what American officials said was a greater level of concern about possible nuclear use by Russia than at any point during the war.\n\nIt came 60 years to the week after the Cuban Missile Crisis, whose lessons have been both studied and debated by President Bidens aides in recent weeks.

                "cc_text": "Illustration by Matt Field\n\nOn October 23, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that Ukraine was preparing to use a \"dirty bomb\"a weapon that uses conventional explosives laced with radioactive material. In a series of phone calls to his counterparts in France, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Shoigu said that he was \"concerned about possible provocations by Kyiv involving the use of a dirty bomb.\"\n\nWestern officials quickly rejected the notion that Ukraine was preparing any such \"false-flag operation\" that would blame Russia. NATOs secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, denounced the Russian accusations, telling Politico in an interview that \"The allegation that Ukraine is preparing to use dirty bombs in Ukraine is absurd.\" To dismiss any thoughts of wrongdoing, Ukraine requested that the IAEA, the UNs nuclear watchdog, inspect the two nuclear locations in Ukraine that were mentioned in Russias accusations. The inspections are intended to detect any possible undeclared nuclear activities and materials.\n\nNeutral bystanders also dismissed the likelihood and significance of a dirty bomb being used in Ukraine. Pavel Podvig, an independent expert on Russian nuclear forces, said on Twitter that any use of a dirty bomb in Ukraine would not change much on the ground, either militarily or politically. William Alberque, Director of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, noted that there was little reason for Ukraine to resort to such an extreme when it was already winning on the battlefield, saying that Ukraine would not \"risk everything by detonating a dirty bomb to simulate a tactical nuclear weapon and blame it on Russia.\"\n\nOfficials and experts seemed to agree that the dirty bomb episode was a distraction by Russia, though its exact motives are unclear. On Monday, NATOs Stoltenberg warned on Twitter that \"Russia must not use [this allegation] as a pretext for escalation.\"\n\nSpoke with ?? @SecDef & ?? @BWallaceMP about #Russias false claim that #Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. #NATO Allies reject this allegation. Russia must not use it as a pretext for escalation. We remain steadfast in our support for Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg (@jensstoltenberg) October 24, 2022\n\nTo be sure, it would be easy enough to get the raw materials for such a bomb; earlier in the war, looters raided a radiation monitoring laboratory at Chernobyl, reported the peer-reviewed journal Science. The lab contained dangerous materials such as the powerful radioactive isotopes used to calibrate instrumentsas well as intensely radioactive samples from the infamous Chernobyl reactor meltdown in 1986. These radioactive materials can be mixed with conventional explosives to form a dirty bomb, with potentially widespread contamination.\n\nThis is not the first time that there have been worries about dirty bombsto varying degrees. The effects of a dirty bomb depend on many variables, from the type of radioactive materials used, to the amount of smoke and debris in the air, to the proximity to the blast. In any case, the amount of land area that would be affected by a dirty bomb is a lot less than that of a nuclear bomb: A dirty bomb could spread radiation only over a few square miles, while a full-blown nuclear bomb would spread radiation over hundreds of square miles. The differences are so extreme that the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has written that \"A dirty bomb is in no way similar to a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nWhich is not to say that there is no cause for alarm. There would have been long-term medical repercussions if, for example, the Boston Marathon bombing had involved a dirty bomb, as George M. Moorescientist-in-residence at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Montereynoted in these pages in 2013: \"If the Boston marathon had been attacked with dirty bombs, hospitals would have received contaminated victims and patients with radioactive material embedded in them. Protocols for dealing with these problems could have led to delays and further loss of life.\"\n\nPerhaps the biggest take-away comes from a later Bulletin article written by Moore in 2019, in which he noted: \"The typical realistic scenario for a dirty bomb is certainly serious, but many experts believe that the immediate danger to people would be minimal: Its the explosion of a dirty bomb that would kill or injure people. On the other hand, the cleanup costs of an incident and other economic losses might be enormous. As a example, remember the cleanup costs associated with the post-9/11 anthrax letters.\"\n\nDespite its potential for harm, the scale of destruction from a dirty bomb is in no way comparable to the detonation of a tactical or strategic nuclear weapon. As Elisabeth Eaves noted in a 2016 Bulletin article: \"Dirty bombs have more in common with nuclear medicine than nuclear war\"",

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraines foreign minister, said he extended a formal invitation to U.N. nuclear inspectors to independently establish that Ukraine has \"nothing to hide.\"\n\nThe Washington Post could not verify either sides claim. The Institute for the Study of War said that \"the Kremlin is unlikely to be preparing an imminent false-flag dirty bomb attack.\" Instead, the think tank noted, \"Shoigu likely sought to slow or suspend Western military aid to Ukraine and possibly weaken the NATO alliance\" with his allegations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe incident has thrown Western and Ukrainian fears of a Russian nuclear attack into sharp relief, as the conflict hits the eight-month mark Monday, and frustrations grow within Russia that what officials initially conceived as a quick victory is turning into a protracted and costly conflict.\n\nFor many, it has also raised the question: What is a dirty bomb?\n\nDirty bombs are made of conventional explosives and radioactive material, designed to spread the material once they explode. They are not nuclear weapons and bear no resemblance to the atomic bombs used by the United States in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Dirty bombs are far less powerful: Their \"radiation could be dispersed within a few blocks or miles of the explosion,\" according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.\n\nAs the department notes, the explosive substance in a dirty bomb is more likely to cause harm to humans than the radioactive material it carries. The goal of using a dirty bomb may not be maximal destruction, but rather an attempt to \"create fear and panic, contaminate property, and require potentially costly cleanup,\" it explains.\n\nShoigus claims that Ukraine would use a dirty bomb are particularly sensitive because Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for a guarantee from Russia that it would not attack Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussias claims also come as analysts say the war in Ukraine has entered a new chapter one that has seen Russia face several military losses, including Ukrainian gains in the south and the explosion that damaged the Crimean Bridge, which links Crimea to mainland Russia.\n\nMoscow has retaliated forcefully, with massive strikes against Ukraines capital and its energy infrastructure ahead of winter. But Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing increasingly vocal criticism at home, as a growing number of war propagandists bemoan a perceived lack of progress and thousands of Russian men flee their country to avoid being forced to fight in Ukraine.\n\nSetbacks in its invasion of Ukraine have led to increased nuclear threats by Russia, echoing Cold War events like the little-known 1983 nuclear crisis. (Video: Joshua Carroll/The Washington Post)\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Putin has threatened to use \"all means available\" to defend Russian-occupied territory. \"I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all means at our disposal,\" Putin said Sept. 21. \"This is not a bluff.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after that, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russias Security Council, wrote on Telegram that \"Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons if necessary.\" But he said Russia would do so only \"in predetermined cases\" laid out in its nuclear-policy documents.\n\nCIA Director William J. Burns told CBS News last month that it was difficult to assess how serious Putin is about the potential use of nuclear weapons. He said the U.S. intelligence community has not seen \"any practical evidence\" that there is an \"imminent threat.\" Still, he said the United States should take the comments \"very seriously.\"\n\nU.S. officials previously told The Washington Post that the United States for several months has been privately warning Russias leadership of the grave consequences that would follow the use of a nuclear weapon. Recent, more specific statements from Moscow appear to have set off alarm bells in Western countries and in Ukraine.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWhen asked about Putins nuclear threats, Col. Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of Ukraines ground forces, told ABC News in an interview released Monday, \"We are and should be worried.\"",

Ukraine does not possess nuclear weapons, while Russia has said it could protect Russian territory with its nuclear arsenal.\n\nA Russian missile strike on Sunday wiped out the top floor of an apartment block in Mykolaiv, sending shrapnel and debris across a plaza and into neighboring buildings, smashing windows and cracking walls. Cars were crushed under rubble, Reuters witnessed. No fatalities were recorded.\n\n\"After the first blast, I tried to get out, but the door was stuck.

We only responded with hints to (nuclear threats from) from Western leaders,\"\n\nPutin said, accusing Western governments, including former British Prime Minister Liz Truss, of engaging in \"nuclear blackmail\" against Russia.\n\nHe also accused the West of \"forcing the thesis that Russia will use nuclear weapons\" to influence neutral countries against Moscow. He stressed that Russias military doctrine only allows the use of nuclear weapons for \"defense\" purposes.\n\nPutin also reiterated Russias baseless claims that Ukraine was building a dirty bomb to use on its own territory and blame Moscow for it.\n\nRussia has been accusing Ukraine of planning to use a so-called dirty bomb, which combines conventional explosives like dynamite and radioactive material such as uranium. Kyiv and its Western allies say there is no truth to the accusation and that Moscow could be mounting a false-flag operation.\n\nUkraine has invited experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit two facilities the Russian government says without evidence are involved in a plan to create a dirty bomb.\n\nMore background: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the consequences for Russia if it uses a nuclear weapon in its war on Ukraine have been conveyed to Putin.\n\nBlinken also denounced Russias latest claim that Ukraine is considering the use of a \"dirty bomb\" as \"another fabrication and something that is also the height of irresponsibility coming from a nuclear power.\" Blinken reiterated that the US is tracking the Kremlins nuclear saber-rattling \"very carefully,\" but hasnt \"seen any reason to change our nuclear posture.\"\n\nDespite Putins rhetoric, Russian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Andrey Kelin told CNN Wednesday that Russia will not use nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine.\n\nHowever, actions taken by Moscow in recent weeks the \"dirty bomb\" allegations, attacks on civilian infrastructure, looming defeats on the battlefield, and its annual military exercise have increased concerns, a senior administration official said.\n\nThis official told CNN that the potential collapse of parts of Russias military in Ukraine could be the factor that could cause Putin to turn to nuclear weapon use. As such, the US is keeping a close eye on the developments in the Kherson region, where its not easy for Russian soldiers to retreat.\n\nRussia informed the US of its annual GROM exercise, which includes its strategic nuclear forces, the Pentagon said.

                "cc_text": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) Ukrainian forces attacked Russias hold on the southern city of Kherson on Thursday while fighting intensified in the countrys east. The battles came amid reports that Moscow-appointed authorities have abandoned the city, joining tens of thousands of residents who fled to other Russia-held areas.\n\nUkrainian forces were surrounding Kherson from the west and attacking Russias foothold on the west bank of the Dnieper River, which divides the region and the country.\n\nAs the battles unfolded, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow has no intention to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, despite issuing repeated warnings in the past that he was prepared to use all available means to defend Russia, including its nuclear arsenal.\n\n\"We see no need for that,\" Putin said at a conference of international foreign policy experts outside Moscow. \"There is no point in that, neither political nor military.\"\n\nThe Russian leader, who insisted for weeks before the invasion that he did not intend to attack Ukraine, also sought to cast the conflict as part of efforts by the West to secure global domination. He accused the U.S. and its allies of trying to dictate their terms to other nations in a \"dangerous and bloody\" domination game.\n\nPutin, whose troops invaded on Feb. 24, has described Western support for Ukraine as part of broad efforts by Washington and its allies to enforce what they call a rules-based world order that only foments chaos.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia warned that Moscow could target Western commercial satellites used for military purposes in support of Ukraine, and a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the United States of pursuing \"thoughtless and mad\" escalation.\n\nSpokeswoman Maria Zakharova argued that Washington should take an approach more like it did during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, when the Cold War superpowers stepped back from the brink of nuclear confrontation.\n\n\"The more the U.S. is drawn into supporting the Kyiv regime on the battlefield, the more they risk provoking a direct military confrontation between the biggest nuclear powers fraught with catastrophic consequences,\" Zakharova said.\n\nUkraine has pushed ahead with an offensive to reclaim the Kherson region and its capital of the same name, which Russian forces captured during the first days of a war now in its ninth month.\n\nMore than 70,000 residents from the Kherson city area have evacuated in recent days, the regions Kremlin-installed governor, Vladimir Saldo, said Thursday.\n\nMembers of the Russia-backed regional administration also fled, the deputy governor, Kirill Stremousov said. Monuments to Russian heroes were moved, along with the remains of Grigory Potemkin, the Russian general who founded Kherson in the 18th century. His remains were kept at the citys St. Catherines Church.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described reports of Russian troops possible withdrawal from the city as disinformation.\n\n\"I dont see them fleeing from Kherson,\" Zelenskyy said in an interview with Italys Corriere della Sera newspaper. \"This is an information attack, so that we go there, transfer troops from other dangerous directions there.\"\n\nZelenskyy also dismissed as \"theater\" recent attempts by local Kremlin-backed officials to persuade the citys civilian residents to relocate deeper into Russian-held territory ahead of the Ukrainian advance.\n\n\"Their most trained soldiers are in position. We see this and do not believe them,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, Russian forces continued to bombard the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, making slow gains toward the center.\n\nThe deputy head of Russias delegation at a U.N. arms control panel, Konstantin Vorontsov, described the use of U.S. and other Western commercial satellites for military purposes during the fighting as \"extremely dangerous.\"\n\n\"The quasi-civilian infrastructure could be a legitimate target for a retaliatory strike,\" Vorontsov warned.\n\nAs they have all month, Russian forces carried out attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure that have caused increasing worry ahead of winter.\n\nA Russian drone attack early Thursday hit an energy facility near the capital of Kyiv, causing a fire, said Kyiv regional Gov. Oleksiy Kuleba. He said the latest attacks inflicted \"very serious damage.\"\n\nKuleba announced new rolling blackouts and urged consumers to save power. He said authorities were still pondering how to restore service.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraines presidential office, said rolling blackouts would also be introduced in the neighboring Chernihiv, Cherkasy and Zhytomyr regions.\n\nZelenskyy has said that Russian attacks have already destroyed 30% of the countrys energy infrastructure.\n\nIn a likely response to Russias assaults on Ukrainian infrastructure, a drone attacked a power plant just outside Sevastopol, a port in the Russian-annexed region of Crimea. The plant sustained minor damage, according to city leader Mikhail Razvozhayev. He said electricity supplies were uninterrupted.\n\nCrimea was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. It has faced drone attacks and explosions amid the fighting in Ukraine. In a major setback for the Kremlin, a powerful truck bomb blew up a section of a strategic bridge linking Crimea to Russias mainland on Oct. 8.\n\nA senior Ukrainian military officer accused Russia of planning to stage explosions at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and blame them on Ukraine in a false-flag attack.\n\nGen. Oleksii Gromov, the chief of the main operational department of the Ukrainian militarys general staff, pointed to Moscows repeated unfounded allegations that Ukraine was plotting to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb as a possible signal that Moscow was planning explosions at the plant, Europes largest nuclear power station.\n\nRussia took control of the Zaporizhzhia plant in the opening days of the invasion. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of attacking the plant, which had its reactors shut down following continuous shelling.\n\nElsewhere, Ukrainian authorities reported that another mass grave was discovered in territory recently reclaimed from Russia. It contained up to 17 bodies of soldiers and civilians.\n\nThe Ukrainian Interior Ministry said in a statement that police found the grave outside the city of Izium after being tipped off by local residents.\n\nThe statement cited locals as saying that Russian troops dumped bodies in a pit outside the nearby village of Kopanky in mid-April, then leveled the ground with tanks.\n\nIn other developments, Ukrainian authorities said they were launching a criminal case against Russias childrens rights commissioner, accusing her of enabling the abduction and forced adoption of thousands of vulnerable Ukrainian children.\n\nMaria Lvova-Belova said this week that she herself has adopted a boy seized by the Russian army in the bombed-out city of Mariupol.\n\nLast month, she was sanctioned by the U.S., U.K. and other Western nations over allegations that she masterminded the removal of over 2,000 vulnerable children from the embattled Donetsk and Luhansk region in Ukraines east. According to Ukraine, she orchestrated a new policy to facilitate their forced placement with \"foster families\" in Russia.\n\nZelenskyy ended the day on an emotional note, pointing out in his nightly address to the nation that Ukraine on Friday marks the anniversary of its liberation from the Nazis in World War II. This year, he said, the holiday carries special significance.\n\n\"Evil always ends the same way. The occupier becomes a capitulator, the invader a fugitive. War criminals become defendants. Aggression becomes a court verdict. Destruction turns into reparations. Enemy equipment becomes museum exhibits,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n___\n\nFollow APs coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

                "cc_text": "Securing High-Containment Biological Labs Can Avert Next Pandemic\n\nChemical and biological weapons had become the best alternative to nuclear weapons for rogue States and non-State actors, the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) heard today as it concluded its thematic debate on weapons of mass destruction and opened debate on conventional weapons.\n\nThe path to chemical and biological weapons was easier and cheaper than developing a nuclear bomb, said Myanmars representative. The \"poor mans atomic bomb\" could be created using equipment and materials that had a host of civilian applications. He urged the international community to tighten its grip on their proliferation and added a call to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention. Its lack of a verification system weakened its effectiveness and relevance.\n\nDeeply concerned about the risk, Indias representative tabled its annual resolution on the dangers of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the potential for their exploitation by non-State actors (document A/77/C.1/L.60). The text urged support for international efforts to combat that threat, as well as strengthen national measures. India had a robust national exportcontrol system and a control list of sensitive material, equipment and technologies consistent with the highest international standards.\n\nSimilarly, the representative of Bangladesh expressed concern over the growing possibility of terrorists and other non-State actors using or gaining access to weapons of mass destruction. The COVID-19 pandemic had revealed global vulnerability to the potentially catastrophic consequences of pathogens and other biological threats, he said, calling for an international body mandated to investigate suspected outbreaks of biological agents.\n\nIndeed, said Pakistans speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic had laid bare the fragilities of the global public health architecture, including the intersecting issues of life sciences, viruses and infectious diseases. There were important lessons for the Biological Weapons Convention regime from the pandemic, such as the mutually reinforcing nature of its prevention and protection aspects, as well as the urgency of amplifying international assistance and cooperation in the field of life sciences.\n\n\"We have witnessed and experienced the catastrophe of a pandemic and we cannot afford to have another,\" the representative of Sri Lanka said. He sought a harmonized international regime that ensured biosafety and biosecurity. Confidence-building measures among States would facilitate greater informationexchange within the research community and create trust for a verifiable common standard against biological weapons.\n\nDual-use material was worrying, agreed Colombias representative, who supported bolstering biological control mechanism to prevent access and weaponization by non-State actors. She advocated for international cooperation in the field of biocontainment to enhance capacity to prevent and respond to those types of threats, asserting that the pandemic had highlighted the need to safeguard that material for strictly peaceful use.\n\nWhile biological weapons were \"poorly regulated\", chemical weapons were under intense scrutiny, said Brazils speaker. It was unfortunate that, even with all the institutional apparatuses, \"much to his revulsion\", chemical weapons were still used.\n\nAlgerias representative said that the Chemical Weapons Convention had made progress, but faced challenges at all levels in todays changing world. He welcomed reductions in chemical weapons stockpiles, but said divisions among States parties were concerning.\n\nAlso speaking on weapons of mass destruction were representatives of China, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Spain, Republic of Korea, Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Trkiye, Japan, Cuba, Hungary, Syria, Israel, Ireland, Angola, Ukraine and Iran.\n\nExercising the right of reply were representatives of the Russian Federation, United States, Syria and Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking on the theme of conventional weapons were representatives of Cambodia (on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)), Mexico, Canada, Egypt, Finland and Norway.\n\nThe Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on Thursday, 20 October, to continue his thematic debate on conventional weapons.\n\nWeapons of Mass Destruction\n\nSOON YEE LIANG ( China ) said that strengthening the Biological Weapons and Chemical Weapons Conventions were ever more important for maintaining international peace and security and promoting economic and social development. Parties should practice true multilateralism and uphold the purposes and objectives of the two Conventions and safeguard their authority and effectiveness. The United States should provide in-depth clarifications on the allegations made by the Russian Federation, as well as questions raised by China and other States, and set an example of compliance to win the international community's confidence in its compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention.\n\nHe urged States parties to utilize the Biological Weapons Conventions mechanism, including relevant arrangements under the Treatys article VI. He called on them to ensure the right of developing countries to peaceful uses of biotechnology. The United States, as the only country in the world with chemical weapons stockpiles, should earnestly fulfil its obligations and expedite the destruction of its stockpiles. Recently, China and Japan invited the Director General and the delegation of the Executive Council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to visit China virtually and advise on ways to speed up the destruction of abandoned Japanese chemical weapons. The representative urged Japan to honour its commitment. The practice of disregarding communication and consultations among States parties severely undermined the authority and effectiveness of the Chemical Weapons Convention and negatively impacted the OPCWs normal operation.\n\nKHALIL HASHMI ( Pakistan ) expressed concern about the possibility of the acquisition, production and use of chemical and biological materials as well as technology by non-State actors and, in some cases, by States as well. He agreed that sensitive technologies and materials should be adequately regulated to guard against any use incompatible with the two Conventions. However, that objective should not justify impediments to the legitimate use of biological or chemical sciences, equipment and technology among States parties for peaceful purposes. It was vital to restore balance and even-handedness in the implementation of the export control regimes. Non-discriminatory implementation of the Conventions, national physical protection and international assistance and cooperation were key tools to prevent non-State actors acquisition production, or use of those weapons.\n\nHe said that the COVID19 pandemic had laid bare the fragilities of the global public health architecture, including the intersecting issues of life sciences, viruses, and infectious diseases. There were important lessons for the Biological Weapons Convention regime from the pandemic, such as the mutually reinforcing nature of its prevention and protection aspects, as well as the urgency of amplifying international assistance and cooperation in the field of life sciences. He remained committed to the full, effective and balanced implementation of that Convention. Neither the Secretary-Generals mechanism, nor voluntary confidence-building measures could substitute for the widely supported proposal to conclude a legally binding verification protocol. He added the importance of avoiding distortions in the OPCWs mandate, which might render it susceptible to political manoeuvring.\n\nKONSTANTIN VORONTSOV ( Russian Federation ) said that the Biological Weapons Convention was a reliable tool for reducing that threat. The treatys utmost effectiveness could best be achieved through its full implementation by all States parties and by adopting a legally binding protocol establishing a credible and efficient verification mechanism. In order to address the implementation issues by the United States and Ukraine with reference to the military and biological activities in the Ukrainian territory, the Russian Federation initiated a Consultative Meeting of States parties. His country had not received exhaustive answers to the submitted detailed specific claims regarding those States' compliance with the Conventions articles I and IV. Thus, the issues were pending, as were the solutions.\n\nHe said the Russian Federation had fulfilled its obligations, in good faith, under the Chemical Weapons Convention. In 2017, it destroyed one of the largest arsenals of chemical weapons, three years ahead of the Organisations deadline. He urged the United States, which had the financial and technological capacity to eliminate the remaining stockpiles of toxic substances as quickly as possible, to follow the Russian Federation example. European allies led by the United States were deliberately pursuing a destructive policy of further politicizing the OPCW, which was technical in nature.\n\nMr. KHANDKER ( Bangladesh ), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, expressed concern over the growing possibility of terrorists and other non-State actors using or gaining access to weapons of mass destruction. Stressing the importance of the full and non-discriminatory implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, he detailed his countrys compliance, but spotlighted the use of those weapons in recent years. He called on the international community to unite in condemning that and holding those responsible in a transparent manner. Further, the credibility and integrity of OPCW must be upheld to enable it to deliver on its mandate. Bangladesh cooperated with it to promote the peaceful use of chemicals and was the first member to have introduce chemical-incident preparedness measures for hospitals. He noted that the COVID19 pandemic revealed global vulnerability to the potentially catastrophic consequences of pathogens and other biological threats, urging the full, effective and non-discriminatory implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention. He added a call to establish an international body mandated to investigate suspected outbreaks of biological agents.\n\nFLAVIO DAMICO ( Brazil ) said the mere existence of weapons of mass destruction shocked the conscience and challenged international humanitarian law. Brazil favoured the resumption of negotiations regarding a multilateral mechanism to verify compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which would foster trust regarding the exclusively peaceful use of knowledge and technology in the field of life science. While biological weapons were poorly regulated, chemical weapons were under intense scrutiny. It was unfortunate that even with all the institutional apparatus, much to his revulsion, chemical weapons were still used. He pledged his countrys unyielding support for the OPCW and hoped it could overcome the politization that undermined its culture of consensus. Of special concern was the possibility of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of non-State actors, particularly terrorists. In that, Council resolution 1540 (2004) was a valuable tool. Spotlighting the new risks of proliferation and rapid advances in science, technology, and commerce, he reiterated that changes in resolution 2325 (2016) should not impede access to sensitive and dual-use goods and technologies for peaceful purposes.\n\nMOHAMED ENNADIR LARBAOUI ( Algeria ) said that the Biological and Chemical Weapons Conventions were key milestones and served as a framework for socioeconomic development. He called on countries to accede to both Treaties without delay. The Biological Weapons Convention required balanced implementation to achieve its objectives. Legally binding instruments were the best way to ensure States adherence. The upcoming Review Conference is an opportunity to strengthen the instrument. The Convention facilitated technical development for peaceful uses of that material by developing countries and assisted them in responding swiftly to biological threats. The Chemical Weapons Convention had made progress but faced challenges on all levels in todays changing world. He welcomed its accomplishments in reducing chemical weapons stockpiles, which showed Member States robust trust in the regime. Divisions between States parties, however, remained a source of concern. He called for collective action to ensure their right to the relevant technology for peaceful use and underlined the importance of Council resolution 1540 (2004). It was crucial to articulate a balance between peaceful use for socioeconomic development and protection against misuse.\n\nAIDAN LIDDLE ( United Kingdom ) said that upholding the complete ban on chemical and biological weapons remained crucial for international peace and security. The United Kingdom called on all States to adhere to the Conventions. It was unacceptable that the Russian Federation spread false narratives and disinformation about those weapons in Ukraine. He warned that country that any use would be met with severe consequences. The pandemic demonstrated the importance of bolstering the global biosecurity regime. States parties must seize the opportunity at the ninth review of that Convention to strengthen it.\n\nHe noted that the Secretary-Generals Mechanism for Investigation was the sole instrument available to investigate alleged use of chemical weapons by non-States parties. Consequently, the United Kingdom would not support proposals that undermined its mandate or independence. The Russian Federation should answer questions regarding the Alexei Navalny and Salisbury cases and declare all its chemical weapons. Syria had obstructed the OPCWs work and should comply with the Convention and Council resolution 2118 (2013). The OPCW should conduct its work free from disinformation or assaults on its integrity. He underlined his support for the Global Partnership against the spread of mass destruction weapons and related material, as well as the need for the Council to reaffirm resolution 1540 (2004). The world must redouble its effects to uphold the ban on the use and spread of those horrific weapons, he concluded.\n\nSUGEESHWARA GUNARATNA ( Sri Lanka ), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, underlined the need to achieve universal implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and to prevent access to such weapons by non-State actors. Any allegation regarding their use must be addressed pursuant to the Convention. Turning to the Biological Weapons Convention, he said that, while it was a vital component of the legal architecture to combat weapons of mass destruction, the lack of a verification system continued to challenge its effective implementation. \"What is sought is a harmonized international regime that ensures biosafety and biosecurity,\" he stressed, also underlining the need to improve the security of high-containment biological laboratories. \"We have witnessed and experienced the catastrophe of a pandemic and we cannot afford to have another.\" Confidence-building measures among States would facilitate greater information exchange within the research community, while also creating trust for a verifiable common standard against biological weapons. His country understood the danger of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of non-State actors, and it continued to implement Security Council resolution 1540 (2004).\n\nFLIX BAUMANN ( Switzerland ) said that chemical weapons use was incompatible with maintaining public order. The last reports of OPCW investigation and fact-finding missions showed compelling arguments that the Syrian Army used chemical weapons. Their use was reprehensible, and all perpetrators should be held accountable. He called on Syria to fully cooperate with OPCW. He commended the OPCWs professionalism and voiced full respect for its mandate. Pointing to the effects of the pandemic, he warned that deliberate dissemination of biological agents could have the same result. The Biological Weapons Convention should be strengthened, and Switzerland stood ready to particate in discussions on a legally binding instrument to beef up the Convention. Similarly, the Secretary-Generals Mechanism must be strengthened and its independence ensured. He underscored that the Russian Federations allegations against Ukraine regarding the use of biological and chemical weapons did not amount to violations under either Convention. Switzerland condemned any groundless allegations that threatened the global order, the Conventions or international cooperation.\n\nALBERTO MIRANDA DE LA PEA ( Spain ), aligning himself with the European Union, stressed that the paradigm of global security architecture had changed completely, as the Russian Federations unjust, unprovoked and illegal war against Ukraine constitutes a grave violation of the Charter. Turning to the Biological Weapons Convention, he noted that its imminent ninth Review Conference was an excellent opportunity to design an ambitious inter-sessional programme to strengthen the treatys implementation. He hoped that States would find the political will to equip the Convention with a verification mechanism and promote universalization. On the Chemical Weapons Convention, he said that instrument was a multilateral achievement eliminating an entire class of weapons, and, thanks to the OPCW, it had been possible to eliminate certain chemical arsenals. However, the recent use of those weapons both in armed conflict and for assassination was worrying. There was no room for impunity in that regard, and all cases must be clarified through transparent investigation. He called on all States to abide by their regulations under Council resolution 1540 (2004).\n\nSUNGHOON KIM ( Republic of Korea ) said that the international communitys achievement since the Chemical Weapons Conventions entry into force in 1997 was remarkable. More than 98 per cent of all declared chemical weapons had been destroyed. The remaining would be destroyed by September 2023 and verified by the OPCW. However, concerns remained over the threat posed by the repeated use of those weapons. She was deeply concerned that the cooperation to address all outstanding issues between Syria and the OPCW Technical Secretariat had been seriously hampered. She urged Syria to immediately take necessary actions to redress the situation and comply with the Convention. She attached great importance to establishing an independent, transparent, and inclusive science and technology review mechanism and saw it necessary to set voluntary guiding principles for scientists and strengthen bio-risk management standards.\n\nShe said the Republic of Korea was actively implementing obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention by submitting confidence-building measures reports, enacting domestic legislation, managing a reliable export control regime, and building operational capabilities. The representative expressed her deep concern about the Russian Federations unfounded allegations regarding the development and possible use of chemical or biological weapons, which might impede the full implementation of the Convention. He was also concerned that those might be precursors to the use of biological or chemical weapons.\n\nJAROSLAV TPNEK ( Czech Republic ), associating with the European Union, condemned the Russian Federations aggression, which had aggravated the risk of weapons of mass destruction. He also strongly condemned that countrys disinformation attempts about Ukraines alleged misuse of toxic chemicals. It must stop the \"disinformation fog,\" by which it tried to divert attention from its inadmissible actions. In fact, the pro-Russian Federation separatist forces had threatened chemical weapons use during the Azovstal siege. In addition, 11 cases of chemical weapons use in Syria had been established through OPCWs investigations, of which eight had attributed to the Syrian armed forces. The OPCW was not an accountability mechanism, so the United Nations should act now to ensure justice for the victims and end impunity. He urged the Russian Federation to acknowledge its poisoning of Sergei and Julia Skripal and Alexei Navalny and\n\nANUPAM RAY ( India ) said he was deeply concerned about the risk of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists and non-State actors. He supported strengthening of efforts through international cooperation and within the United Nations framework to address it. India has confronted terrorism for many decades. Its annual resolution on the subject focused on the dangers of weapons of mass destruction proliferation and the potential for their exploitation by terrorists and non-State actors. Tabled since 2002 and adopted by consensus, the resolution urged Member States to support international efforts, as well as to take and strengthen national measures, as appropriate, to prevent terrorists from acquiring mass destructive weapons and their delivery means. The representative was pleased that the last year had received the support of almost 92 sponsors and co-sponsors. India had enacted comprehensive domestic legislation and had a robust and effective national export control system based on legislation, regulations, and a control list of sensitive material, equipment and technologies consistent with the highest international standards.\n\nensure it was not repeated. Policy discourse should be based on objective and reliable scientific advice, and he supported a science advisory mechanism for the Biological Weapons Convention. The Review Conference must not be hijacked by the Russian Federations fabricated accusations.\n\nARSEN OMAROV ( Kazakhstan ) strongly condemned the existence of any weapons of mass destruction and called for their complete elimination, especially in light of rapidly developing technologies. He reaffirmed his commitment to Biological Weapons Convention and would actively work with all States and relevant international organizations to achieve its goals and universalization. During the present General Assembly session, Kazakhstans President had introduced his proposal for establishing an international agency for biological safety and had received positive feedback. At the upcoming Biological Weapons Convention Review Conference, Kazakhstan would introduce a proposal for a working group, and he kindly requested States parties to join the initiative. Kazakhstan hoped to foster dialogue on the matter. The Convention on Chemical Weapons, the Geneva Protocol, and the Biological Weapons Convention were vital to guiding the international community in the struggle to overcome the existence of those weapons. He supported a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and hoped that the upcoming Conference would maintain the positive momentum. His country fulfilled its obligations under Council resolution 1540 (2004), especially regarding export controls on goods and technologies.\n\nMEMET MEVLT YAKUT( Trkiye ) condemned the re-emerging use of chemical weapons in certain parts of the world, noting that the case of Syria was \"particularly worrisome.\" That was the country where the bulk of serious violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention had occurred in the last decade and where the risk of recurring violations persisted. He underscored that the Syrian regime must comply with its obligations under the Convention, present an accurate declaration of all its stockpiles and production facilities, and completely destroy them. It must also cooperate with the OPCW, facilitating the work of its investigation teams rather than obstructing it. \"Impunity in Syria cannot simply be tolerated,\" he stressed. For its part, Trkiye supported efforts to ensure accountability for those responsible for chemical attacks. He also supported the integrity, independence and professionalism of the OPCW Technical Secretariat, expressing regret over increasing attempts to discredit it. He highlighted the importance of the Secretary-Generals Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons, which proved useful in 2013.\n\nICHIRO OGASAWARA ( Japan ) remained fully committed to multilateral efforts related to arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means. The repeated use of chemical weapons in recent years was serious, and the international community should be united in condemning it. He urged Syria to ensure accountability by addressing all outstanding issues. States parties to the Biological Weapons Convention had been constructively discussing possible measures to strengthen it. He commended the consultation mechanism for that purpose and cautioned against its abuse for political purposes with \"flimsy\" allegations. Further, he supported the concept of preserving and strengthening the Secretary-Generals Mechanism for investigating the alleged use of biological and chemical weapons, as that was the only available tool to independently investigate such cases.\n\nPEDRO LUIS PEDROSO CUESTA ( Cuba ), associating with the Non-Aligned Movement, supported the full, transparent and verifiable elimination of weapons of mass destruction, in line with his country foreign policy and Constitution. Cuba did not have, nor did it intend to possess, weapons of mass destruction and rejected their use by any actor. It was a founding signatory of the Biological Weapons Convention and had shown leadership in its implementation. He condemned the unilateral coercive measures aimed at preventing international science and technology cooperation and progress in the areas of biology and chemistry. He called for legally binding instruments and verification measures for biological and chemical weapons. He opposed the United States obstructive stance and rejected politically motivated actions at the upcoming Review Conferences. He called on the United States as the only possessor of those weapons to eliminate them, within the given period and subject to international verification. The upcoming reviews were appropriate places to show support for the full implementation of the Conventions. He hoped consensus would prevail over politization. Cuba would continue to seek a world free of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nGYRGY MOLNR ( Hungary ) took the floor to introduce the draft resolution on the Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons (document A/C.1/77/L.74). This year, the draft had technical updates, as well as a new preambular paragraph, concerning Article V, requested by the Russian Federation. Hungary wished to remain the texts sole sponsor. He hoped that the resolution would again be adopted by consensus as was the case every year. Through adoption, the international community reaffirmed its support for the prohibition of biological weapons and confirmed that the Convention was a fundamental pillar. Moreover, its adoption would send a positive signal to the upcoming ninth Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention.\n\nBASSAM SABBAGH ( Syria ) rejected the use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere and under any circumstances. In 2003, during its membership in the Security Council, Syria had tabled a draft resolution to establish a zone free from nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. The draft was obstructed by the United States. he reaffirmed that the main obstacle to the zones establishment was Israel's intransigence and its continued refusal to accede to treaties or agreements related to the prohibition and the non-proliferation of mass destruction weapons. That made Israel the main threat to peace and security in the region.\n\nIn the light of the serious threat that those weapons could be acquired by terrorists, he said Syria addressed hundreds of letters to the Secretary-General and the Committees tasked with combating terrorism. Those letters included important information about the acquisition by armed terrorist groups of chemical material and their use. There was a need to deal with the shortcomings of the relevant international instruments through the conclusion of an agreement to coordinate international efforts to defeat acts of biological and chemical terrorism. In that, he supported the Russian Federation draft agreement in the Conference on Disarmament on the matter. The international communitys failure to face the risks of the acquisition of those weapons by terrorists encouraged them to seek to acquire them.\n\nMAAYAN MICHAL ( Israel ) said that rogue States continued to challenge the foundations of arms control and non-proliferation. That began with the lack of commitment by States to fulfil their obligations in good faith and the persistence of blatant non-compliance with existing norms. The Middle East struggled with a chronic lack of compliance. That culture of non-compliance and disregard for international obligations and norms had become dangerous. The use of chemical weapons by States in the region against their own population and against neighbouring countries had occurred numerous times since the Second World War, in clear violation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol. Furthermore, two additional cases of regional Member States violating the Convention on Chemical Weapons still had outstanding questions to be investigated. Despite the chemical-weapon disarmament process in Syria, beginning in 2014, hundreds of incidents of chemical weapons use in that country against the Syrian population had been witnessed. Syria still had chemical weapons capabilities and never deserted its ambition to acquire further such capabilities. Syria's lack of cooperation with OPCW investigative teams, as well as its continued concealment and deception raised a real fear that there was a significant residual chemical array in Syria.\n\nMs. UDOM ( Ireland ), aligning with the European Union, condemned the Russian Federations engagement in dangerous disinformation campaigns concerning weapons of mass destruction, across multiple fora, against Ukraine, the United States and others. Such efforts risked undermining essential multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation instruments, upon which collective security depended. Ireland would continue to denounce those baseless claims. Her country fully supported the OPCW and rejected efforts to undermine its work or legitimacy. It looked forward to strengthening the Biological Weapons Convention at the upcoming ninth Review Conference. Developments since the last such conference particularly the COVID19 crisis illustrated that biological threats would not discriminate in an increasingly interconnected world. She added that export controls were central to countering the spread and use of weapons of mass destruction. She detailed Irelands support for certain export-control regimes, and stressed that they facilitated legitimate trade and supported international cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear, chemical and biological materials.\n\nNADER LOUAFI ( Angola ) said his country had signed and ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2015. Angola was committed to create legal mechanisms to achieve its objectives. Chemical weapons should be prohibited as they represented an obstacle to socioeconomic development in countries like his. In Angola, the national authority for arms control and disarmament and a civil commission had been created. Those bodies helped guide the relevant activities in his country, and, through its national strategy, prepared it to respond to chemical emergencies. As part of its implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, Angola had hosted training cycles for Portuguese-speaking Member States and participated in workshops, such as the basic course on responding to chemical emergencies in Rwanda, held in 2022. Interested in personnel training, it had decided to join other countries in contributing funds to finance a new centre for chemistry and technology, the \"Chem-Tech Centre\".\n\nNOHRA MARIA QUINTERO CORREA ( Colombia ) said disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destructions were part of Colombias foreign policy principles and constitutional mandate. She highlighted the need to investigate instances of weapons of mass destruction use and for perpetrators accountability. The OPCW was the competent forum for investigations. She supported the Chemical Weapon Conventions universalization and greater cooperation and technical assistance under its article 10. The Technical Secretariat with States Parties of Latin America and the Caribbean was aimed at capacity-building to ensure national and regional implementation.\n\nShe said the upcoming Biological Weapons Convention Review Conference was an opportunity to assess its implementation and compliance. Dual-use material was a source of concern, and she supported export and import control. States parties must bolster biological control mechanisms to avoid these materials slipping into the non-State actors hands. Moreover, terrorism financing should be investigated and sanctioned. She advocated for international cooperation in the field of biocontainment to bolster State capacity to prevent and respond to those types of threats. Moreover, the pandemics consequences on health, the economy, and society showed the need to promote solidarity, multilateral cooperation, and mutual confidence-building measures regarding the strictly peaceful use of those technologies. The legal instruments and established regimes on weapons of mass destruction must be safeguarded. Lastly, a gender perspective must be incorporated and the fundamental role of women in peacebuilding must be recognized, she said.\n\nKYAW MOE TUN ( Myanmar ), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), pointed out that the path to chemical and biological weapons was easier and cheaper than developing a nuclear bomb. The \"poor mans atomic bomb\" could be created using equipment and materials that had a host of civilian applications. Such weapons had become the best alternative to nuclear weapons for rogue States and non-State actors, and therefore, the international community must strengthen efforts to stop their proliferation. Condemning the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, he said that Myanmars military had reportedly engaged in a chemical programme that manufactured a sizeable amount of a Schedule I chemical. Information indicated that a facility under the militarys control near the town of Tongbo in the Bago region had produced sulphur mustard in the 1980s. The military had never been transparent regarding past chemical-weapons programmes and also had failed to be a good partner for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. He added a call to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention, as the lack of a verification system hindered its effectiveness and relevance.\n\nANATOLII ZLENKO ( Ukraine ) condemned in the strongest terms the repeated use of chemical weapons. Any possible use of weapons of mass destruction, including by terrorists, was a clear and ever-present danger to humankind. Ukraine, as a State with a nuclear-weapon past and a full-fledged State party to the NPT and Conventions on Chemical and Biological Weapons, adhered to Council resolution 1540 (2004). The Russian Federation was waging a full-scale war against Ukraine. The unprovoked and unjustified aggression was a serious challenge to the \"WMD regime\". The continuous shelling of Ukraines peaceful nuclear, chemical and other facilities by the Russian Federation forces threatened the integrity and physical protection of sensitive materials. That country had made many false allegations of chemical weapons use by Ukraine. None was true and no evidence was offered. The Russian Federation was failing to reach its goals on the battlefield and was becoming increasingly desperate. There was a real risk that Russian troops might use weapons of mass destruction as a last resort. He urged the international community to increase its pressure on that country to make it stop immediately its full-scale war of aggression and withdraw all its troops from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\n\nSEYED MAHDI SAJJADIEH ( Iran ) said recent developments had seriously damaged the Chemical Weapons Convention. A particular group of States parties had turned OPCW from a technical organization into a politicized and confrontational instrument to advance their narrow political goals. It was imperative that the United States, the sole possessor State of chemical weapons, take all necessary measures to expedite the completion of the destruction of its remaining stockpiles. In addition, the unilateral coercive measures imposed by the United States against Iran hampered access to necessary medicine and equipment for Iranian chemical weapons victims. The viability of the Chemical Weapons Convention, as well as OPCW, required enforcement of a consistent and apolitical approach. It was not acceptable to pressure Syria while it was implementing its obligations under the Convention and cooperating with OPCW, while also turning a blind eye to the clandestine Israeli chemical arsenal and its dangerous policies. Also, the unrestricted trading of chemicals by some States parties with a regime not party to the Convention challenged its universality, as well as the establishment in the Middle East of a zone free of mass destruction weapons.\n\nRight of Reply\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation , speaking in exercise of the right of reply, refused all attempts by the United States and its allies to cast doubts on the convincing materials his country had submitted at the Biological Weapons Convention States Parties Consultative Meeting. The Russian Federation had initiated the event because of well-founded questions regarding the honouring of the Conventions obligations by the United States and Ukraine. The fact that those discussions took place attested to the fact that the issues were topical. During the special military operation, the Russian Federation Ministry of Defence had submitted information regarding the United States and Ukraines non-compliance with their obligations. The Russian Federation had submitted the questions, but was not getting substantive answers. It had done everything in its power to ensure that the Consultative Meeting achieved the objectives and solved the issue.\n\nHe wanted Kyiv and Washington, D.C., to fix their state of affairs. As no consensus had been reached at the meeting, there remained outstanding issues that needed to be resolved, without which, the Biological Weapons Convention might be undermined. At the meeting, the United States and Ukraine made themselves the victims of unfounded attacks and tried to change the subject to ensure the event failed. They did not achieve their goal. With their destructive behaviour, they tried to conceal the Pentagons military activities outside its territory, right next to the Russian Federation. They said it was peaceful and had nothing to do with weapons, but that was just another attempt to distort fact and distract the international community from its own activities at odds with the Convention.\n\nTo resolve the issue required discussion at the ninth Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention, he said. The international community should not restrict itself to exchanging opinions, but should use all tools available, including article 6, to investigate the breaches of the Convention by the United States and Ukraine. There was an acute need to strengthen the Convention and set up a legally binding protocol. Since 2001, the United States had blocked that as it did not want its activities to become common knowledge. The Russian Federation had repeatedly asked for the inclusion of information about military activities beyond State borders and the placement of those activities under strict international control.\n\nThe representative of the United States , also speaking in exercise of the right of reply, said that, yesterday, the United States full transparent participation in the article 5 consultations had been discussed. The United States would continue to assist partners to strengthen global health security and assess the impact of infectious diseases on health. International cooperation and assistance, such as that provided to dozens of partners, played a critical role in capacity-building. Those partnerships were exclusively devoted to peaceful purposes and had nothing to do with weapons, only to protect the health of human and animals and biological security. Those efforts should be reinforced, not undermined. The unfounded accusations by the Russian Federation and China were not only an attack on the United States, but also on the partner countries and were unacceptable and reprehensible.\n\nIn addition, several delegations had raised questions regarding United States efforts in destroying its chemical weapon stockpiles. Her country had completed the destruction of 98 per cent of its declared stockpiles and remained on track to meet its 30 September 2023 deadline. The United States had shown extraordinary transparency and continued to accelerate towards its planned completion date. It had allowed OPCW continued presence to ensure verified destruction, even during the pandemic. She was committed to eliminating all chemical weapons stockpiles around the world and her country had provided aid in that regard. For example, it had given $3 billion to the Russian Federation to eliminate its declared stockpile.\n\nThe representative of Syria rejected allegations levelled against his country by others regarding the deployment of chemical weapons and a lack of cooperation with OPCW as fabricated and groundless. He pointed to the politicization of OPCWs work and its usurpation for political purposes. Syria rejected the use of chemical weapons in all circumstances, but the OPCW Investigation and Identification Team and its activities were an attempt to attack Syria. Several Western Governments had neglected Damascus cooperation with OPCW, but his country was committed to the destruction of all chemical weapons. It was unfortunate, however, that OPCW was being exploited to pursue the agendas of certain Western countries and that it had strayed from its established decisionmaking practices. Syria had provided detailed information in relevant fora, and it was \"unacceptable\" that doubt was being cast on the declaration it submitted to OPCW. It wis also strange that Western countries were accusing Damascus of using chemical weapons while they ignored well-documented attacks by terrorist groups.\n\nTo the representative of Israel, he said it was \"laughable that Israel is the one lecturing us about upholding international commitments\", as that State had an enormous arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, which had not been placed under international oversight. It also continuously attacked Syrian territory in violation of international law.\n\nThe representative of Ukraine said that the Russian Federation continued to disseminate fake narratives concerning the alleged development of a biological-weapons programme in Ukraine. The so-called evidence presented by the Russian Federation was concocted during its unjustified, unprovoked, full-scale war of aggression against Ukraine, a component of which was a powerful disinformation campaign. The origin of such evidence was also doubtful, as the Russian Federation was known for deceit, sabotage and cover-ups. He underscored that Ukraine had \"never, ever\" developed, produced or stored any chemical or biological weapon. It never had that intention, did not now and would not in the future, nor did it have the infrastructure to do so as it did not have biological labs capable of such research. Its national labs were devoted to public health, and its cooperation with the United States and other partners was entirely peaceful, aimed at preventing and counteracting outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation said he wished to respond to the groundless and provocative information by the United States and Ukraine regarding the well-founded rationale and evidence provided by the Russian Federation concerning articles I and IV of the Biological Weapons Convention. All the lies and misinformation were very easy to say, and propagandists loved to divert the attention of the international community from real threats in the biological sphere. The Russian Federation had gathered information regarding military biological activities in Ukraine. The aforementioned delegations had not taken a constructive approach to resolving the situation, he said, and had shown no interest in submitting well-argued, detailed answers to the questions put to them.\n\nConventional Weapons\n\nSOVANN KE ( Cambodia ), speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and associating with the Non-Aligned Movement, said that, owing to the current situation of conflict and political tensions, ASEAN was concerned about the illicit proliferation of conventional weapons throughout the world, which contributed to more violence and instability, prolonged poverty, and undermined human well-being. Those weapons not only effected local people, but also local governments and surrounding regions. Their effective regulation and control were needed, for which States bore the primary responsibility. At the same time, ASEAN acknowledged States sovereign rights to manage their conventional inventory for self-defence and national security.\n\nInternational action was a key step towards disarmament, he said, pointing to the Arms Trade Treaty and the Mine Ban Convention. He welcomed the outcome of the eighth Biennial Meeting, which would enhance global efforts to regulate the flow of small arms and light weapons, and combat their illicit trade. ASEAN had several regional mechanisms that focused on transnational crime and forensic science to combat smuggling and related transnational crimes in the region, as well as mutual legal assistance. In addition, he pointed to the threat posed by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs), particularly by non-State actors. He commended the role of the ASEAN Regional Mine Action Center (ARMAC) in addressing the issue of explosive remnants of war (ERW) and raising awareness. It was imperative that de-mining take a holistic approach with a focus on victim support and community development, and he called for financial, technical, and humanitarian aid for victims reintegration.\n\nEDUARDO ALCIBIADES SNCHEZ KIESSLICH ( Mexico ) said that challenges relating to small arms and light weapons required the United Nations attention in light of the destabilizing effects of the weapons trade. He was concerned over the increasing use of such weapons, which were responsible for almost half the violent deaths around the world. Those weapons were also connected to spirals of violence linked to transnational organized crime and terrorism. The illicit small arms and light weapons trade did not have an effective control mechanism, and the illegal trade across borders required shared action by all countries. The effective control of conventional weapons, particularly small arms and light weapons, was both a humanitarian imperative and necessary for sustainable development. To that end, Mexico would continue to promote mechanisms for information-sharing within and between nations. He also called for the creation of an international instrument to protect civilians and infrastructure from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, and he expressed concern over the development of autonomous weapons.\n\nMs. KAMINSKI ( Canada ) said history showed that policy and programming efforts addressing both the drivers and consequences of armed conflict should be gender-responsive in order to achieve robust and lasting outcomes. This year marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing of the Mine Ban Convention, which was the culmination of the Ottawa process and years of civil society engagement. Canada remained firmly committed to advancing the Conventions goals and objectives towards a world free of anti-personnel mines. It considered mine action to be essential to the achievement of sustainable development, as it supported peace and stabilization efforts and helped ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance. Significant legacy contamination remained and new contamination continued. Under international humanitarian law, weapon systems that were inherently indiscriminate or caused superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering should be restricted or prohibited. Those weapons systems had serious, multifaceted and long-lasting impacts on civilians and their communities.\n\nOSAMA MAHMOUD ABDEL KHALEK MAHMOUD ( Egypt ), associating with the Arab Group, Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group, voiced his commitment to multilateral efforts to tackle the illicit small arms and light weapons trade. Those efforts, however, should not negatively affect States right to legitimate defence. The Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons was an essential multilateral instrument, and he looked forward to elaborating issues related to the diversion of those weapons to unauthorized recipients. The Middle East and Africa faced serious risks, owing to increasing flows of small arms and light weapons to terrorists and illegal armed groups. Some States resorted to arming terrorists as a foreignpolicy tool, in clear violation of the Charter. That phenomenon required immediate attention. He reiterated the Arms Trade Treatys shortcomings, which made it possible to abuse it by monopolizing the legitimate conventional weapons trade in a politicized manner, while ignoring prevention of the illegal supply to unauthorized recipients. Egypt had suffered severely, as 20 per cent of the worlds landmines were placed on its soil during the Second World War, and he underlined the continued need for international cooperation.\n\nMs. HAKAOJA ( Finland ), aligning with the European Union, said that recent events had highlighted the importance of protecting the rules-based international system, as that directly impacted the international communitys ability to advance disarmament and non-proliferation. Disarmament and arms-control instruments must be effectively implemented, and as they were jointly created, must be jointly upheld. She underlined the need to promote national implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty and to fulfil its reporting obligations. She encouraged all States yet to do so to join that instrument. She spotlighted the need for continued international assistance to help countries develop their capacities and fulfil their commitments in that area, noting that Finland was a regular contributor to the United Nations Trust Facility Supporting Cooperation on Arms Regulation and the Saving Lives Entity. Finland also supported humanitarian mine action, providing funding for projects in Ukraine, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Somalia. She stressed the need to establish a normative and operational framework for the use of lethal autonomous weapons systems.\n\nMr. RYDNING (Norway) stated that, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 2021 broke yet another record for global military spending. Conventional arms and equipment consistently drew the most resources and remained the major cause of casualties and disruption in armed conflict, exacting the heaviest toll on civilians. He was convinced that improved security and protection for all could be achieved at significantly lower levels of armaments. Arms control, non-proliferation, disarmament, and transparency in armaments had a direct positive bearing on international peace and security. Conventional weapons had serious humanitarian impacts and exacerbated conflict and crime worldwide. Civilians accounted for almost 90 per cent of recorded casualties when explosive weapons were used in populated areas. The Russian Federation's brutal attacks on civilians in Ukraine was a stark reminder of that. With the promise of speed, efficiency, and accuracy exceeding human abilities, autonomous functionality was making its way into modern life, including weapons. Autonomy had significant potential, but it also raised serious legal, ethical, and military concerns, challenging conceptions of control and responsibility. Autonomous weapon systems needed human oversight.",

DW has the latest.\n\nThe head of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson in southern Ukraine says pro-Kremlin administrative officials are transporting people away from the regional capital to the left bank of the Dnipro River ahead of an expected offensive by Ukrainian forces.\n\n\"The entire administration is already moving today,\" Moscow-installed regional head Vladimir Saldo, said on Russian state television.\n\nKherson is one of four partially-occupied Ukrainian regions that Russia \"annexed\" following referendums widely judged as illegal.\n\nSaldo said some 40% of civilians would moved from potential conflict zones as a \"precaution.\"\n\nHowever, he said Moscow's forces would keep fighting.\n\n\"No one is going to hand over Kherson. But it is not ideal for residents to be in the city where hostilities will take place,\" Saldo said.\n\n\"We're expecting attacks. The Ukrainians are not hiding this. We have enough strength and capability to repel these attacks,\" he warned. \"The city will be completely held, but we need to keep civilians safe.\"\n\nSaldo earlier announced the civilians would be transported from four communities near the Dnipro River, citing the risk that Ukrainian shelling could damage a nearby dam.\n\nSome 50,000 to 60,000 people are to be relocated from the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, according to the Russian state-run news agency TASS.\n\nDW correspondent Mathias Blinger said there was a fear in Ukraine that people would be evacuated against their will.\n\n\"The fear here in Ukraine is of course that these may be forced evacuations deportations of people into Russia as we have seen in other parts of the occupied territories; that the Russians would forcibly drive people out of there and relocate them to Russia in order to maybe assimilate them later into Russian society. That would be a war crime.\"\n\nAround 5 million people have left for Russia from the four regions Moscow annexed in violation of international law, Nikolai Patrushev secretary of Russia's National Security Council claimed.\n\nIn a separate statement, Russia's Defense Ministry asserted that 4.6 million Ukrainians have arrived in the country since the start of the war.\n\nOccupied Kherson relocates residents To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHere are the other main headlines from the war in Ukraine on October 19.\n\nPutin bringing the war home to ordinary Russians, investigative journalist tells DW\n\nInvestigative journalist and writer Catherine Belton, who works for The Washington Post and is the author of the 2020 book Putin's People, told DW that Putin was becoming increasingly vulnerable in Russia due to the Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nShe explained her concern that the forced removal of citizens in Kherson could be used for a \"misinformation campaign.\" However, if Ukraine successfully took control of Kherson, this would signify a big loss for Putin. Asked about Putin's strategic options, the journalist highlighted that the Russian president had \"been backed into forcing the mobilization of his own people.\"\n\n\"He'd always promised that he was never going to have to do that. It's a deeply unpopular step, which really undermines the foundations of his own presidency. His legitimacy as president is based on his popularity,\" she continued.\n\nBut not only Putin's strategy options were becoming slimmer, his popularity among Russians at home was decreasing, too, Belton claimed: \"There was a recent opinion poll by the Kremlin linked Public Opinion Foundation, which found that 70% of Russians are now very, very anxious about what's going on. He's really bringing the situation home to ordinary Russians. So I think his position is much more precarious than it's ever been in his entire presidency.\"\n\nBelton went on to say that his standing within the elites had been affected. \"We're seeing divisions emerge within the elite around him.\"\n\n\"They're seeing Putin lose territory. And that's not just a loss to his popularity. It's kind of a loss to his standing within the elite. And suddenly he is becoming fair game,\" she added.\n\nBelton: Putin's position 'precarious' To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nUkraine to impose nationwide electricity restrictions\n\nAuthorities in Ukraine will impose restrictions on the use of electricity starting on Thursday, as continued Russian strikes over the past several days have crippled energy infrastructure.\n\nLarge parts of Ukraine have been hit with electricity and water outages.\n\n\"Today the enemy again destroyed energy generating facilities...it is necessary to minimize the use of electricity,\" said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president's office.\n\n\"Everyone should be ready, first, to save electricity, and second, rolling power blackouts are also possible if strikes continue,\" Tymoshenko said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that 30% of Ukraine's power stations have been destroyed.\n\nMissile strike hits major power plant in western Ukraine\n\nA thermal power station in the city of Burshtyn in western Ukraine was hit in a Russian attack on Wednesday, according to the Ivano-Frankivsk region governor Svitlana Onyshchuk.\n\nShe said no one was hurt in the strike that caused a fire at the plant but gave no further details of the damage.\n\nWednesday's salvo hit the Burshtyn plant that supplies electricity to three western regions and 5 million consumers.\n\nThe aftermath of a Russian strike on a power station in Kharkiv Image: Kostiantyn Liberov/AP/picture alliance\n\nIAEA's Grossi tells DW risk of accident is 'quite high' at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi told DW in an interview that the situation around the plant was \"really dangerous,\" and \"precarious.\"\n\nHis team has been working for weeks to establish a protection zone in the area, he said, but has not been successful yet.\n\nGrossi said that they were still negotiating the zone, but that \"both sides have agreed to work with me, so I hope we will be able to make progress pretty soon.\"\n\nHe said that a comparison with Chernobyl was not appropriate, because the technology was very different and because \" it's a much bigger plant\" with constant risks to its power supply.\n\nAsked whether Putin may use nuclear weapons amid a series of military setbacks, Grossi replied: \"I don't have any indication that would be the case.\"\n\nIAEA chief renews call for Zaporizhzhia safe zone To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nPutin declares martial law in occupied regions\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has introduced martial law in the occupied regions of Ukraine that Moscow claims to have annexed.\n\nThe Kremlin published a decree saying martial law would be introduced from early Thursday in the Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\n\"I signed a decree to introduce martial law in these four subjects of the Russian Federation,\" Putin said in a televised National Security Council meeting.\n\nPutin didn't initially spell out the measures that would be taken under martial law in the regions.\n\nIsrael offers Ukraine help with air-attack alerts but not weapons\n\nIsrael has offered to help Ukrainians develop air attack alerts for civilians, but was adamant it would stop short of sending weapons or its vaunted Iron Dome missile defense system to Kyiv.\n\n\"Maybe we can support them with an early warning systems that will allow them to alert the right population in a more accurate manner, which will then allow them to have some kind of long perspective emergency routine,\" Defense Minister Benny Gantz said.\n\nAfter a barrage of strikes on Ukrainian cities this week the country's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he would ask Israel for immediate air defense supplies.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also in the past hit out at Israel for not providing Kyiv with weapon systems.\n\nThough it has condemned the Russian invasion, Israel said it wanted to continue cooperation with Moscow over war-ravaged neighbor Syria.\n\n\"The policy towards Ukraine will not change. We will continue to support it and stand by the West.

Kotrikadze now works from abroad.\n\nShe was asked about how Putin declaring martial law in Ukraine affects the Russian public's perception of the war.\n\n\"This is something that brings us very close to the moment when the president of the Russian Federation and his employees, including their representatives of the Russian government, would be forced to name this situation a war. Because, so far, they were insisting on the so-called \"special military operation,\" not acknowledging and not telling Russians that this is actually a war going on not only in Ukraine but also on the parts of Russian Federation.\"\n\nKotrikadze said areas of Russia in the Belgorod region on the Ukrainian border are at risk of shelling.\n\nShe added \"people are scared to death in Russia\" after the so-called partial mobilization and after decreeing martial law in Ukraine.\n\nThe war is \"getting closer and closer to Russians,\" she said.\n\n\"People now are acknowledging they are understanding that this war is coming to their homes,\" she said.\n\nKotrikadze added Putin has a tough choice to make on how to continue with \"his mobilization, this martial law, all the problems that Russian regions, Russian regions are going through right now.\"\n\nUkraine war is having an impact 'closer to home' To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nPeople of Ukraine win EU rights award\n\nEuropean lawmakers have awarded the Sakharov Prize For Freedom of Thought to the Ukrainian people.\n\n\"This award is for those Ukrainians fighting on the ground, for those who have been forced to flee, for those who have lost relatives and friends, for all those who stand up and fight for who and what they believe in,\" said European Parliament president Roberta Metsola.\n\nThe award comes with prize money of 50,000 ($49,100), which the EU said would be distributed to representatives of Ukrainian civil society.\n\nGerman President postpones Ukraine trip\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has called off a planned visit to Kyiv for security reasons, according to his office. Steinmeier was due to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.\n\nHis office said security authorities in Germany and the Foreign Ministry had advised Steinmeier not to go. However, the visit is expected to be rescheduled soon.\n\nE U draws up sanctions on Iran over Russia drones\n\nEuropean Union member state governments have provisionally agreed sanctions against eight people and entities over the use of Iranian-made unmanned aircraft in Russian strikes on Ukraine, according to diplomatic sources.\n\nSanctions experts from the 27 EU members agreed to the list in a meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\"Now that we have gathered our own sufficient evidence work is ongoing in the [European] Council in view of a clear, swift and firm EU response,\" said Nabila Massrali, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.\n\nOne diplomat said the list would likely be completed in time for a meeting of European leaders, to start late on Thursday.\n\nUkraine urged sanctions against Iran on Monday, haiving accused Tehran for weeks of supplying Russia with Shahed-136 drones.\n\nEU chief says infrastructure strikes are 'war crimes'\n\nThe head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has called Russian strikes targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine \"war crimes.\"\n\nVon der Leyen told members of the European Parliament the attacks had the clear aim of depriving people of electricity and water in the winter months.\n\n\"Yesterday we saw again Russia's targeted attacks against civilian infrastructure, and this is marking a new chapter in an already very cruel war,\" von der Leyen told members of the parliament in Strasbourg.\n\nThe president of the European Commission also reiterated the European Union's support for Ukraine \"for as long as it takes.\"\n\nRussia on Monday launched dozens of unmanned aerial vehicles on Ukraine that hit infrastructure, killing five people in the capital Kyiv.\n\nUkraine says the kamikaze drones are Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack craft that cruise towards their target before dropping at velocity and detonating on impact. Missiles have also been used to damage Ukraine's critical infrastructure in the past nine days.\n\nMoscow has focused particularly on attacking Ukraine's infrastructure grid, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying some 30% of the country's power plants have been destroyed.\n\nDrones show Moscow is 'militarily bankrupt'\n\nRussia's dependence on Iranian-made drones to attack Ukrainian targets exposes Moscow as \"bankrupt\" both politically and militarily, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday.\n\nUsing Iranian weaponry amounted to an acknowledgment of failure by the Kremlin, he added.\n\n\"For decades, they spent billions of dollars on their own military-industrial complex. And in the end, they bowed down to Tehran in order to secure quite simple drones and missiles,\" Zelenskyy said in a nightly video address.\n\nUkraine says Russia's latest attacks on infrastructure have relied on the Iranian-made drones. Iran denies supplying unmanned aerial vehicles to Russia.\n\nIn his address, Zelenskyy also thanked everyone who helps Ukraine with anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. According to the president, the German \"IRIS-T\" has shown itself as \"a really effective system.\"\n\n\"We are working with partners to provide even more protection to the Ukrainian sky,\" Zelenskyy added.\n\nRussian commander admits situation for his troops is 'tense'\n\nThe new Russian military commander for Ukraine operations said that Russia's army is preparing to evacuate civilians from the Kherson region.\n\n\"The Russian army will above all ensure the safe evacuation of the population\" of Kherson, General Sergey Surovikin told Russian state television,\n\nSurovikin, who has been in the job for the past 10 days, added the combat situation there was \"very tense.\"\n\n\"The enemy is not abandoning its attempts to attack Russian troop positions,\" he added, in a rare admission of the pressures being felt by his forces.\n\nGermany sends further military support to Ukraine\n\nThe government revealed on Tuesday that it had supplied Ukraine with five more armored recovery vehicles. That doubles the total amount sent by Germany.\n\nBerlin also delivered seven bridge systems to enable the crossing of rivers.\n\nAs well as more ammunition, Germany has also sent winter clothing, power generators and first aid kits.\n\nUS and allies to raise Iranian drone transfers to Russia at UN\n\nThe United States, Britain and France plan to raise alleged Iranian arms transfers to Russia at a closed-door UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday, diplomats said, after Ukraine said Russia's having obtained drones violated a Council resolution.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the diplomats said the three - which also believe such transfers violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231 - told their Council counterparts they would ask a UN official to brief members on the issue.\n\nRussia launched dozens of \"kamikaze\" drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on Ukraine on Monday, hitting energy infrastructure and killing five people in the capital Kyiv. Ukraine says they are Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack drones.\n\nMore from DW's coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nSuicide drones are said to have been used to attack the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Tehran has denied supplying Moscow with the equipment. What do we know about drone imports?\n\nAfter the rockets comes the propaganda pro-Russian voices have claimed that wounded people in Kyiv were just actors staging their suffering.

Kadyrov claims that his forces killed some 70 Ukrainians in a revenge attack, but this could not be verified.\n\nUS accuses Russia of wasting UN Security Council's time\n\nWashington has responded to claims of US \"military biological programs\" in Ukraine made by Moscow as a waste of the UN Security Council's time.\n\nThe US and Ukraine have rejected previous similar claims made by Russian authorities, but a new attempt from the Kremlin to call for a formal inquiry from the Security Council has been branded as the spreading of conspiracy theories.\n\n\"How much more of this nonsense do we have to endure?\" Britain's UN Ambassador Barbara Woodward asked the council.\n\nHer US counterpart Linda Thomas-Greenfield described the claims as \"pure fabrications brought forth without a shred of evidence.\"\n\nUS planning another $275 million military assistance package\n\nThe White House is expected to announce a new round of military assistance to Ukraine Reuters reported on Thursday.\n\nThe package is likely to include ammunition and further High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMAR) launchers that have played a key role in Ukraine's counter-offensive.\n\nThe US has already spent over $17 billion to assist Ukraine hold off Russia's invasion.\n\nPutin says West uses sanctions to hold back rivals\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, speaking to the Valdai Discussion Club, accused Western nations of using economic sanctions and \"color revolutions\" against rivals and said they could not compete fairly with the rising economic and political might of Asia.\n\nPutin said Western countries had \"thrown aside the rules\" of international affairs in order to maintain their domination and hold down what they saw as \"second-class civilizations.\"\n\nAccording to Putin, the West was playing a \"dangerous, bloody and dirty\" game over Ukraine, which Russian forces invaded in February. Putin said he believes the United States and its allies would ultimately have to talk to Russia to end the war Moscow started.\n\nPutin also ruled out the option of using nuclear weapons in Ukraine and reiterated his unproven allegations that Ukraine intends to use a \"dirty bomb.\"\n\nPutin lashes out at West in public discussion To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHe claimed the decade ahead is the most \"dangerous\" since the end of the Second World War.\n\nHe accused the US of squandering its diplomatic relations with China after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. He also said Washington had botched its attempt at a nuclear deal with North Korea by introducing sanctions against Pyongyang.\n\nThe White House said Putin's speech \"wasn't that new\" and did not indicate a change in Russia's war strategy.\n\nIMF chief says EU and US Ukraine aid pledges 'sufficient' for 2023\n\nIMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said financial pledges for Ukraine by the United States and Europe should be sufficient to get Kyiv through 2023, assuming the war does not intensify.\n\n\"Yes, we would go to 2023 with sufficient financial support for Ukraine,\" Georgieva said on the sidelines of a conference organized by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.\n\n\"When we look into next year, the numbers are significant, but they are not out of context of what has been done up to now,\" she added, underlining that the outlook was highly uncertain.\n\nEarlier in October, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the country's partners to help cover Kyiv's budgetary deficit of $38 billion in 2023.\n\nRussia warns of revenge if EU confiscates state assets\n\nRussia will retaliate if its state and citizens' assets are confiscated by the European Union, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.\n\nAsked about comments reportedly made by European leaders suggesting Russian assets in the EU could be confiscated, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said this would be \"stealing\".\n\n\"The EU judiciary refuses to protect Russians' property,\" she said.\n\nKyiv region has 30% energy capacity deficit after strikes\n\nThe Kyiv region, including the capital city itself, faces a 30% deficit in its capacity to generate the power it needs following Russian strikes overnight targeting energy infrastructure, the regional governor said.\n\n\"Last night the enemy damaged the facilities of the energy infrastructure of our region. A number of critical facilities have been disabled,\" Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nSeparately, the Kyiv region's military administration said the region must \"prepare for emergency power outages for an indefinite period\" because of the Russian strikes.\n\nGermany believes explosions affected both Nord Stream 2 pipes\n\nThe German government thinks it is unlikely that one of the two pipes of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea is still completely intact following explosions in September.\n\n\"It's very likely that the act of sabotage with strong explosions had a negative impact on both pipeline routes and that the basic technical accessibility is therefore no longer guaranteed,\" the government said.\n\nUnexplained blasts in late September caused four gas leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea - two in Swedish waters and two in Danish waters. Many analysts have argued that the blast was intentional and some have said it could have been a Russian act, which Moscow denies.\n\nEU leaders say Nord Stream leaks 'sabotage' To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSwitzerland to examine German request to re-export weapons to Ukraine\n\nGermany has made another request to neutral Switzerland to allow it to re-export Swiss-made ammunition to Ukraine to be used in its war against Russia, after being rebuffed earlier this year. Germany has supplied 30 Gepard tanks to Ukraine and some 60,000 rounds of ammunition.\n\nA spokesman for the Swiss economic affairs department said a letter on the topic had been received from the German Ministry of Defence, adding that Economic Affairs Minister Guy Parmelin \"will respond to this letter in a timely manner\". The spokesman declined to comment if Ukraine had also made representations to the Swiss government.\n\nIn April Bern vetoed the re-export of Swiss-made ammunition used by Gepard anti-aircraft tanks. The 35mm shells were originally supplied by Swiss companies to the German army decades ago, but were blocked from re-export after the Swiss government said deliveries would breach Switzerland's neutrality law.\n\nEU proposals to cap Russian gas prices 'unthinkable'\n\nIgor Sechin, the head of Russia's largest oil producer Rosneft, said that proposals by the European Commission to introduce cap prices for Russian gas were \"unthinkable.\"\n\nSpeaking at an international forum in Baku, Sechin said that Western sanctions were destroying corporate law, while the refusal to buy Russian hydrocarbons is leading to an \"acute energy deficit,\" boosting global inflation.\n\nHe also said that Saudi Arabia's position on the global oil market was \"reasonable\" and based on an analysis of oil supply and demand.\n\nThe OPEC+ group of global leading oil producers, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia, agreed earlier this month to cut its combined output by 2 million barrels per day despite opposition from the United States, which wants lower fuel prices.\n\nCrimea power plant hit by drone attack, Ukraine power grid struck\n\nAuthorities in Moscow-annexed Crimea said Thursday that a thermal power plant on the peninsula was targeted by an overnight drone attack, but claimed it was not badly damaged.\n\n\"Today at night there was a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack on the Balaklava thermal power station,\" the Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhayev said on Telegram. \"The transformer is minimally damaged. There were no casualties,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, overnight damage to the power grid in central regions of Ukraine caused electricity to be cut off. Further supply restrictions are possible, grid operator Ukrenergo said.\n\n\"Equipment at the major network of the Ukrainian energy system in the central regions was damaged,\" it said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nRussia has stepped up its strikes on crucial Ukrainian infrastructure including the power grid in recent weeks, leaving millions without electricity or heating for lengthy periods of time as winter approaches.\n\nRussia involves regional officials in war effort UK defense ministry\n\nBy appointing Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin as regional coordinator in the war against Ukraine, the Kremlin wants to divert public criticism from the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, according to the latest UK defense intelligence update.\n\n\"This measure is likely to lead to a closer interlinking of regional governors into Russia's national security system,\" the update read.\n\nThe greater involvement of regional officials is likely at least partially designed to deflect public criticism away from the national leadership, UK Defense Ministry said.\n\nAustralia to train Ukrainian troops\n\nAustralia said it will deploy 70 soldiers to Britain to help train Ukrainian troops there and ship 30 more armored vehicles to bolster Kyiv's war against Russia's invasion.\n\n\"We expect this now to be a protracted conflict,\" Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles told ABC television. The latest package takes Australia's support for Ukraine to about A$655 million ($425 million; 422.5 million) since the Russian invasion in February.\n\n\"We're mindful that Ukraine needs to now be supported over the longer term if we're going to put Ukraine in a position where it can resolve this conflict on its own terms,\" he said.\n\nAustralia, one of the largest non-NATO contributors to the West's support for Ukraine, has been supplying aid and defense equipment and has banned exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to Russia. It has also placed sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals and entities.\n\nMore DW content on the war in Ukraine\n\nHundreds of Ukrainian cultural sites have been affected by the Russian invasion.

The Pentagon's readout of the call said Austin told Shoigu he \"rejected any pretext for Russian escalation.\"\n\nWithout providing evidence, Shoigu said Ukraine could escalate by using a \"dirty bomb\" - conventional explosives laced with radioactive material. Ukraine does not possess nuclear weapons, while Russia has said it could protect Russian territory with its nuclear arsenal.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba rejected the allegation, calling it \"absurd\" and \"dangerous\". He added: \"Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves.\"\n\nThe White House National Security Council also rejected Shoigu's claims. \"The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,\" a statement from the Council said.\n\nCHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION\n\nIn his nightly video message, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said only Russia was capable of using nuclear weapons in Europe, and Shoigu's \"telephone carousel\" made matters clear.\n\n\"Everyone understands full well,\" Zelenskiy said. \"They understand who is the source of all the dirty things imaginable in this war.\"\n\nA Russian missile strike on Sunday wiped out the top floor of an apartment block in Mykolaiv, sending shrapnel and debris across a plaza and into neighbouring buildings, smashing windows and cracking walls. Cars were crushed under rubble, Reuters witnessed. No fatalities were recorded.\n\n\"After the first blast, I tried to get out, but the door was stuck. After a minute or two, there was a second loud blast. Our door was blown into the corridor,\" said Oleksandr Mezinov, 50, who was woken from his bed by the blasts.\n\nUkraine shot down 14 Russian \"kamikaze\" drones over Mykolaiv overnight, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram. The drones are designed to explode on impact and have hammered Ukraine's energy infrastructure this month.\n\nUkraine says Russia has used Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack drones. Tehran denies supplying the drones to Moscow - an assertion Washington says is untrue.\n\nKim said Russia also attacked with S-300 missiles, one of which hit the five-storey apartment building.\n\n[1/23]A local man throws debris out of a broken window in a residential building heavily damaged by a Russian missile attack in Mykolaiv, Ukraine October 23, 2022. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nINTENSIFYING ATTACKS\n\nUkraine's advances in recent weeks around Kherson and in the country's northeast have been met with intensifying Russian missile and drone attacks on civilian infrastructure, which have destroyed about 40% of Ukraine's power system ahead of winter.\n\nRussian troops have withdrawn from parts of the front in recent weeks and occupation authorities are evacuating civilians deeper into Russian-held territory before an expected battle for Kherson, the regional capital on the west bank of the Dnipro river. Kherson is a gateway to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\n\"The situation today is difficult. It's vital to save your lives,\" Russian Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said in a video message. \"It won't be for long. You will definitely return,\" he added.\n\nRussia-installed authorities there reported a shortage of vessels to ferry people across the river at one point on Sunday, blaming a \"sharp increase in the number of people wishing to leave.\"\n\nAround 25,000 people have been evacuated since Tuesday, the Interfax news agency said.\n\nUkraine's military said it was making gains in the south, taking over at least two villages it said Russia had abandoned.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the accounts.\n\nWINTER MISERY LOOMS\n\nRussia and Ukraine have accused each other of planning to blow up the Nova Kakhovka dam, which holds roughly as much water as the Great Salt Lake in the U.S. state of Utah. Breaching it could flood a swathe of southern Ukraine, including Kherson.\n\nNeither side has produced evidence to back up their claims about the dam, which supplies water to Crimea and the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.\n\nZelenskiy said the Russian attacks on energy infrastructure had struck on a \"very wide\" scale.\n\nWith the war about to start its ninth month and winter approaching, the potential for freezing misery loomed.\n\nMore than a million people were without power, presidential adviser Kyrylo Tymoshenko said. A city official said strikes could leave Kyiv without power and heat for days or weeks.\n\nMoscow has acknowledged targeting energy infrastructure but denies targeting civilians in what it calls a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\n\nAdditional reporting by Jake Cordell and Valentyn Ogirenko in Mykolaiv; Writing by Frank Jack Daniel and Humeyra Pamuk; Editing by Edmund Blair and Daniel Wallis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The U.S. rejected the accusation, while the UN said it was \"not aware\" of any such program in Ukraine.\n\nAfter a closed-door UN Security Council meeting, Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said they were serious about the dirty bomb allegation.\n\n\"We would be happy to be mistaken, but we cannot simply ignore this,\" he said.\n\n\"These allegations are very serious and may lead to very, very unfortunate consequences,\" he said.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog, said it would carry out an \"independent verification\" in Ukraine this week, inspecting the locations that Moscow tied to its allegations.\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Grossi, who attended the Security Council meeting, said they would work \"to detect any diversion of nuclear material under safeguards, any undeclared production or processing of nuclear material at the two locations and assure that there are no undeclared nuclear material and activities.\"\n\nThe agency said it had inspected \"one of the two locations a month ago and no undeclared nuclear activities or materials were found there.\"\n\nNew worries on grain exports\n\nBoth Ukraine and the United States raised fresh concerns about the pace of grain exports from Ukraine, vital to the world but which Ukraine says are being held up by Russian ship inspections.\n\nOn Wednesday, after meeting with Guinea-Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo, who represented the Economic Community of West African States, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said there was a backup of 175 ships waiting to pick up and deliver grain.\n\nZelensky said the backup was a \"deterioration of access to food for millions of people\" in Africa, Asia and Europe.\n\nIn Ottawa on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia would face \"great anger\" if it backs out of the pact to permit Ukraine grain stocks to be delivered to global markets.\n\nThe 120-day pact expires on Nov. 19, and the backup of the ships and uncertainty over whether it will be renewed has already caused prices of some food products to rise.\n\n\"The idea that Russia would now say it doesn't want to continue it, it wants to turn it off, I think, will be met with great anger by countries around the world who are benefiting from Ukrainian grain,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"I think it's profoundly in everyone's interest to make sure that this grain can continue to move out of Ukraine and certainly, we will do everything we can to sustain the agreement,\" he said.",

(Alexei Babushkin/Sputnik/Kremlin)\n\nThe Russian exercise comes amid Moscow's warnings of a purported Ukrainian plot to detonate a radioactive device in a false flag attack to blame Russia, a claim strongly rejected by Ukraine and its allies.\n\nRussia has continued banging that drum this week, including comments from Shoigu and Putin and a message given behind closed doors to the United Nations Security Council.\n\nShoigu called his counterparts from India and China to convey Moscow's concern about the purported Ukrainian plan, following a series of calls earlier in the week with NATO defence ministers.\n\nPutin warns of 'so-called dirty bomb'\n\nPutin spoke of the alleged threat on Wednesday, telling a meeting of intelligence officials from the CIS group of ex-Soviet countries that the West was \"pumping\" Ukraine with heavy weapons, adding, \"There are also plans to use a so-called dirty bomb for provocations.\" It was the first time Putin himself made the dirty bomb allegation.\n\nA dirty bomb uses explosives to scatter radioactive waste in an effort to sow terror. Such weapons don't have the devastating destruction of a nuclear explosion but could expose broad areas to radioactive contamination that could last for years.\n\nWestern allies have dismissed as absurd the idea that Ukraine would contaminate its own land with toxic waste when Russia is on its back foot on the battlefield. Russia has provided no proof of the allegation.\n\nBritain's deputy UN ambassador, James Kariuki, called the allegations \"pure Russian misinformation of the kind we've seen many times before.\"\n\nWestern officials have expressed fear the warning looks designed to serve as the justification for some kind of Russian battlefield escalation at a time when Ukrainian forces are advancing inside Russian-occupied Kherson province.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday that the 30-nation military organization \"will not be intimidated or deterred from supporting Ukraine's right to self-defence for as long as it takes.\"\n\nWATCH | Ukraine denies Russia's 'dirty bomb' accusation: Ukraine denies Russias dirty bomb accusation Duration 2:07 Featured Video Ukraine is denying claims from Russia that it is about to launch a radioactive dirty bomb attack, a claim Western allies have also dismissed. United Nations inspectors will be heading to the country at Kyiv's request to debunk the accusation.\n\nSince Russian forces suffered major defeats in Ukraine in September, Putin has doubled down, calling up hundreds of thousands of reservists, announcing the annexation of occupied territory and engaging in threats.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden warned Moscow on Tuesday that any use of a nuclear weapons by Russia would be an \"incredibly serious mistake.\"\n\nSlovenia's government said Russia has been engaging in a disinformation campaign about the \"dirty bombs,\" using a 2010 photo from the European Union country's Agency for Radioactive Waste titled \"Ukraine's capacities to create the dirty bomb.\"\n\nPutin claims openness to negotiations\n\nThe photo shows bags containing smoke detectors bearing inscriptions in Slovenian reading \"radioaktivno,\" or radioactive. The Slovenian government says the detectors contain a radioactive source but isn't one of those listed below the photo in the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry release. Slovenia's government said on Twitter that its radioactive waste is stored safely and is not used for dirty bombs.\n\nWhile continuing to issue unsubstantiated claims, Putin is still sending signals that he's open to negotiations with Kyiv. The latest message came via Umaro Mokhtar Sissoco Embalo, President of Guinea-Bissau, who visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n\"I was in Russia with President Putin, who asked me to forward you what we spoke about, something he thinks would be very important. He wishes and thinks that a direct dialogue should happen between your two countries,\" the Guinea-Bissau leader said.\n\nA woman mourns at the grave of her only son, a military servicemen killed during a Russian bombing raid, at a cemetery in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, on Wednesday.

(Emilio Morenatti/The Associated Press)\n\nAt a news conference, Zelenskyy responded that a prerequisite for talks would be Russia's recognition of Ukraine's territory, borders and sovereignty.\n\nThe two sides have managed limited co-operation on certain issues, such as the exchange of prisoners of war and repatriation of remains.\n\nRussia hits more than 40 towns\n\nOn the ground, Ukrainian officials say Russia has targeted more than 40 towns around Ukraine over the past day, killing at least two more people and sustaining the terror that forces people into air raid shelters each night.\n\nThe General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said on Wednesday that Russian forces launched five rockets, 30 air strikes and more than 100 multiple-launch rocket system attacks on Ukrainian targets.\n\nA Ukrainian official reported Wednesday that a Russian strike hit a gas station in the city of Dnipro, killing two people, including a pregnant woman. The governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko, said four wounded people were hospitalized.\n\nMykolaiv, a southern port city near the war's front line, is among the places where residents have lined up to receive rations of bread and canned food as increases in food prices and losses of income add to the war-time burdens of low-income households in Ukraine.\n\nSeveral buildings and neighbourhoods were struck in Mykolaiv on Tuesday, though it was still unclear if there were any casualties, according to local authorities.\n\nMissiles continued early Wednesday morning.\n\n'It's terrifying'\n\nThe sole food distribution point in Mykolaiv allows each person to receive free bread once every three days. Many must walk long distances to collect the essential food items for their family.\n\n\"Bread and canned food is all I eat. It's almost winter already, and it's terrifying,\" Anna Bilousova, 70, said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin on Wednesday kept the door open for talks on a possible swap involving jailed U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner but reiterated that any such discussions must be kept strictly confidential.\n\nA Russian court on Tuesday rejected Griner's appeal against her nine-year prison sentence for drug possession. The eight-time all-star centre with the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medallist was convicted Aug. 4 after police said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport.",

Nicole Tung for The New York Times\n\nKYIV, Ukraine The civilian administration installed by President President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the strategically important southern port city of Kherson began to crumble on Monday, with proxy officials abandoning the government headquarters as Ukrainian forces continued to make progress advancing on the city.\n\nUkrainian officials, videos on social media and accounts from Ukrainian activists who have spoken to residents offered a glimpse of the chaotic situation on the ground in Kherson: Merchants are refusing to be paid in Russian currency, government offices have been emptied of essential equipment and civilians have been told by proxy officials loyal to the Kremlin to take \"documents, money, valuables and clothes\" and flee the city.\n\nAccounts from Ukrainian officials and activists suggested the occupation administration was in disarray and the humanitarian situation was growing dire.\n\nThe reports were difficult to verify independently because internet and other communication services in Kherson have been almost completely severed, in what Ukrainian activists said was a deliberate effort by Russian officials to thwart Kyivs military.\n\nBut even as the situation in Kherson appeared to be increasingly unstable, Ukrainian officials said Moscows troops were preparing to stay and fight for a city that Mr. Putin illegally claimed as Russian territory less than three weeks ago.\n\nThere was no evidence that Russian soldiers were preparing for a mass withdrawal, Gen. Kyrylo O. Budanov, the head of Ukraines military intelligence service, said in an interview published Monday by a Ukrainian news outlet, Ukrainska Pravda.\n\nHe added that the Kremlin proxy officials moves to evacuate civilians and pull their own workers out of the city could be an effort to ready Kherson for urban combat by Russian troops.\n\n\"They are not preparing to exit now,\" General Budanov said of Russian soldiers. \"They are preparing to defend.\"\n\nSerhii Khlan, the exiled deputy governor of the Kherson region, said Moscows forces and local proxies are engaged in \"intense pillaging,\" stealing \"everything with archaeological and historical significance.\" While his claims could not be independently verified, looting by Russian forces in other parts of the country has been widely documented.\n\nGeneral Budanov said the largest Russian bank operating in the city, Promsvyazbank, was withdrawing and clearing out the cash from its vaults. He also claimed that occupation officials were emptying hospitals of patients as part \"a crazy information campaign\" designed to show audiences in Russia that Moscow cares about civilians.\n\n\"In other words, they are creating the illusion that everything has gone,\" he said. \"At the same time, on the contrary, they are bringing in new military units there and preparing the streets of the city for defense.\"\n\nLocated on the west bank of the Dnipro River, Kherson is the gateway to both Russian-held Crimea in the south and Ukraines Black Sea ports to the west, including Odesa. Its loss would be a severe military and symbolic blow for Mr. Putin, who has rejected requests from his commanders on the ground that they be allowed to retreat from the city.\n\nWhile the billboards declaring \"Kherson is forever with Russia\" are still standing, local leaders loyal to the Kremlin said this weekend that \"all departments and ministries of civil administration\" must be moved across the Dnipro River to territory seen as safer from advancing Ukrainian forces. Occupation officials also said they would relocate as many as 60,000 civilians.\n\nMoscow claims that as many as 20,000 people have fled, but Ukrainian officials put the figure at closer to 1,000 and say that most are pro-Kremlin collaborators.\n\nImage People who fled their homes in southern Ukraine were staying at a center for displaced people in Zaporizhzia on Sunday. Credit... Ivor Prickett for The New York Times\n\nKyiv has imposed a blackout on detailed information about its southern offensive, aiming to maintain an element of surprise as its forces fight to reclaim towns and villages around Kherson, which Russia seized in the first weeks of the war and is the only provincial capital in Ukraine to fall since Moscows invasion. The Ukrainian militarys southern command said on Monday that since it launched its counteroffensive at the end of August, its forces have retaken 90 towns and villages where more than 12,000 people were still living.\n\nRussias hold on Kherson appears increasingly precarious. Last week, the top Russian commander in Ukraine, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, said the situation in Kherson was \"already difficult\" and that he was \"not ruling out difficult decisions,\" although he did not elaborate.",

Western countries have widely rejected those allegations as false, and Ukraine has warned that Moscow itself could be preparing such an attack.\n\nRegardless, Russia is standing by its claims.\n\nRead more here:\n\nWill Belarus join the war?\n\nGetty Images\n\nRussia and Belarus held joint military drills near the Ukrainian border in February - just days before Russia's full-scale invasion\n\nThere are fears that Belarus and Russia could be planning a joint incursion across Ukraine's northern border, after the Kremlin sent thousands of troops to Belarus.\n\nIt has prompted a blunt warning from Ukraine -\"If the Belarusian army supports Russian aggression, we will respond with our entire arsenal of weapons.\"\n\nBelarus shares a border with both Russia and Ukraine, and its authoritarian government, headed by Alexander Lukashenko, is fiercely loyal to the Kremlin.\n\nBelarus is already heavily involved in the war, and is also very dependent on Russia, so if Moscow pressures Minsk to step-up its support - there is not much wiggle room.\n\nMercedes pulls out of Russia\n\nGetty Images\n\nEight months into the war huge companies continue to leave Russia - Mercedes-Benz is the latest.\n\nThe German-based luxury vehicle company stopped manufacturing in and exporting to Russia in early March.\n\nBut now it says it will withdraw completely from the Russian market and sell shares in its subsidiaries to a local investor.\n\nFord confirmed on Wednesday that it had finalised a deal to leave Russia too.\n\nRow erupts over superyacht\n\nGetty Images\n\nMeanwhile all the way over in South Africa, a row has erupted over a Russian oligarch's superyacht, which has left Hong Kong and is heading to Cape Town.\n\nSouth Africa's government insists it will allow The Nord to dock - but Cape Town's mayor says it should be turned away.\n\nThe Nord belongs to Alexei Mordashov, an ally of Vladimir Putin who has been sanctioned by the EU and US.\n\nMayor Geordin Hill-Lewis says he has a \"moral duty\" to oppose Russia's \"unjust war\" and has vowed to block the yacht.\n\nBut a spokesman for President Cyril Ramaphosa said: \"South Africa has no legal obligation to abide by sanctions imposed by the US and EU.\"\n\nEven if the mayor gets his way - it is not clear how Cape Town officials plan to stop the enormous vessel from docking when it arrives.",

Countries that buy crude oil and those that produce it exchange DOLLAR in a system called the petrodollar system.\n\nAs the USA shifted from being a net importer to a net exporter of energy in 2020 and was the largest global producer in 2021. A rise in Oil prices helps the US earn more revenue and thus makes the US dollar stronger.\n\nIndias Oil Import/Consumption:\n\nIndia is the worlds third-largest oil consumer at around 5 million barrels a day (almost 86% of its need is imported), behind the US and China. The Middle East accounts for 60% of all oil bought by India while Latin America and Africa are the other big supplier blocks.\n\nImplications of High oil prices for India:\n\nIncreases the import bill:\n\nCrude has a share of 30-33 per cent in total imports and any hike in prices increases the import bill, thus negatively affecting Indias Current Account Deficit and increasing Indias fuel subsidies . A current account deficit indicates that a country is importing more than it is exporting\n\nand any hike in prices increases the import bill, thus negatively affecting and .\n\nInflation:\n\nAny increase in Crude Oil prices directly increases Inflation (unless subsidised by the government).\n\nInflation in imports:\n\nWith a weaker Indian currency, all imported items will be more expensive in rupees, forcing the RBI to take further action. However, RBIs measure will lead to a decrease in Indias forex reserves.\n\nIndustries:\n\nUser industries of oil like chemicals, plastics and fertilisers will face a problem again. Higher input costs will put pressure on profit margins and any pass-through will be inflationary.\n\n5. States and centres tax revenue:\n\nThe state governments will be better off as their VAT collections would increase automatically with an increase in Oil prices. However, the Centre may not gain as the excise duty is a fixed rate e.g. Rs. 3.4 Per litre.\n\nBond yields:\n\nBond yields move up every time oil prices rise while stock markets turn volatile normally in the downward direction. As a consequence, economic uncertainty will intensify once again . The yield of a bond is the interest rate investors earn when they buy the bond.\n\n.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe problem with rising oil prices and a declining rupee is that these are external to the system over which there is little control. The RBIs intervention and protection of currency have their limitations. These travails have to be responded to as they cannot be controlled.\n\nTherefore, India needs to reduce its dependence on imported oil (e.g. use of renewables, use of bio-fuels) and also increase its export capacity to reduce any impact on its currency. Further India should go for increased use of the Indian Rupee for International trade.\n\nWhat Is the Balance of Trade (BOT)? Balance of trade (BOT) is the difference between the value of a countrys exports and the value of a countrys imports for a given period. Balance of trade is the largest component of a countrys balance of payments (BOP). Balance of Payments (BOP): The balance of payments (BOP), is a statement of all transactions made between entities in one country and the rest of the world over a defined period, such as a quarter or a year.\n\nInsta Links:\n\nPrelims link:\n\nWhat is a Current Account Deficit (CAD)? Balance of Payments Balance of trade About Petrodollar System\n\nMains Link:\n\nQ. Policymakers have little control over the dollar and crude oil. It is impossible to take a call on how these prices will move. Explain.",

In crash-course training sessions this week, the volunteers learned the basics of how to spot election misinformation, detect bots pushing propaganda and flag potential violations of Twitters rules to the companys policy staff.\n\nSince 2018, the call for volunteers has been part of an all-hands-on-deck approach to major elections, as the companys overstretched content moderators work around-the-clock for a week before and after the vote to stanch the tide of viral falsehoods, intimidation campaigns and foreign influence operations.\n\nBut this election cycle, the company is in greater disarray than ever increasing the risk that cagey political operatives will be able to use the platform to deceive voters or undermine the legitimacy of results. Twitter has weathered a year of managerial chaos since a CEO change, hundreds of employees have reportedly left and a high-level whistleblower warned that the company lacks the resources to enforce its own election policies globally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding to the uncertainty is that billionaire Elon Musk is expected to close his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter by Friday. He has indicated that he will roll back Twitters content moderation efforts, reinstate some of its most notorious purveyors of election lies and lay off as much as 75 percent of its workforce. How his changes will affect Twitters midterm plan is unknown.\n\n\"Given the rapid growth in the scale of disinformation since 2020, its reasonable to doubt whether they can keep up,\" said Edward Perez, Twitters former product director for civic integrity, which includes its election policies. Perez is now a board member at the OSET Institute, a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to election security and election integrity.\n\nTwitter spokesperson Katie Rosborough confirmed the call for volunteers ahead of midterms and said the company had previously done the same during the 2020 U.S. presidential election as well as the recent elections in Brazil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"People use Twitter to find real-time, reliable information about elections, and our investment in this work underscores how seriously we take that responsibility,\" Rosborough said.\n\nDuring a June 16 town hall with Twitter employees, Elon Musk said Twitter users should not be offended but \"very entertained.\" (Video: The Washington Post/Elizabeth Dwoskin)\n\nMusk did not respond to The Washington Posts request for comment about what he will do in his first days of ownership. He visited Twitters San Francisco headquarters on Wednesday to speak with executives and is expected to address employees on Friday. Since launching his takeover bid, he has consistently criticized the company for what he sees as an overly censorial approach to online speech.\n\nMusk has also suggested he might lift the companys ban on former president Donald Trump, whose erratic tweets were capable of rewriting the countrys political agenda on any given day.\n\nFrom the Arab Spring to the Trump presidency to #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, Twitter has played a pivotal role in global politics that belies the companys relatively small size compared with rivals such as Meta and Alphabet. Like its rivals, Twitter began investing more heavily in content moderation following revelations in 2017 of Russian influence campaigns that used social platforms to inflame societal conflicts in the United States ahead of the 2016 presidential election. It has tapped its employees zeal to \"protect the conversation\" around major political events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet it has often seemed overmatched by the hordes of bots and the pace at which lies can ricochet across its platform.\n\nThe midterms have been particularly tricky for social media platforms such as Twitter, in part because hundreds of GOP candidates have embraced Trumps lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Those candidates and their supporters have turned to social media to spread conspiracies about election-rigging.\n\nThe stakes of Twitters decisions are high. Experts have said such misinformation on social media could erode Americans faith in the electoral process. And the companies have to make tough decisions about what content to leave up or take down in a campaign season in which control of both the House and Senate is up for grabs.\n\nIn August, Twitter announced a 2022 midterms plan that largely mimicked the strategies the company deployed in previous election cycles, including promoting accurate information about the election while suppressing the reach of misinformation. Twitter said it would apply misinformation labels or remove posts that undermine confidence in the electoral process, including 2020 claims that the election was rigged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company previously pulled back on this so-called \"civic integrity\" policy after the 2020 election ended, despite internal concern that election deniers were still using it to push lies and distortions, said two people familiar with internal debates, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe them. Rosborough said the company had \"ramped down enforcement\" of its U.S. election policies \"as harms and risks around the contest evolved.\"\n\nThe company also started state-specific event hubs promoting credible news reports about the primaries, creating candidate account labels, and redesigning its labels for misinformed tweets. And it pulled volunteers from across departments away from their normal work in the coming weeks to help safeguard \"the authenticity and integrity of election-related conversation on the platform,\" as the internal #ElectionSquad memo put it.\n\nThe memo asked the volunteers to sign up for four-hour shifts over a two-week period from Nov. 1 to 15. They were also asked to list their foreign-language skills. The audit in the whistleblower report found that Twitter was so short on language capacity that many of its content moderators resorted to Google Translate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosborough said the Election Squad is made up of leaders from different departments at the company who have been meeting regularly for more than a year to prepare for the election. She said the call for volunteers with specific skill sets was a way to \"ensure we had redundancies in place\" at a critical moment, adding that it has \"worked well\" in past elections.\n\nTwitter has also conducted \"a number of table top and threat model exercises around the midterms,\" Rosborough said. She declined to comment on whether the company has planned for what might happen to its election integrity efforts if and when Musk assumes ownership.\n\nTwitter employees involved in the companys efforts around midterms are forging ahead for now, but many are privately worried that Musk could soon halt or undo some of their work.\n\nAdvertisement",

                "cc_text": "The Russian leader often evokes Ivan Ilyin, a philosopher who praised Mussolini and Hitler, but analysts are divided on Putins own ideology.\n\nThe Kremlins master concluded one of his most fateful addresses with a quote from a philosopher barely known outside Russia.\n\n\"Id like to end my speech with the words of a true Russian patriot, Ivan Alexandrovich Ilyin, If I consider Russia my motherland, it means that I love, contemplate and think the Russian way, I sing and speak Russian,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin told politicians on September 30.\n\nThe quote seemed to befit the occasion Putin was announcing the annexation of four Ukrainian regions as an effort to consolidate Russians around his faltering war.\n\nFor years, Putin has been quoting, lionising and promoting Ilyin, who was born in tsarist Russia in 1883 and died in post-WWII Switzerland in 1954.\n\nBut he failed to mention Ilyins political preferences and ideological trajectory.\n\nSome scholars point out that Ilyins works influenced Putins push to transform Russias post-perestroika flawed yet functioning democracy into a bellwether of militant neoconservatism that started this centurys bloodiest war in Europe.\n\n\"There is a fair amount of evidence that Putin admires Ilyins work and ideas,\" Yoshiko Herrera, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studied Ilyins works and their influence on the Kremlins current narrative, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"There are various strands in Ilyins work that might be attractive to Putin, namely the emphasis on a strong state, autocracy and Russian nationalism,\" she said.\n\nAnd Ilyins rejection of the very idea of Ukraines statehood and independence, political or cultural, helps Putin justify the continuing war.\n\n\"Something relevant for recent years is Ilyins anti-Ukrainian views because the denial of Ukrainian nationhood and sovereignty is the key idea underpinning Putins war on Ukraine,\" she said.\n\nHealthy fascism\n\nA century ago, in 1922, a Bolshevik trial sentenced Ilyin, a vehemently anti-Communist scholar of German philosophy, to death.\n\nThe sentence followed six arrests but was cancelled by Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin, who was familiar with Ilyins book on philosopher Georg Hegel, which is still seen as groundbreaking.\n\nIlyin found himself on board the \"philosophers ship\" that left Russia with 140 expelled intellectuals. Like tens of thousands of Russian emigres, he settled in Berlin.\n\nHe rose to become an outspoken ideologue of the monarchist White Movement a loose grouping of anti-Communist forces whose main mouthpiece, The Bell magazine, he edited.\n\nAfter a 1925 trip to Italy, Ilyin championed Benito Mussolinis fascist ideology calling it \"a healthy phenomenon during the advance of leftist chaos\".\n\nIlyin even envied the fact that Italians, not Russians, invented fascism that would soon inspire German Nazis.\n\n\"Ilyin was utterly sad that the ideas of fascism were born not in Russia or among White Russian emigres, where he thought they were natural,\" author Sergei Tarshevsky wrote in July in a column for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n\nIn 1933, Ilyin hailed Adolf Hitlers rise to power which prevented the transformation of Germany into a pro-Soviet Communist state.\n\n\"What has Hitler done? He stopped the process of Bolshevization of Germany and did a greatest favor to all of Europe,\" Ilyin wrote.\n\nAnd although Ilyin had a falling out with the Nazis and moved to Switzerland, his belief in fascism remained unshattered.\n\n\"Italian fascism expressed in its own, Roman way the things that Russia had for centuries been standing on,\" he wrote in 1948.\n\nEven in the smouldering ruins of post-WWII Europe, Ilyin considered the amended ideology of fascism with the addition of Orthodox Christian religiosity the only right ideology for Russia after the (hypothetical at the time) fall of Communism.\n\nIlyin postulated that post-Communist Russia should be ruled by an omnipotent, idolised leader at the helm of a highly centralised state, where elections are nothing but a ritual confirming the public loyalty to the leader.\n\nThe actual voting results did not matter, according to Ilyin.\n\n\"We must reject blind faith in the number of votes and its political significance,\" he wrote.\n\nHe seemed to be describing the Stalinist USSR or perhaps todays Russia.\n\nIlyins views starkly contradicted the official narrative in the Soviet Union, where the 194145 invasion of Nazi Germany and its allies killed 27 million people.\n\nMore than three decades after the Soviet collapse, Moscows \"victory over Nazism\" remains Russias main ideologem.\n\nBut it does not prevent Putin from reading a Nazi sympathiser.\n\nPutins praise\n\n\"You know, I didnt want to say that it was only Ivan Ilyin,\" Putin told a 2021 political forum in response to a question about the thinkers who influenced him.\n\n\"But I read Ilyin, I still do, from time to time. His book is on my shelf,\" he said.\n\nPutin reportedly became a fan of Ilyins works in the early 1980s, when he served as a mid-level KGB spy in pro-Soviet East Germany.\n\nThe Soviets banned the writings of Ilyin and other Russian emigres, and an average Soviet citizen could end up in jail for years for merely owning a copy.\n\nKGB officers were allowed to read banned works, but Putins interest in Ilyin was far from mainstream among his colleagues.\n\n\"Most of the banned works we were reading were pro-democratic,\" Gennady Gudkov, an exiled opposition leader and former officer with the KGB and its main Russian successor, the Federal Security Service, told Al Jazeera.\n\nIlyin was by far not the only figure whose works influenced Putin.\n\n\"I think a person can find extreme views among Ilyins works and you could connect some of Ilyins writings to Putin, but Im not sure that I think Putin is influenced per se by Ilyin, or whether Putin uses Ilyin to bolster some of his own dictatorial fantasies,\" Herrera said.\n\nPutin likes to quote thinkers from Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy to Abraham Lincoln.\n\nHe often refers to Pyotr Stolypin, a tsarist prime minister who conducted sweeping economic reforms at the time of Ilyins youth and never hesitated to use violence to suppress the revolutionary movement in Russia.\n\nPutin also believes in the unorthodox theories of historian Lev Gumilev, who claimed that civilisations rise and fall because of \"bio-cosmic\" mutations.\n\nBut in todays Russia, while they are seen as outspoken figures, Ilyin is more obscure.\n\nIn 2005, when his second presidential term had just begun, Putin arranged to reinter Ilyins remnants.\n\nThey were reburied at the cemetery of Moscows ancient Sretensky Monastery, near the Red Squares mausoleum, where Lenins mummy is still displayed.\n\nA year later, Putin had Ilyins entire archive, including manuscripts and diaries, transferred to Russia from the United States.\n\nIn 2009, Putin laid a bouquet of vermilion roses on the new, granite tombstone on Ilyins grave that he had personally paid for.\n\nThe Russian president was accompanied by his reported confessor, Archimandrite Tikhon, an ultranationalist monarchist who lobbied for the decriminalisation of domestic violence.\n\nBoth were drenched in the rain, but didnt rush to leave.\n\n\"Despite a heavy rain, Putin spent a long time telling Tikhon about the thinker he revers,\" one news report said of the ceremony.\n\nThanks to Putin, Ilyin became \"fashionable\" in the halls of political and spiritual power.\n\nIn 2007, future president and premier Dmitri Medvedev wrote a preface to the reprint of two works by Ilyin.\n\nAll 10,000 copies were donated to libraries throughout Russia.\n\nThe reprint didnt include Ilyins works on fascism.\n\nMoscow Patriarch Kirill, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and former chief ideologue Vladislav Surkov have often quoted Ilyin in their speeches and writings.\n\nOscar-winning filmmaker Nikita Mikhalkov made a 45-minute-long documentary about Ilyin that repeatedly aired on Kremlin-controlled television networks.\n\n\"He was a prophet philosopher,\" Mikhalkov said in the documentary. \"He prophesised the USSRs future after World War II, when Bolshevism will have fallen, with tragic precision.\"\n\nIn 2014, the Kremlin instructed key officials and members of the ruling United Russia party to read Ilyins work titled Our Tasks, the Kommersant daily reported.\n\n\"All [the Kremlins] efforts in the past 15 years were focused on giving a very dubious historic figure an image of a truly Russian philosopher, an exemplary statesman and a true Russian patriot,\" editor and political analyst Anton Barbashin wrote in 2018.\n\nChecking the criteria\n\nPutin was increasingly guided by Ilyins political ideas when reshaping Russias political landscape and biting off parts of Ukraine, according to a renowned US expert on totalitarian ideologies.\n\n\"Mr Putin has relied on Ilyins authority at every turning point in Russian politics from his return to power in 2012 to the decision to intervene in Ukraine in 2013 and the annexation of Ukrainian territory in 2014,\" Timothy Snyder, a history professor at Yale University, wrote in 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin uses the term \"fascism\" to lambast Russias enemies, imaginary or real.\n\nKremlin-controlled media demonises Ukraine as an evil fascist nation or Nazi stronghold that cold-bloodedly conducts a \"genocide\" of Russian-speaking Ukrainians.\n\nShortly after Moscows invasion of Ukraine began, Yales Snyder published an essay titled, We Should Say It. Russia Is Fascist.\n\nThe nation Putin has been ruling for 22 years checks most of the criteria historians apply to fascism, Snyder claimed.\n\n\"It has a cult around a single leader, Vladimir Putin. It has a cult of the dead, organised around World War II. It has a myth of a past golden age of imperial greatness, to be restored by a war of healing violence the murderous war on Ukraine,\" he said.\n\n\"A time traveller from the 1930s would have no difficulty identifying the Putin regime as fascist,\" he said.\n\nSome scholars disagree.\n\n\"Snyder is wrong,\" Nikolay Mitrokhin, a Russia researcher with Germanys Bremen University, told Al Jazeera.\n\nRussia doesnt meet the criteria of a fascist state there is no ideological party, no hysterical cult of the leader, and no revolutionary new regime juxtaposed to the old one.\n\nInstead, in Russia, \"there is an aggressive, imperialist, authoritarian state with a ruling junta\", Mitrokhin said.\n\nSome observers, however, already compare Russias economy with fascist Italys.\n\nBoth attempted to launch a quasi-state capitalism, placed their economic bets on large companies, elevated the states role in the distribution of resources, and relied on \"buying\" electoral loyalty with social and infrastructure projects, Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch said.\n\n\"This is an original Russian neo-fascism,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe stole our ideology\n\nPutins tilt towards neoconservative nationalism became apparent in 2012.\n\nIt followed the largest protests in Russias post-Soviet history, when hundreds of thousands rallied to protest against a rigged parliamentary vote and Putins return to the Kremlin for a third presidency.\n\nThe pivot became obvious after the 2014 annexation of Crimea as the Kremlin incorporated elements of the far-right agenda and began forging a militantly anti-Western, isolationist ideology.\n\n\"The nationalist rhetoric has always been present in the Kremlins political discourse, but of course, it has become more swaggering, insolent, bold after Crimea,\" Andrei Kolesnikov of the Moscow Carnegie Center, a think-tank, told Al Jazeera in 2015.\n\nSeasoned Russian nationalists call it appropriation amid a crackdown on dozens of domestic far-right groups that mushroomed in the early 2000s.\n\n\"The Russian government raises the banner with the ideas we had been fighting for until 2014,\" Rex, who is among a group of fugitive Russian far-right nationalists who have joined the Ukrainian military, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAn outspoken Russian intellectual sees the Kremlins current ideology as fascist and sees it as an epitome of moral degradation of the entire society.\n\n\"Fascism is not an ideological, but moral development. This is the case of resentment, or slave mentality, when people consider themselves offended, morally inadequate for a long time, and begin to revenge the entire world based on this [resentment],\" writer and poet Dmitry Bykov told Radio Liberty in April.\n\nBut Putins apparent adherence to the fascist ideology may not be just verbal.\n\nThe atrocities allegedly committed by Russian troops in Ukraine resemble the tactics of \"total war\" and genocide Hitler prescribed to his troops and allies.\n\nSeveral times over the past eight months, Putin has ordered the indiscriminate bombing of residential areas from Kyiv to Kharkiv to Mariupol.\n\nLooking ahead, the destruction of key infrastructure sites will interrupt heating and power supply to millions of Ukrainians ahead of a cold winter.\n\nAnd as Russian forces keep losing ground in Ukraine, some Kremlin figures describe the war as an existential confrontation with the collective West.\n\nThe West wants to \"liquidate Russia as an independent, sovereign state,\" Sergey Kirienko, former prime minister and current deputy head of the Kremlins administration, told the Itar Tass news agency on Sunday.\n\nHe seems to be echoing Ilyin who wrote that in the case of Ukraines independence from Russia, the smaller neighbour \"will become a source of civil and international wars for centuries\".",

                "cc_text": "Russia's current nuclear blackmail of the world is not an isolated incident but a deliberate policy, and probably its last real point of leverage on the world agenda. After the de facto defeat of the Russian professional army in Ukraine earlier this year, which forced the Kremlin to launch a mass mobilization, Russia has no other means left to make itself be reckoned with. The threat should be taken seriously.\n\nDivided Opinion in Russia Does Not Mean the West Should Let Down Its Guard\n\nIn the past few weeks, the issue of nuclear threat has been brought up again by Moscow. According to the Kremlin, Ukrainian authorities were preparing to use a \"dirty bomb.\" Predictably, Kyiv's Western partners did not believe these accusationsbut the West should not underestimate the Russian regime's ability to commit false flag acts.\n\nFor months now, various \"experts\" on Russian federal TV channels have been preparing Russian audiences for the harshest measures to be taken against unruly Ukraine. The \"dirty bomb\" accusations are an important part of the propaganda. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who is not only a leader of Chechnya but also a recently appointed colonel general of the Rosgvardia, openly declared the use of \"low-yield\" nuclear weapons against Ukraine to be legitimate.\n\nSo far this idea seems to be unpopular even among the most hard-line Russian nationalists. In nationalist circles, Ukraine is viewed as an integral part of the Russian people that has lost its way, so using nuclear weaponry on Ukrainian territory means using it against their own country.\n\nThe Kremlin has a different view. In his recent speech, Russian president Vladimir Putin said that the United States had set a precedent for the use of nuclear weapons, and it seems that his administration is seeking to use them against Ukraine. However, the contradiction remains, since Putin also believes that Ukrainians are Russian and believes that Ukrainian territories should be restored to Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin has accepted the policy based on the self-arrogated right to use force in the former Soviet republics. This policy is connected with the ideas expressed in the Valdai Club's December 2021 programmatic report, Space Without Borders: Russia and Its Neighbours. Its authors openly questioned the existence of Ukraine within its current borders, and sought to justify the use of military force in Ukraine and other former Soviet Union territories. \"Russia has been and remains the dominant power in the so-called post-Soviet space, because it has the largest population, one of the world's best armies, and a large arsenal of nuclear weapons that is commensurate only to the US stockpile,\" the report says.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the report appeared just after Russia delivered its ultimatum to NATO. Thus the report can be considered as referring to the possibility of an open invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDissolution of the Post-Soviet Space: Russia Stands Alone\n\nA year after the release of the Valdai Clubs December 2021 report, it is possible to state that the position of Russia as the dominant force in the post-Soviet space has been shaken and it is about to succumb. Even more, the \"post-Soviet space\" has seemingly ceased to exist. Russia has had to confront its weakness. Hence its dreams (nightmares?) of deploying a nuclear tool.\n\nThis weakness of Russia is especially noticeable in the Southern Caucasus, where Turkeys role has grown. Azerbaijan is under the ever greater influence of Turkey. Once loyal Armenia has become disillusioned with Moscow's ability and willingness to ensure its security. The Central Asian countries are more and more oriented toward China, while some are trying to build relations with the United States and NATO on their own.\n\nTajikistans president Emomali Rakhmon recently appealed to Vladimir Putin at the summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Astana with the demand to change Russias views on its neighboring states. President Rakhmon called on Moscow to respect his country, and while his statement was made in relation to the lack of cooperation between the two countries, it is hard to imagine such a dmarche occurring even a couple of years ago, especially given the postcolonial nature of the relationship and the Kremlin's traditional view of Central Asian leaders as its vassals.\n\nOne can plausibly state that the Russian-led post-Soviet space no longer exists. As in the early 1990s, it is time for Moscow once more to care about the territorial integrity of its own state. In this context, the nuclear button, or any nuclear threat in general, remains the last real card in Putin's deck. That is what makes the situation so dangerous.\n\nRussias Threats to Play the Nuclear Card Must Be Taken Seriously\n\nIn some ways the tense situation resembles the situation in Ukrainian politics in 2021, when the coming Russian attack was almost palpable. That year President Volodymyr Zelensky's office began to cleanse the political space of pro-Russia political forces. For the first time since 2014, when the conflict with Russia started, pro-Russia political groups felt a real threat and restrictions on their activities. A number of media resources financed by these groups were also closed down.\n\nAt the same time, it became clear that Kyiv would not comply with the Kremlins interpretations of the Minsk Agreements, which would have allowed it to introduce pro-Russia forces into the political system of Ukraine through proxy structures created in the Donbas. This is when the Kremlin understood that it had only one way to force Ukraine into submissionby using military force.\n\nDespite the obvious fact that the number of professional Russian army units was insufficient to defeat the Ukrainian army and effect regime change quickly, Putin decided to take this risk. Now he has met a series of humiliating defeats in Ukraine and in many other, once Soviet, regions. He is forced to reckon with his regimes future in a way that involves wide strata of the Russian population and risks plunging the entire economy into a long, devastating war. It is unclear whether Vladimir Putin has drawn any lessons from his Ukrainian adventure or whether he is prepared to raise the stakes in his confrontation with the West.\n\nThe new dictionary that the Kremlin started using recently, which includes the Iranian theocracys term \"the Wests Satanism\" and Patriarch Kirills concept of \"globalism the Antichrist,\" shows that any threat that Putin makes, even a fantastic one, should be taken seriously and responded to as wisely and as preemptively as possible.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those solely of the author and do not reflect the views of the Kennan Institute.",

Russias Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu held talks with many of his global counterparts, including Rajnath Singh, accusing Ukraine of potential \"nuclear terrorism\". A dirty bomb is not a nuclear bomb but a conventional explosive device with radioactive materials, the explosion of which could turn swathes of land uninhabitable for decades. Ukraine and its western backers have rejected the Russian allegations, saying the Russians, who have suffered setbacks, are making unfounded claims for a false flag attack. It is difficult to ascertain what is going on behind the fog of a full-scale war, but the talk of dirty bombs and nuclear terrorism does not bode well. Ever since the U.S.s nuclear bombing of Japan in 1945, the world has largely treated the nuclear option as taboo. Even in 1962, when the Soviet Union and the U.S. were on the brink of conflict, their leaders managed to end the crisis amicably through dialogue. But unfortunately, Vladimir Putins threat of using all means available to him to protect his country and Joe Bidens warning of a \"nuclear Armageddon\" are tantamount to normalising the nuclear option in the middle of a conflict that is in an escalatory spiral.\n\nWhat is more surprising is that even as the war is steadily deteriorating, there is no conscious effort by any side to start a dialogue. Russia says it is ready for talks but has not given any concrete proposals, and its offer for talks cannot be trusted, especially after it announced the annexation of four partially controlled Ukrainian regions. Ukraine says it will not hold talks with Russia as long as Mr. Putin is in power and that it intends to fight till all Ukrainian regions are liberated, including Crimea. Ukraines western backers say they would continue to support Ukraines resistance \"as long as it takes\". As all sides take maximalist positions, escalation is creating its own dynamic, taking the whole world hostage. Eight months of war have already created economic and humanitarian disasters. And there are greater fears of a direct conflict between Russia and NATO, two nuclear forces. What more do the stakeholders of this war want before they actually begin serious talks? They should realise that unchecked escalation with an open possibility of a Russia-NATO war would be catastrophic for the whole world. The stakes are higher than their geopolitical goals. The rhetoric on nuclear attacks and retaliation should stop immediately and Russia, Ukraine and the West should begin talks to end the conflict. The alternative would be cataclysmic.\n\nTo read this editorial in Hindi, click here.\n\nTo read this editorial in Tamil, click here.",

                "cc_text": "A series of allegations and actions by Russia on Monday sparked fresh fears in Washington that President Vladimir Putin was considering escalating his bloody war in Ukraine.\n\nWithout providing any evidence, the Kremlin publicly alleged that Ukraine was planning to detonate an explosive device mixed with radioactive material on its own territory with the intention of blaming Moscow. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces were being prepared to operate in conditions of radioactive contamination due to threats of this purported attack using such a device, colloquially called a \"dirty bomb.\"\n\nThe allegations were roundly dismissed in Kyiv, Washington and European capitals, where leaders warned that Moscow was attempting to create a pretext for its own escalation, possibly carrying out a so-called \"false-flag\" operation that would inflict mass casualties and environmental contamination. It is a well-established Kremlin tactic to launch devastating attacks and then blame its enemies for the casualties. \"If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared it,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a video address.\n\nThe White House on Monday expressed concern regarding Russias dirty bomb claims and rejected the notion that Kyiv was preparing such an attack. \"There is no plan by the Ukrainians to do this, so, of course, that gives us concern and were obviously taking the issue seriously,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. \"All I can assure you is that we are taking it seriously and we are monitoring as best we can.\"\n\nRead More: Fears Over Military Miscalculation Grow In Ukraine\n\nDetonation of a dirty bomb has been a top U.S. government concern for decades. Until now, the fear has centered on a terrorist obtaining highly radioactive materialsfrom a hospital for medical imaging or other scientific purposesand packing it around an explosive charge. The force of the initial blast would be only as deadly as that of a conventional bomb, but the scattering of radioactive debris would be even more deadly and could injure victims with radiation poisoning. Because the technical challenge doesnt involve splitting an atom, the bombs are easier to construct. The devices are smallpotentially fitting in a suitcase, for instance, and still capable of contaminating several city blocks. A 2004 study conducted by the National Defense University found that the economic impact of a dirty bomb could exceed those incurred after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe White House said the U.S. would be able to detect preparations for the staging of dirty bomb attack through reconnaissance satellites, communication intercepts and other intelligence instruments, but acknowledged there would be challenges to how much advance warning they would be able to provide. \"A lot of our ability to detect would be determined by a range of factors including the length of time that the perpetrators prepare for communications\" and the time involved in building such a device, Kirby said. \"When I say we are not seeing any preparations, its that we are not seeing any physical preparations.\"\n\nIts unclear what, if any, use a dirty bomb would have on the battlefield. Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, noted that Russian officials have repeatedly warned that Ukraine was preparing a weapon of mass destructioneven before their unprovoked Feb. 24 invasion. At various points throughout the year Moscow has falsely alleged that Ukraine was: seeking a stockpile of its own nuclear warheads; used botulinum toxin to poison Russian soldiers; and operated a network biological weapons laboratories with U.S. support. The dirty bomb claim \"seems to be a claim on par with the biolabs accusationscreate a lot of innuendo and muddy the waters,\" Podvig says. \"And, of course, a bonus is that anything nuclear-related makes people nervous.\"\n\nRead More: Inside the $100 Billion Mission to Modernize Americas Aging Nuclear Missiles\n\nIts possible that Russia is considering a \"false-flag\" operation by leveling these accusations in such a public manner, but Moscow could also be trying to lay the groundwork for their own escalation, says Olga Oliker, the International Crisis Groups director for Europe and Central Asia. \"Perhaps they also just wanted to plant more doubts about Ukraine in the global press, as well as more concerns about the risk of escalation in this war,\" she says.\n\nOn Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry took to Telegram to outline how Ukraine maintained the scientific and industrial capabilities to create a dirty bomb. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Moscow was engaging in \"nuclear blackmail,\" inviting international monitors to see for themselves that his forces had no such plans.\n\nThe post came a day after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu made a flurry of phone calls with his counterparts in France, Britain, Turkey and the U.S. about the alleged coming dirty bomb attack. The Western governments issued a joint statement late Sunday, which dismissed Russias transparently allegations. \"The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a non-profit think tank in Washington, assessed that Russia was \"unlikely to be preparing an imminent false-flag dirty bomb attack,\" but has warned that Russian forces may be planning another covert operation by blowing up a hydroelectric dam in southern Ukraine. If an attack on the dam did take place, it would flood areas around the southern region of Kherson, cut water supplies to people living there and threaten the cooling system for Europes largest nuclear plant.\n\nGeneral Sergei Surovikin, Russias new chief commander in Ukraine, warned last week that Ukraine could attack the dam and imperil his troops, many of whom are retreating from Kherson. The retreat is just one of several embarrassing military setbacks for Moscow. In response, the Russian military has unleashed missile and drone strikes on energy plants and civilian targets, triggering fears that hostilities were escalating and inching the world closer to the brink of nuclear war.\n\nWrite to W.J.

Sputnik/Sergei Karpukhin, via Reuters\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin, in a speech seemingly aimed more at winning over political conservatives abroad than his own citizens, declared on Thursday that Russias battle was with \"Western elites,\" not with the West itself.\n\nMr. Putin, addressing an annual foreign policy conference outside Moscow, appeared intent on capitalizing on political divisions in the United States and its allies that have only heightened since they began showering Ukraine with military aid to fend off the Russian invasion.\n\nMany of the themes of the Russian leaders speech were familiar, but they took on particular resonance given the coming midterm elections in the United States and growing discontent in Europe over the costs of the war.\n\n\"There are at least two Wests,\" Mr. Putin said.\n\nOne, he said, is a West of \"traditional, mainly Christian values\" with which Russians feel kinship. But, he said, \"theres another West aggressive, cosmopolitan, neocolonial, acting as the weapon of the neoliberal elite,\" and trying to impose its \"pretty strange\" values on the rest of the world.\n\nMr. Putin, as he often does, portrayed Russia as threatened by the possible expansion of NATO and the values of its liberal democracies to include countries like Ukraine that were once part of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe denied that Moscow was preparing to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. \"We have no need to do this,\" he said. \"Theres no sense for us, neither political nor military.\"\n\nIt is Mr. Putin himself, however, who has raised that prospect, as have other senior Russian officials. And Kremlin assurances have proved unreliable. In the days before the war began, for example, Russia denied that it planned to invade Ukraine.\n\n\"This is a trick it shouldnt make anyone relax,\" said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political analyst, noting that Mr. Putin has blamed the West and its support for an independent Ukraine for every escalation in the war. \"His goal is to show that escalation is the product of Western policies.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, officials ridiculed Mr. Putins speech. Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, said the Russian president was accusing the West of what he has been doing himself, chiefly violating another countrys sovereignty.\n\n\"Any speech by Putin can be described in two words: for Freud,\" Mr. Podolyak posted on Twitter.",

It was the first time the Russian leader made the claim, which Western officials have dismissed, suggesting Moscow could use it as a pretext for launching its own attack.\n\nAt the same time, the Russian military conducted an annual exercise involving land, sea and air field tests of its missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.\n\nState television broadcast short clips of the launches as well as an excerpt from Mr. Putin receiving a briefing from Russias defense minister, Sergei K.

U.S. officials said that Russias annual strategic exercises started Wednesday morning and that they appeared routine, \"with all customary notifications in place.\"\n\nBut Mr. Putins claim, coupled with the military exercises, added to the concerns of a possible escalation of the war in Ukraine, a day after President Biden warned Mr. Putin that it would be \"an incredibly serious mistake\" to use a tactical nuclear weapon in the conflict.\n\nA dirty bomb is not a nuclear device, but Mr. Bidens warning reflected the increasingly urgent concern in Washington and among Western allies that Russia may be searching for a pretext to unleash a tactical nuclear weapon.\n\nImage A still image from a video released by the Russian Defense Ministry on Wednesday shows what it said was an intercontinental ballistic missile launched during exercises in Russia. Credit... Russian Defense Ministry, via Reuters\n\nOn Wednesday, in a video address to a conference of intelligence chiefs from heads of the security agencies from former Soviet states, Mr. Putin accused Washington of supplying Ukraine with \"heavy weapons\" and said that the risk of conflict was high in the region and around the world. Security should be heightened around key infrastructure sites, he said.\n\n\"It is also known about plans to use a so-called dirty bomb for provocation,\" a Kremlin summary of the message quoted Mr. Putin as saying.\n\nRussia has not made public any evidence to substantiate its dirty bomb accusation against Ukraine.\n\nAntony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, said Wednesday during a public talk at the Bloomberg News bureau in Washington that the United States continued to watch for any moves by Russia to escalate the war in Ukraine, including with nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We havent seen a reason to change our own nuclear posture,\" Mr. Blinken said. \"But its something were tracking very carefully, and weve also communicated directly and very clearly to the Russians, to President Putin, about the consequences\" that would follow from \"any use of a nuclear device.\"\n\nValeriya Safronova , Mujib Mashal , Edward Wong and Julian E.

And so there's heightened concern tonight that Russia is the one planning to deploy a radiological device in Ukraine.\n\nNumber two, Moscow has created the conditions that, according to its own doctrine, could lead to a preemptive nuclear strike, threats to territory that Putin has claimed is Russia. That's Ukrainian territory that he has illegally annexed and now claims of a weapons of mass destruction threat, again, to that quote, unquote \"Russian territory.\"\n\nRussian strategy is what the U.S. calls escalate to de-escalate. And so this would be an example, U.S. officials fear, of Russia escalating with a radiological device, in order to try and convince Kyiv to come to the negotiating table. They're also worried, according to one senior administration official I spoke to today, is that a dirty bomb is quote \"easily concealable,\" could be very small, and that quote \"We should be humble about whether we will be able to know that this dirty bomb is coming.\"\n\nBut a couple of notes of caution, Judy, that are really important. One, it is not clear that Russia actually has a radiological device on the shelf ready to use.

Around 25,000 people have already left Kherson city for the left bank of the Dnipro River, according to Russian-appointed officials in Kherson.\n\nHere are the top developments. advertisement Kherson was one of the regions annexed by Russia. The port city, which had a pre-war population of about 280,000, is the largest urban centre Russia still holds since capturing it early in the invasion of Ukraine eight months ago. Ukraine has launched a swift counteroffensive to take back Kherson. A senior Ukrainian official has predicted \"the heaviest of battles\" between Russia and Ukraine for the port city, Reuters reported.\n\nOf the four provinces that Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed, Kherson is arguably the most strategically important. It controls both the only land route to the Crimea peninsula, which Russia seized in 2014, and the mouth of the Dnipro, the vast river that bisects Ukraine. A defeat for Russia in Kherson would be one of its biggest setbacks in the conflict.\n\nThe Russian-backed administration of Kherson have evacuated thousands of civilians by boat to the eastern bank of the Dnipro from the west bank as the battle for Kherson loomed.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has accused Ukraine of plotting to use 'dirty bomb' against its forces, an allegation that was dismissed by Kyiv and the West as misinformation and a pretext for intensifying the war. \"I don't mind people saying that Russia is crying wolf if this doesn't happen because this is a terrible, terrible disaster that threatens potentially the whole of the Earth,\" Russian envoy told United Nations Security Council on Tuesday. Read | Kyiv preparing to use dirty bomb in Ukraine: Rebuffed by western countries, Russia brings matter to UNSC\n\nRussia also hinted that it might be forced to use a tactical nuclear weapon against Ukraine if Kyiv drops a 'dirty bomb' on Ukrainian forces. A 'dirty bomb' is designed to contaminate a wide area with radioactive material, making it dangerous for civilians. It does not involve a nuclear explosion.\n\nadvertisement Responding to the Russian tactical nuclear threat, US President Joe Biden said any nuke attack would be a \"serious mistake\". Russia would be making an incredibly serious mistake were it to use a tactical nuclear weapon, he said. The US suspects Russia might itself use a dirty bomb in a \"false flag\" attack, possibly to justify the use of conventional nuclear weapons by Moscow. I'm not guaranteeing that it's a false flag operation yet. We don't know, Biden added.

Ukraine suspects that Russia is preparing an attack using nuclear materials and radioactive waste stored at the plant.\n\nadvertisement As per the UN's human rights office, over 6,000 civilians, including 397 children, have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine. But these numbers are likely a significant undercount, and the death toll is expected to be much higher, driving home the reality of the brutal conflict.\n\nSince Russian forces suffered major defeats in September, Putin has doubled down, calling up hundreds of thousands of reservists, announcing the annexation of occupied territory and repeatedly threatening to use nuclear weapons.\n\nadvertisement Recent missile and drone strikes have knocked out more than 40 per cent of Ukraines power-generating capabilities, leading to energy rationing and blackouts throughout the country. They signal the start of what could be a cold, dark winter in Ukraine as war rages on.

                "cc_text": "Russias Brutal War of Choice Deals Blow to European Security\n\nThe Middle East could not continue to sit idly by with its hands tied while ignoring the severity of the regions deteriorating security situation, the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) heard today, as it concluded its thematic debate on regional security and started consideration of the disarmament aspects of outer space.\n\nMissing another opportunity to construct a consensus-based security architecture that included a zone free from nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, said Egypts representative, would lead to catastrophic consequences. The Middle East remained among the worlds most volatile regions, worsened by the spread of conflicts, proxy wars, terrorism and sectarian violence. It was presently witnessing a new chapter of an alarming arms race.\n\nThe region was \"on fire\", agreed Irans speaker, who said that a regional security framework was needed there now more than ever. The presence of extra-regional players exacerbated the situation. One of the biggest concerns was the proliferation of mass-destruction weapons in the region, he said, pointing to what he called the Israeli regimes \"reliance\" on military aid from the United States, as well as its aggressive military establishment, which was a \"chronic source\" of regional insecurity.\n\nSeveral European speakers voiced concern about threats to the security architecture in Europe. Frances representative said the world was witnessing the gradual erosion of the conventional arms control regime, warning that its three main pillars had already been weakened and were now directly affected by the war in Ukraine. Disarmament carried out at regional and subregional levels was complementary to those carried out globally. She cited, for example, the cross-border nature of illicit small arms and light weapons flows.\n\n\"Russias brutal war of choice was a devastating blow to the security architecture based on international law\", said the representative of Poland. By its aggression against Ukraine, the Russian Federation had decided to launch a period of chaos and uncertainty. That followed years of that countrys constant undermining of key frameworks which constituted the regional security architecture. It had \"weakened the overall credibility of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation\".\n\nEstonias representative similarly asserted that the Russian Federations unprovoked aggression had changed the European security architecture. That country had gone from selectively implementing its arms control obligations to completely violating nearly all of them. Threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity and independence of any State under any pretext were threats to the entire world, she said, urging the Russian Federation to withdraw all troops and military equipment from Ukraine.\n\nWhen the debate began on the disarmament aspects of outer space, some speakers warned that existing treaties, including draft treaties and other instruments, on preventing the first deployment of weapons in outer space were deficient, as they did not define what a weapon in outer space was, nor address the challenge of verification. The representative of Australia, for example, highlighted that the issue must be adequately addressed, particularly in relation to dual-use space objects. The technical challenge of verifying the attributes of any object in space to assess whether or not it was a weapon was indeed significant, the speaker said.\n\nOn behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesias representative voiced serious concern at the negative security consequences of deployment of strategic missile defence systems in outer space, which could trigger an arms race and lead to further development of advanced missile systems and an increase in the number of nuclear weapons. While voluntary transparency and confidence-building measures might partially contribute to reducing mistrust and enhancing the safety of outer space operations in the short-term, they were no substitute for a legally binding instrument.\n\nThe Committee also heard during the day from the Chair of the Open-Ended Working Group on Security of and in the Use of Information and Communications Technologies 20212024, as well as from the Chief of the Regional Disarmament, Information and Outreach Branch, United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, who spoke on behalf of the Directors of the United Nations Regional Centres for Peace and Disarmament.\n\nSpeaking during the discussion on regional disarmament were representatives of Brunei Darussalam (on behalf of (ASEAN)), Iraq (on behalf of the Arab Group), Indonesia, United States, Australia, Philippines, Ukraine, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, Estonia, Bangladesh, Iran, Algeria, United Kingdom, Iraq, Malaysia, Niger, Nepal, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Greece, Jordan and Brazil, as well as the European Union, in its capacity as observer.\n\nExercising the right of reply were representatives of the Russian Federation, China, Israel, Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, Azerbaijan, Syria, Republic of Korea, Iran, United States, Armenia and Saudi Arabia, as well as the European Union, in its capacity as observer.\n\nSpeaking during the discussion on outer space were representatives of Nigeria on behalf of the African Group, Malaysia (on behalf of (ASEAN)), Iraq (on behalf of the Arab Group), Russian Federation (on behalf of a group of countries), Canada, Indonesia, France, Austrailia and Egypt, as well as the European Union, in its capacity as observer.\n\nExercising the right of reply on the outer space debate were representatives of the Russian Federation and United States.\n\nThe Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 October, to continue its thematic debates on outer space.\n\nOther Disarmament Measures and International Security\n\nBURHAN GAFOOR (Singapore), Chair, Open-Ended working Group on Security of and in the Use of Information and Communications Technologies 2021-2024, noted that the Group had convened three substantive sessions thus far, where Member States had agreed on a set of modalities. They also had a robust exchange on all six pillars of the Groups mandate, which had led to the adoption, by consensus, of its first annual progress report in July. All six pillars of the mandate was reflected in the report. The reports first section reflected on discussions on the topic, the second, on recommended next steps. A section on threats noted the increase in incidents involving the malicious use of information and communications technology (ICT) by State and non-State actors, as well as the implications of harmful ICT activity on various fronts, including critical infrastructure. The sections on norms, international law, confidence-building measures, capacitybuilding and regular institutional dialogue reflected a non-exhaustive list of various concrete, action-oriented proposals. One concrete initiative under confidence-building measures was the agreement to establish a global, intergovernmental, points-of-contact directory.\n\nThe Group itself, he said, was a confidence-building mechanism and the annual progress report served as a road map to ensure that the measures remained effective and benefitted all Member States. Singapore had tabled a draft decision for the First Committees consideration under agenda item 94, seeking the General Assemblys endorsement of the annual progress report. Adoption of the decision by consensus would reinforce the consensus reached at the Groups third substantive session.\n\nRegional Disarmament and Security\n\nNOOR QAMAR SULAIMAN ( Brunei Darussalam ), speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said that strengthening the Association was a regional priority. ASEAN strongly supported the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Additionally, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was an historic agreement contributing to global nuclear disarmament. Nuclear-weapon States should fulfil their obligations leading to the elimination of those weapons. South-East Asia was a nuclear-weapon-free zone with a Treaty enshrined in ASEANs charter. She advocated for the establishment of more zones, particularly in the Middle East. All parties also should work towards reaching a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. Through the ASEAN Network of Regulatory Bodies on Atomic Energy, the region strengthened nuclear safety. She reaffirmed its commitment to the Biological Weapons Convention, attaching special importance to enhancing regional cooperation, assistance and technology exchanges for peaceful purposes. ASEAN valued regional platforms to facilitate implementation of commitments and would work towards the goal of global disarmament and a world without nuclear weapons.\n\nSARMAD MUWAFAQ MOHAMMED AL-TAIE ( Iraq ), speaking on behalf of the Arab Group and associating with the Non-Aligned Movement, said that the Middle East required greater efforts to bolster disarmament. The Group stressed the crucial importance of creating nuclear-weapon-free zones throughout the world, including in the Middle East. In that regard, it underscored the importance of adopting effective and immediate measures. All efforts would be expended to ensure a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East to achieve security and stability in one of the most conflict-ridden areas of the world. The Arab States had carried out their responsibilities, and other parties must follow suit. He was greatly concerned at Israels continued refusal to join the NPT, the only country in the region outside the Treaty, as well as its refusal to place its nuclear installations under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. Any delays in implementing the 1995 resolution on creating a zone free of nuclear weapons and mass destruction weapons in the Middle East would be a step backwards in nuclear disarmament.\n\nMICHAL KARCZMARZ, representative of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, stated that the Russian Federations unprovoked, unjustified and illegal war of aggression was one of the greatest challenges to global peace and security. It undermined the international rules-based order, and among other things, damaged the global economy and global food security in ways which harmed all countries. The Union had a long history of support for actions that addressed threats to international and regional security and promoted disarmament. The diversion, illicit trade and unauthorized use of conventional arms, especially small arms and light weapons and their ammunition was a serious impediment to global peace, security and sustainable development, he added.\n\nHe said that the Union was assisting numerous small arms and light weapons control projects, most with a regional scope and implemented with the help of regional organizations. Some projects built capacity for arms export control, which was crucial in preventing diversion of those weapons into the wrong hands. Demobilization and reintegration of former combatants were essential in stabilization and lasting peace. Indeed, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration was an integral part of the Unions contribution to the non-recurrence of violence and to broader stabilization, as that process addressed the risks posed by armed groups and supported the transition from armed confrontation to political engagement and inclusive governance.\n\nSUDJADNAN PARNOHADININGRAT ( Indonesia ), associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and ASEAN, said that nuclear-weapon-free zones were indispensable to achieving nuclear disarmament. Nuclear-weapon States should provide unconditional assurances to the countries in those zones and ratify all relevant treaties and their protocols. Nuclear-weapon-free zones were essential building blocks, and Indonesia reaffirmed its commitment to preserve Southeast Asia as nuclear-weapon-free, as enshrined in the ASEAN charter. More such zones should be established around the world, particularly in the Middle East. Regional efforts maintained the global security architecture. Moreover, he advocated for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the achievement of a world free of nuclear weapons.\n\nMOHAMED KAMAL ALI ELHOMOSANY ( Egypt ), associating with the Arab Group and Non-Aligned Movement, said the Middle East remained among the worlds most volatile regions, worsened by the spread of conflicts, proxy wars, terrorism and sectarian violence. Peace in that region could not be achieved under deterrence and weapons accumulations, but rather, through engagement. A Middle East zone free of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons could save the region and the world from devastating wars, horrors and chronic country-specific proliferation concerns. Ignoring the severity of the regions deteriorating security would only lead to catastrophic consequences. The region already witnessed a new chapter of a gravely alarming arms race. \"We cannot continue to stand idly watching with our hands tied,\" he said. Member States should not miss another opportunity to engage constructively, inclusively and in a consensus-based way to stop the violence and chaos.\n\nCAMILLE PETIT ( France ) was concerned about the threats to the European security architecture, as the world witnessed the gradual erosion of the conventional-arms-control regime. The three main pillars of the regime had already been weakened and were now directly affected by the war in Ukraine. The Russian Federation, after years of circumventing and instrumentalizing its obligations and commitments under confidence- and security-building measures, had knowingly violated them by aggressing against Ukraine. She stressed the importance of non-proliferation and disarmament initiatives carried out at the regional and subregional levels: they were by nature complementary to those carried out at globally, and they contributed to international peace, security and stability. Such was the case, for example, with regard to preventing and combating the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons, given the largely cross-border nature of those flows. She encouraged regional and subregional cooperation.\n\nBRUCE I. TURNER ( United States ) condemned the Russian Federation's attacks against civilian infrastructure and cities across Ukraine in the strongest possible terms and demanded that it withdraw all its troops and military equipment from that country. He rejected the Russian Federations illegal attempts to seize its neighbours land and property. He also remained deeply concerned with Chinas increasing military, diplomatic and economic pressure campaign against Taiwan. Iran's continued nuclear escalations underlined the importance of robust verification, which remained the foundation of any lasting deal, as well as the essential role of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Syria's persistent refusal to hear IAEA calls for cooperation to remedy its long-standing safeguards and ensure compliance had been ongoing for more than a decade and remained a matter of serious concern. He said his country was prepared to engage in diplomacy with the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea towards the objective of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Overall, he said the United States was strongly committed to the implementation of the women, peace and security agenda, which reinforced the disarmament agenda.\n\nHEATHER MCINTYRE ( Australia ), associating with the European Union, said her country attached great importance to the contribution of nuclear-weapon-free zones to global nuclear disarmament. Steadfast in her commitment to the South Pacific Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (Rarotonga Treaty), she commended other regions efforts to establish such zones, including in South-East Asia. She expressed concern about the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas continued development of its nuclear and ballisticmissile programme and the effect on the region, and urged that country to comply with relevant Security Council resolutions. Australia was strongly committed to ASEAN, as illustrated by its deepening partnership in such areas as cybersecurity, maritime security and disaster response. The \"Pacific family\" had jointly built a long history of cooperation in the areas of border management and defence. Australias cybersecurity depended on that of the region and the wider international community, and it would continue to work with South-East Asian and Pacific countries to improve cyberresilience. \"Regional and international security were two sides of the same coin,\" and Australia would continue to work with its partners to address common challenges.\n\nALEKSANDER SZEWCZUK ( Poland ), associating with the statement delivered by the European Union delegation, said that \"Russias brutal war of choice was a devastating blow to the security architecture based on international law\". By its aggression against Ukraine, the Russian Federation had decided to launch a period of chaos and uncertainty. That came after years of that countrys constant undermining of key frameworks which constituted the regional security architecture. The Russian Federation had withdrawn from its commitments under the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty and the Open Skies Treaty. Indeed, its actions \"have weakened the overall credibility of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation\". Poland noted with concern the \"spillover effects of the Russian aggression\" around the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) space. The responsibility for its actions lay also on Belarus, he said, adding \"if not for Minsks support, Russias aggression would have been limited\".\n\nDIANE SHAYNE DELA FUENTE LIPANA ( Philippines ), associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and ASEAN, said international and regional components of the global governance regime were important to ensure an open, inclusive and rules-based order, based on international law. Regional security architecture was upheld by regional mechanisms and institutions, and she commended ASEAN for its inclusive, responsible, consensus-based and confidence-building work on that front. Global and regional assistance was important for mine action and achieving sustainable development. The Philippines had contributed actively to the work of the Open-Ended Working Group on space threats. South-East Asia should be preserved as region free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, and she looked forward to solving outstanding issues in line with the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (Bangkok Treaty). Bridging differences and engaging with nuclear-weapon States was important. Those countries should rapidly agree to reduce stockpiles and achieve complete elimination. Regional approaches complemented each other and should be pursued simultaneously. That complementarity was a two-way street which went hand in hand with global norms.\n\nANATOLII ZLENKO ( Ukraine ) stated that the Russian Federations unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine was the greatest challenge to international peace and security since the end of the Second World War. Almost 28 years ago, Ukraine had relinquished its nuclear weapons in exchange for security assurances confirmed by the United Kingdom, United States, and the Russian Federation in the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in connection with Ukraines accession to the NPT. The Budapest Memorandum was a crucial political and legal step for the young Ukrainian State. Ukraine had fulfilled its obligations within the Memorandum to the full extent, by implementing a complex of range of multifaceted nuclear disarmament measures. Later, the Russian Federation brutally violated the provisions of the Budapest Memorandum. It was the Russian Federation that used phosphorus munitions and anti-personnel mines and the entire arsenal of conventional weapons against civilians and civilian infrastructure. That country should immediately cease aggression against Ukraine and unconditionally withdraw all its forces and military equipment from Ukraines entire territory, within its internationally recognized borders.\n\nMOHAMMAD AAMIR KHAN ( Pakistan ) reaffirmed the need for the simultaneous pursuit of regional and global approaches, including agreements in the areas of disarmament and arms limitation. The ultimate aim of regional approaches should be to enhance regional and global peace and security. Confidence-building measures could lead to favourable measures for the peaceful settlement of disputes, as well as facilitate solutions to situations which might cause international friction. However, confidence-building measures were not a goal in themselves and should be pursued in conjunction with earnest efforts for peaceful dispute settlement in line with the Charter. A stable balance of conventional forces and weapons was necessary to ensure strategic stability. For several years, Pakistan had spearheaded initiatives to promote regional disarmament and conventional arm control. It would present a resolution on confidence-building measures in the regional and subregional context. The text recognized the significance of complementarity between regional and global approaches to arms control, disarmament and confidence-building to peace, security and stability.\n\nKONSTANTIN VORONTSOV ( Russian Federation ) said that the reason for the decline in military security in Europe was the policy pursued by the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies towards confrontation with the Russian Federation, undermining the foundations of European security and disrupting a resilient and credible system of arms control and confidence-building measures. The United States was pumping more weapons and intelligence into Ukraine, and its actions were bringing the situation to a dangerous prospect of direct military stand-off between the Russian Federation and NATO. For several decades, the United States and its NATO allies continued working on disrupting and dismantling key arms control and confidence-building agreements. In 2003, Washington, D.C., unilaterally terminated the Soviet-American Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In the early 2000s, it refused to ratify the Agreement on Adaptation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.\n\nIn that context, he said, subsequent calls to increase transparency through further modernization of the Vienna Document, which Western colleagues had repeatedly requested for many years, seemed, at the least insincere. After that, the United States had adopted a course towards the destruction of the Treaty on Open Skies, which led to its unilateral withdrawal under a far-fetched pretext. The Russian Federation had repeatedly proposed de-escalation measures, including the reduction in military activities along the border of the Russian Federation and NATO countries on a reciprocal basis, along with improved mechanisms for the prevention of incidents at sea and in the air, as well as a reduction of dangerous military activities.\n\nKIM IN CHOL ( Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea ) said that it was encouraging that, in many parts of the world, efforts were concentrated on creating and further consolidating nuclear-weapon-free zones. Bilateral and multilateral disarmament measures were actively pursued to address mutual security concerns. The Korean Peninsula was one of those regions where the risk of war constantly hovered, owing to the territorial and national division caused by the 80-year-long occupation of \"South Korea\" by the United States forces. His country had put forward sustained efforts to implement numerous proposals for confidence-building and to defuse the acute security crisis on the Korean Peninsula, as well as to ensure lasting peace and stability. But, the United States responded with a vicious, hostile policy and used nuclear threats as blackmail, he said, by conducting different sorts of joint military exercises against his country and in and around the Korean Peninsula. In 1954, the United States had staged a joint military exercise, the first of its kind. In recent years, the United States and \"South Korea\" had undertaken many joint military exercises. That showed that the United States was the main actor undermining peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the North-East Asian region. It taught a lesson that disarmament in the region could never be realized by unilateral efforts alone.\n\nKATRI LHMUS ( Estonia ), associating with the statement delivered by the European Union delegation, stressed that the Russian Federations \"contempt\" for Ukraine's national borders and sovereignty \"cannot and will not be accepted\". Threats to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of any State under any pretext were threats to the entire world, she said, urging the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw all its troops and military equipment from Ukraines territory. The Russian Federations attacks were in clear violation of international humanitarian law and were carried out with weapons from Iran. She urged all nations not to assist the aggressor in its commission of war crimes and condemned the further involvement of Belarus in aiding the attack on Ukraine. The Russian Federations unprovoked aggression had changed the European security architecture. The Russian Federation had gone from selectively implementing its arms control obligations to completely violating nearly all of them, she added.\n\nMD MONWAR HOSSAIN ( Bangladesh ), associating with the Non-Aligned Movement, said peaceful dialogue and diplomacy remained the best options for building regional security architectures. Establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones as interim measures was vital. Regarding the Middle East, he called on all regional States to actively participate in the zones establishment. Unconditional and legally binding assurances by nuclear-weapon States was a high priority. The United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Development facilitated the identification of common interests and concerns among countries in his region during negotiations on disarmament treaties. Learning from other regional good practices would help prevent weapons of mass destruction proliferation and avoid their possible acquisition by terrorists and other non-State entities. Disarmament education helped to change the basic attitudes of peoples and policymakers, and he called for the Regional Centre to strengthen its disarmament education and research. Bangladesh was committed to advancing regional disarmament as an essential and integral part of building a safer and better world for all.\n\nHEIDAR ALI BALOUJI ( Iran ) stated that the number of active armed conflicts that took place in at least 46 States in 2021 was \"plainly shocking\". Eight of those had erupted in the Middle East alone. A regional security framework was needed there now more than ever, because the region was \"on fire\". The presence of extra regional players, as well as interference in the region, exacerbated the situation. Unsurprisingly, the United States was the number-one arms seller to some regional countries. The Israeli regime relied on its military aid from the United States, as well as the aggressive military establishment it created, which was a chronic source of regional insecurity. One of the biggest concerns was the proliferation of massdestruction weapons in the region. The Israeli regime was the only entity in the region that refused to accede to the NPT or to the Biological and Chemical Weapons Conventions. Chemical weapons had been frequently and massively used in the region. Irans nuclear programme was completely peaceful, and it rejected any allegation or politicized approach on the matter. The United States, with its history of sustained non-compliance with numerous accords, including the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action, lacked any moral ground to raise unacceptable statements, he said. He rejected any claims that Iran played a role in the war in Ukraine. Iran had the right to meet its security and military needs.\n\nNAZIM KHALDI ( Algeria ), associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group, said his country was deeply involved in consolidating regional stability and building a better future for the region. To address the Sahel regions illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, he called for a multidimensional response, including tackling the root causes. Algeria contributed to the African Unions efforts by hosting two key institutions on terrorism and transnational organized crimes. Nuclear-weapon-free zones were not only confidence-building measures, but also steps towards the complete elimination of those weapons. Voicing continued support for the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (Pelindaba Treaty), he called for the establishment of such a zone in the Middle East as it remained a legitimate demand and a priority to peace. His countrys Mediterranean policy was based on cooperation, good neighbourliness and mutual respect. In that vein, he introduced Algerias draft resolution on strengthening security and cooperation in the Mediterranean region and counted on co-sponsorship, support and adoption by consensus (document A/77/C.1/L.24).\n\nMs. OSOBA ( United Kingdom ) stated that regional stability, based upon a mutual understanding and respect of neighbours responsibilities towards each other, was essential for global peace. In Europe, the Russian Federation was conducting an unprovoked, premeditated and barbaric attack against Ukraine. The Federations disinformation about Ukraine and its partners, with unfounded allegations around chemical and biological weapons, was deplorable. In the Middle East, regional stability was worsened by Irans behavior. Iran took unprecedented steps to accelerate the pace of its nuclear programme, producing enriched uranium, including highly enriched uranium, at an alarming pace. Further, the Assad regimes responsibility had been recognized for eight chemical weapons attacks, with further attacks under investigation. The United Kingdom had attended the 2019 and 2021 Conferences on the Middle East weapons-of-mass-destruction-free zone as an observer and had voiced its reservations about the credibility of a process that did not include all States of the region. In Asia, the United Kingdom was concerned with the continued development of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas illicit nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes. Sanctions targeting that countrys illicit programmes should be strictly enforced by the international community. The United Kingdom also remained concerned about the potential for a misunderstanding between India and Pakistan.\n\nAHMED ABDULMUNEM AHMED AHMED ( Iraq ) reiterated his support for the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in general and the elimination of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. The 1995 resolution on the Middle East represented a vital pillar of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and a crucial step towards the creation of such a zone in the Middle East. He called on all concerned to fulfil their responsibilities and obligations regarding the creation of a Middle East zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. The region was not presently free of nuclear weapons because it was not possible to inspect Israeli nuclear installations or their military capabilities.\n\nAZRIL BIN ABD AZIZ ( Malaysia ), associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and ASEAN, said nuclear-weapon-free zones played a vital role in preventing any threat or use of odious tools of war and destruction. Both at the NPT Review Conference and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Meeting of States Parties, nuclear-weapon-free zones were underlined as critical elements in the collective endeavour to free the world from the long shadow cast by the continued possession of nuclear arsenals by a select few. The need for such zones was further highlighted by the NPT Review Conferences consecutive failures, particularly amid renewed geopolitical tensions and nuclear rhetoric. The full promise of the Bangkok Treaty could not be realized until nuclear-weapon States ratified the Protocol. The absence of legally binding negative security assurances did not augur well for regional peace and security. He called for intensified efforts as a quarter-century was precious time lost and progress could not be deferred indefinitely. Malaysia supported a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and welcomed recent efforts in that regard. Regional disarmament required continued attention, and efforts must be redoubled.\n\nMr. HAMED ( Niger ), associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group, said his country faced criminal terrorist groups that spread death and destruction across the Sahel region. Small arms and light weapons and improvised explosive devices by non-State armed groups caused 1,500 victims per year in the region half the worlds total. Proliferation of those weapons was a key issue and he supported multilateral efforts to combat it, including control of trafficking, surveillance, tracing and marking. Besides acceding to almost all conventional weapons instruments, Niger was also a Pelindaba Treaty signatory State. Raising awareness, spreading information on the negative impacts of small arms and light weapons possession and capacity-building was important. On that front, Nigers actions had allowed it to recover a significant number of arms and munitions, including anti-personnel landmines. Given the threat of small arms and light weapons to the region, he reiterated his support for all multilateral disarmament initiatives and hoped for considerable progress during this session.\n\nRADHA DAY, Chief, Regional Disarmament, Information and Outreach Branch, United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, speaking on behalf of the Directors of the United Nations Regional Centres for Peace and Disarmament, provided an overview of the work of the Centres in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The Centres worked hand in hand with States, regional organizations and others to address security challenges. Inclusivity and enhancing the role of women and youth in disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control policymaking were key to sustainably addressing the challenges. The critical role of disarmament education in delivering authoritative skills and knowledge to diverse audiences in order to advance effective policy making could not be underestimated.\n\nShe said that the Centres had supported Member States in combating the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and strengthening national implementation of multilateral non-proliferation treaties, through legal assistance, technical support and improved regional dialogue. The war in Ukraine had spotlighted the Vienna-based international organizations and intergovernmental processes. The Vienna Office was coordinating efforts such as the development of substantive content, functionalities and usership of the Office for Disarmament Affairs e-learning platform and the Disarmament Education Dashboard, which was a globally accessible, free resource.\n\nThe Centres, however, faced challenges, she said, citing insufficient or unpredictable funding, which constrained the sustainability of its engagement. The siloed approaches to disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation restricted the ability to develop more comprehensive programmes, which were required to tackle a broader range of underpinning drivers. She stressed that the Centres activities should be shaped by national and regional ownership. Greater efforts should be made to translate global disarmament commitments into regional and national actions, aimed at making a tangible difference in peoples lives. Disarmament education remained vital yet severely underresourced. That called for increased and sustained investment, for the office in Vienna, for the activities of the Regional Centres and for disarmament education globally.\n\nINDIRA ARYAL ( Nepal ), associating with the Non-Aligned Movement, said regional disarmament approaches strengthened global efforts and should be pursued simultaneously. Nepal supported nuclear-weapon-free zones and underscored the importance of regional diplomacy and dialogue to foster confidence and trust and reduce military spending. Disarmament initiatives were successful when trust and confidence were cultivated through effective partnerships among Governments, experts and civil society. The wider participation of women and youth was essential as they were forces for change and progress. Moreover, disarmament education enhanced awareness of the humanitarian consequences of weapons. United Nations Regional Centres provided permanent platforms for Member States for constant dialogue, exchanges of views and best practices. As a host country, Nepal supported the Regional Centres capacity-building and awareness-raising efforts to universalize and implement multilateral disarmament instruments. She encouraged regional Member States to collaborate and make voluntary contributions. Nepal tabled the resolution on United Nations Regional Centres for Peace and Disarmament in the Pacific and hoped for its adoption by consensus (document A/77/C.1/L.37).\n\nILGAR GURBANOV ( Armenia ) expressed its strong concerns regarding the systemic conventional arms control regime violations of Azerbaijan, in particular, heavyweapon accumulation and armed forces outside verification regimes. Azerbaijans actions had led to a deterioration of peace and security in the South Caucasus. The international communitys lack of a strong reaction allowed Azerbaijani military build-up and created a fertile ground for it to pursue a policy of use of force against Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. Azerbaijans disregard for its obligations culminated in the premeditated large-scale aggression amid the pandemic, where it used all types of heavy weaponry, targeting civilian populations and infrastructures and committing war crimes and atrocities. In the conflicts aftermath, the situation remained fragile. Since 13 September, Azerbaijans military aggression caused 200 civilian deaths, with daily military provocations and ceasefire violations. Armenia attached high importance to international and region organizations activities to conduct monitoring and factfinding missions to prevent acts of aggression as a means of conflict resolution.\n\nZHANGELDY SYRYMBET ( Kazakhstan ) said that failure to achieve regional disarmament and security goals could derail efforts to sustain world peace and security. Political and diplomatic solutions were the only effective tools for dealing with intricate interlocking international threats. To expand regional cooperation and achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Kazakhstan proposed an Almaty United Nations Hub in Central Asia and Afghanistan. He called for settling the deep rift on the Korean Peninsula and preserving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. He supported a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East as those were among the most effective means to prevent proliferation. United Nations Regional Centres provided valuable contributions towards regional and global disarmament, and he welcomed Member States financial and political contributions. The United Nations disarmament fellowship trained future young advocates on freeing the world of nuclear weapons and inspired them to become part of the collective multilateral action for disarmament and security.\n\nROSANIS ROMERO LPEZ ( Cuba ) said that regional and subregional initiatives for disarmament and arms control contributed to achieving a safer world. His region had been the first densely populated area of the world to have declared itself a nuclear-weapon-free zone through the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco). All Latin American and Caribbean countries were party to the NPT and Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). It was also the region with the largest number of States parties and signatories to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The United States remained be the greatest threat to the stability and cooperation between countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Its irresponsible actions also affected security in other parts of the world. Nuclear-weapon-free zones contributed to nuclear disarmament. They strengthened the non-proliferation regime and fostered the maintenance of international peace and security, including on a regional basis.\n\nWAJDI HASSAN M. MOHARRAM ( Saudi Arabia ), associating with the Arab Group, reaffirmed the importance of the non-proliferation regime for the maintenance of international peace and security. Israels continued refusal to accede to the NPT challenged the Treatys credibility and universality. It also threatened the efforts of the international community to the strengthen the non-proliferation regime. The Treaty was the only guarantee against the misuse of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Saudi Arabia was also gravely concerned over the continued non-compliance by Iran with its nuclear undertakings, particularly in view of IAEA reports. Saudi Arabia supported all international efforts aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nKONSTANTINOS CHRISTOGLOU ( Greece ), associating with the European Union, actively supported regional disarmament cooperation as an effective step to fulfilling global disarmament. He pointed to the important work of the United Nations Regional Centres for Peace and Disarmament. Conventional arms diversion and their illicit trade, particularly in small arms and light weapons, underlined the importance of regional and international prevention and control initiatives. In the face of the Middle Easts challenges, Greece steadily sought to consolidate regional security frameworks, primarily through dialogue and cooperation. Greeces network of regional tripartite and multilateral cooperation mechanisms saw ever-increasing momentum. Dynamic synergies had been created in various sectors, such as digital technology, cybersecurity, innovation, energy, water, resource management, the environment and more. He looked forward to working with other countries that shared common principles and values. In that vein, Greece supported the draft resolution on strengthening security and cooperation in the Mediterranean region, as well as other texts on regional security.\n\nSULTAN NATHEIR MUSTAFA ALQAISI ( Jordan ), associating with the Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement, expressed grave concern at the failure to achieve tangible progress in the field of disarmament and the lack of implementation of the agreed commitments. In order to contribute to efforts that aimed to rid the Middle East from weapons of mass destruction, Jordan supported the Conference on establishing a Middle East zone free of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons. He reiterated Jordans call on Israel to join the Conference without any preconditions and urged its accession to the NPT. Israel must place all its nuclear facilities and activities under the IAEA comprehensive safeguards regime, he added.\n\nFLAVIO DAMICO ( Brazil ) said that the Latin American and Caribbean region was at the forefront of implementing the concept of nuclear-weapon-free zones. By accepting \"a miniscule decrease\" in security levels by doing away with conditionalities, nuclear-weapon States could provide a huge boost to the security of States in the region. In the last 30 years, Brazil alongside Argentina had developed an agency for the accounting and control of nuclear materials. The agency, along with IAEA, ensured the physical monitoring of nuclear activities under the NPTs article IV based on the principle of \"neighbours watching neighbours\". Brazil hoped that that success story would serve as a \"source of inspiration\" and example of good practices in the field of non-proliferation.\n\nRight of Reply\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation rejected all accusations against his country as unfounded. He recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the basis of the free will of the South Ossetian and Abkhaz peoples. The attack of Saakashvili's regime against South Ossetia in August 2008 and the preparation of a similar action against Abkhazia, the culmination of many years of violent policy of Tbilisi against those small nations, left them no choice but to ensure their security and the right to exist through self-determination as independent States. Of the most serious concern was the alarming information coming from reliable sources that the Kyiv regime was preparing a provocation using an explosive device filled with radioactive substances, the so-called \"dirty bomb\". Its purpose was obvious to accuse the Russian Federation of using weapons of mass destruction. According to information available to Moscow, the Kyiv regime planned to detonate such a bomb by disguising it as an abnormal actuation of a Russian low-yield nuclear weapon that used highly enriched uranium as a charge. Kyiv's recent statements about the need for \"preventive nuclear strikes\" by NATO countries against the Russian Federation were totally unacceptable. The representative demanded that the Kyiv authorities and their Western handlers stopped taking actions that brought the world to a nuclear catastrophe and threatened the lives of innocent civilians.\n\nThe representative of China said that the United States delegate spoke nonsense about China's Taiwan question and China's nuclear policy, making groundless accusations against China. The United Nations General Assembly at its twentysixth session adopted resolution 2758 by an overwhelming majority. It explicitly restored all its rights to the People's Republic of China and recognized the representatives of the Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations. The United States was once again manipulating the Taiwan question, on the General Assembly platform, which would surely be met with rejection and opposition by the international community. The question of Taiwan was purely China's internal affair. China firmly opposed the United States manipulation of Taiwan-related issues and its words and actions to provoke confrontation in the region. Taiwan belonged to China. It was up to the Chinese people to resolve the Taiwan issue. Time and again, the United States made an issue out of China's military development and arms control policies. It clung to a cold war mentality and was obsessed with great Powers competition, attempting to use China as its adversary to serve its global and regional security strategy with regard to China's nuclear policy. The limited nuclear deterrence developed by China aimed solely at deterring countries and acts that attempted to use nuclear weapons against China. That policy was open, above board and transparent. A country that did not threaten China with its nuclear weapons would not be met with the deterrence of China's nuclear capability.\n\nThe representative of Israel , in right of reply, said speakers had claimed a comprehensive security architecture could be achieved without recognizing Israels right to exist and without building the necessary trust among regional States. That position was untenable. Experiences from other regions showed that the zones could only be the outcome of all Parties mutual political desire, while taking into account each countrys security concerns, as stipulated in the 1999 Disarmament Commission Report on guidelines on nuclear-weapon-free zones. Anything but that could not serve as a useful base for discourse on the establishment of a Middle East nuclear-weapon-free zone. Ill-motivated initiatives, such as the United Nations Conference on such a zone, went against guidelines and against established principles of nuclear-weapon-free zones and were unhelpful. Israel would not participate in \"artificial processes\" that bypassed the established practices.\n\nIran was the biggest threat to the region and beyond, he said. It shamelessly proliferated arms of all kinds, supported and trained proxy organizations to spread terror and engaged in hostilities. Iran perpetuated all that in the name of spreading its dominance and its extremist ideologies.\n\nThe representative of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea , in right of reply, categorically rejected the \"absurd\" rhetoric by the United States as an effort to conceal its identity as the main culprit for the escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The root cause of the destabilizing situation on the Korean Peninsula was the United States hostile policy, its aggressive joint military drills and its uninterrupted introduction of nuclear assets on the Korean Peninsula. The risk of conflict ran higher every time it conducted joint military exercises with the mobilization of nuclear assets.\n\nThe United States, he said, was hell-bent on spreading misinformation, aimed at demonizing the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas Government, by stating that the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas enhanced defensive capabilities posed a serious threat to global peace and regional security. The United States ulterior motive was to one day overthrow his Government and to pressure it to law down its nuclear weapons and degrade its capabilities. In the past, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea had tabled numerous proposals for confidence-building and disarmament to defuse the security crisis on the Korean Peninsula. However, the United States responded with a vicious hostile policy, nuclear threats and blackmail, by conducting joint military exercises and introducing strategic assets and military hardware to the Republic of Korea.\n\nHe said that the United States diplomatic engagement was nothing but hypocrisy to conceal its aggressive nature and evade responsibility. War games were not compatible with dialogue. As the hostile policy and nuclear blackmail of the United States increased, The Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas strength was bound to grow proportionally. The United States had compelled his country to adopt a law on the policy of nuclear forces. It should be reminded that its heinous hostile policy brought about todays reality and it should ask itself how far it would drive the current situation in the future.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Australias remarks constituted grave political provocations, he said. It was ridiculous that they were acting as if they were the judge of disarmament but were in fact undermining the global non-proliferation regime through the \"AUKUS\" partnership with the United States. Those countries were shamefully following the United States hostile policy against his country. The United Kingdoms nuclear weapons policy included increasing its stockpile, lowering the threshold for use, and reducing transparency. The United Kingdom and Australia were advised to \"look in the mirror and clean their smeared faces\" before pointing accusing fingers at others. The Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas efforts for an enhanced war deterrence force was aimed at safeguarding national security and development. Nobody could dispute such a much-warranted exercise of the right to self-defence.\n\nThe representative of the European Union , in right of reply, regretted taking the floor on behalf of the European Union and its Member States in response to the statement by the Russian Federation referring to so-called referenda on Ukrainian territory. The European Union firmly rejected and unequivocally condemned the illegal annexation by the Russian Federation, which followed the sham so-called referendum, which had nothing to do with free expression of will. Widespread and systematic abuses of human rights and intimidation of Ukrainian citizens had been reported, including by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, which submitted its report to the General Assembly several days ago about the Russian atrocities, including arbitrary executions and detentions, torture and other ill-treatment, such as sexual and gender-based violence.\n\nThe representative of Azerbaijan , in right of reply, was compelled to answer to Armenias evident attempt to accuse Azerbaijan of war crimes. It was paradoxical that Armenia would unleash aggression against others. It had carried out ethnic cleansing on a massive scale and committed other crimes during the war and was now talking about territorial claims. Over the years, Armenia had provided inaccurate and incomplete information on its armed forces in the annual exchange of military information, including in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms. In contrast to Armenia's assertion in regard to imaginary aggression, it had been Azerbaijan, which, after the end of the conflict, had initiated the process of normalizing relations based on mutual recognition and respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders, and pushed for concrete results on three specific tracks.\n\nWhatever Armenia claimed, the speaker said, it refused to withdraw the remnants of its armed forces while projecting itself as a proponent of human rights and democracy. Armenia continued without hesitation to deny its responsibility for numerous war crimes committed by its forces, agents and officials, and it refused to prosecute and punish the perpetrators. Instead of attempting to distort the reality, mislead the international community and misinterpret international documents, Armenia should, first and foremost, abandon hostile narratives, cease disseminating propaganda and prosecute and punish those responsible for the numerous war crimes. It should also commit to normalizing relations based on international law, comply faithfully with international obligations and support the efforts aiming at building, strengthening and sustaining peace and stability in the region.\n\nThe representative of Syria , in right of rely, clarified its cooperation with the IAEA. He rejected the United States statement on Syrias lack of cooperation. That was a politicized and politically-driven statement based on hostilities against Syria. Syria had been among the first to join the IAEA and the NPT in 1968, when the Treaty was adopted. His country also continued to be among the first countries to work diligently on the regional and international level to establish a zone in the Middle East free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. It had also implemented the IAEAs Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, and international inspectors conducted visits annually. Syria provided them with all they needed in accordance with the Agreement.\n\nThe speaker said that those protecting Israel, allowing it to keep its nuclear weapons, providing it with the latest technology and encouraging it to retain their nuclear facilities outside comprehensive safeguards and any kind of international oversight, could not be taken seriously when speaking about efforts towards peace and security in the Middle East and the NPT architecture.\n\nHe condemned the inappropriate language used by the representative of the United Kingdom to refer to his countrys name. It was inappropriate language in this forum. The speaker could use similar non-diplomatic terms, but he was keen to ensuring a constructive environment, and that prevented him from doing so. In addition, he strongly condemned all the United Kingdoms lies and baseless accusations regarding Syrias cooperation with the Chemical Weapons Convention. Syria had eliminated its chemical weapons stockpile. The legitimacy of the investigative team was in question, as its establishment was part of a plan targeting Syria. Those who prepared the report ignored Syrias full cooperation with IAEA and accused it of non-compliance. It was a politicized decision that would not serve the universality of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Political agendas were being advanced, as evidenced by the mechanisms for decision-making that led to divisions and polarizations, and ignored the tradition of consensus-based decision-making.\n\nBritish colonialism created a lot of destruction in his region, he said. The United Kingdom sponsored terrorists in his country, provided them with all means of assistance, weapons, ammunitions, intelligence and media coverage. British intelligence established the \"White Helmets\" organization that the United Nations had designated as a terrorist group, to serve its hostile policies against Syria. They fabricated the use of chemical weapons, accused the Syrian Arab Army of using those weapons and, with that, carried out attacks on Syria.\n\nThe representative of the Republic of Korea , in right of reply, said that the allegations by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea had been refuted numerous times by various delegations. Its representative had mentioned the joint military exercise started in 1954. That was one year after the armistice, because the Republic of Korea had suffered a war of aggression started by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. That was the root cause.\n\nVarious Security Council resolutions, he noted, stated that that the armed attack on the Republic of Korea by armed forces of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea constituted a breach to peace. This year, the world had witnessed more than 40 ballistic missile launches by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, which was now preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test. Its recently adopted nuclear forces law lowered the threshold for nuclear weapon use and demonstrated its hostile intensions. A threat in actions and words.\n\nHe said that combined defence and deterrence posture and the joint exercises were a response to those military threats. Among the incidents listed by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea was the unfortunate 1968 attempt by that country to assassinate the President of the Republic of Korea with its special forces. If that country intended to fulfil its stated responsibilities to build a prosperous and peaceful world, it must start with abiding by all Security Council resolutions and abandon all nuclear weapons and programmes in a complete, irreversible and verifiable manner. Its programmes were unlawful and were the main culprit undermining sustained peace on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. According to the Charters Article 25, all United Nations Member States agreed to accept and carry out Security Council decisions. The delegation of the Republic of Korea urged the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to stop provocations and return to denuclearization talks, adding that doors for dialogue remained open.\n\nThe representative of Iran , in right of reply, categorically rejected the unfounded accusations against his country, underlining that the dissemination of fake news against regional actors, including through the pursuit of widespread and systematic disinformation and phobic campaigns, had long been a standard practice of the Israeli regime. No amount of smear campaigns against others could detract from the brutalities, crimes and lawlessness of the Israeli regime. Those included, but were not limited to, the waging of more than 15 of the wars in the region, the commission of aggression against all of its neighbours without exception, the invasion of other countries in the region and beyond, the continuation of its unlawful occupation of Palestine and parts of Syria and Lebanon, the imposition of an inhumane blockade on the Gaza Strip for over a decade, the unlawful construction and expansion of settlements, the construction of an illegal separation wall, the assassination of several Iranian nuclear scientists and the conduct of many other sabotage, subversive, divisive and destabilizing activities with far-reaching implications for international peace and security. A brief look at the Israeli regime's practices in the area of armaments indicated their destructive and destabilizing nature, which included the massive accumulation of the most sophisticated conventional weapons, the development of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass instruction, as well as clandestine nuclear activities in unsafeguarded nuclear facilities.\n\nHe said that the Israeli regime also refused to join international legally binding instruments banning weapons of mass instruction, while hampering all international efforts aimed at establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, as proposed by Iran in 1974. The fact that the Israeli regime admitted that it would continue to destroy Iranian capabilities proved, without a doubt, that it had been responsible for the terrorist attacks against Iranian peaceful nuclear programme in the past. The Israeli regime should be held accountable for the consequences of its unlawful measures.\n\nThe speaker implored the Government of the United Kingdom to uphold its legal responsibilities in relation to nuclear disarmament under the NPTs Article VI. The indisputable fact was that that country was in flagrant non-compliance, not just by disobeying that responsibility, but also by strengthening its nuclear arsenal and participating in nuclear sharing with the United States. That and more seriously complicated its non-proliferation obligations. The United Kingdom had fallen short of living up to its JCPOA obligations when it came to Iran's peaceful nuclear programme.\n\nContrary to the claims by Saudi Arabia, Iran was upholding its commitments, said the speaker, adding that Iran looked forward to Saudi Arabia fully meeting the long-time requests of the IAEA to ensure a safeguarded nuclear programme.\n\nThe representative of the United States , in right of reply, said that given the small amount of time allotted, he would not respond to the statements against his country by China and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, or even by Syria and Iran, primarily because they recapitulated well-known positions. He would respond, however, to the Russian Federation because of the implied threat to take specific action. That was a very serious charge that somehow the Ukrainians with the assistance of Americans and others were preparing a \"dirty bomb\" to widen the war even further. The United States Government was concerned enough about the threat that high-level officials had reached out to their Russian counterparts to talk to them about that. It struck the United States as disinformation to create a potential pretext for the Russian Federation to use a tactical weapon. He urged the Russian Federation to refrain from those kinds of implicit threats.\n\nThe representative of Armenia , in right of reply, deplored Azerbaijans attempts to justify heinous crimes and violations of arms control regimes and norms by presenting sovereignty claims. Moreover, this Committee discussed international security issues and not the legal status of territories. That was dangerous behaviour, he said, pointing to the history of such claims, voiced in the past by aggressors and perpetrators of crimes.\n\nSimilarly, he said, throughout the years, Azerbaijan had tried to justify its non-compliance with conventional arms regimes, under the pretext of ending the conflict, and had rejected all proposals by mediators aimed at establishing confidence-building and security mechanisms. It used that pretext to continue its massive military build-up and its policy of military aggression. Reacting to the point of inciting hatred, he recalled the finding by the United Nations Committee on the elimination of racial discriminations concern about the grave human rights violations committed during the 2020 hostilities by Azerbaijani military forces against persons of Armenian origin. Moreover, the speaker expressed concern about the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, like churches, and about incitement of racial hatred and propagation of racial stereotypes against people of Armenian nationality or ethnic origin by public figures and government officials.\n\nThe massive amount of evidence pointing to Azerbaijani criminal conduct by its military was undeniable, he said. Moreover, it was massively celebrated in that country. It was ever more imperative that all acts of atrocities were fully investigated and that the perpetrators were brought to justice.\n\nLastly, Azerbaijan did not speak about its peaceful intentions, he said. While peace talks were under way, threats of use of force were constantly voiced and actual force was used on the ground. Aggression was carried out by one negotiating country against the other. Azerbaijans most recent attack only demonstrated that, in the absence of proper accountability measures, policies of aggression would likely continue and increase. That must be stopped.\n\nThe representative of Saudi Arabia , in right of reply, responded to the comments made by Iran. The \"Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\" had signed and ratified the Safeguard Agreement with the IAEA in 2009. As known to everyone, that agreement applied to countries without nuclear or enrichment activities. Saudi Arabia was resolutely committed to meeting its international obligations, and it called on Iran to follow suit.\n\nThe representative of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea , stated that the Korean War had been instigated by the United States in order to realize its \"wild ambition\" to rule over the whole Korean Peninsula and to seek dominance over the whole world. History could not be denied. The aggressive nature of the United States had not changed in the least. It was somewhat erratic for \"South Korea\" to interfere out of nowhere to speak for the United States. It was prophetic that \"South Korea\" should heavily depend on the United States for its own security and import advanced military hardware from the United States. The current \"South Korean\" conservative force was resorting to an extremely ferocious, confrontational policy against the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, thus driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war. The current southern Korean conservative force designated the Government and army of his country as the archnemesis and was resorting to all sorts of evil and inappropriate acts. \"South Korea\" was frantically involved in dangerous military actions and modernization of armaments as well as increased response capability through the establishment of the so-called \"Three-Axis\" defence system strategic command and was now conducting joint military exercises with the United States. His country would closely watch \"South Koreas\" dangerous military actions and respond more strongly to any military provocation.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation was compelled once more to take the floor in order to respond to some baseless accusations again made by the delegations of the European Union and the United States. The special military operation in Ukraine was being carried out by the Russian Federation in full compliance with its international commitments, including those foreseen in international law. Regarding the referendums, the representative said there were provocations by the Kyiv regime, which carried out massive artillery attacks on the people and on civilian targets. Despite that, the people were not intimidated from going to the polls and expressing their will. They made a conscious choice in favour of \"Russia\", and they had the opportunity to independently and freely express their opinion. That was confirmed by many observers who were present and expressed that the referendums were carried out in full compliance with the principle of equality of self-determination of peoples enshrined in the Charter.\n\nAs for the situation with the \"dirty bomb\", he stated that the delegation of the United States was merely confirming what had been said about the fact that a scenario would unfold in which there was a provocation by the Kyiv regime. He wanted the international community to see what was going on and asked the Kyiv authorities and the Western parties to control them to stop undertaking acts which would lead the world to the brink of a nuclear disaster and imperil the lives of completely innocent civilians. It was enough \"rocking of the nuclear boat\".\n\nThe representative of Azerbaijan , in right of reply, refuted the distortion by the Armenian delegation. The insinuations raised the question about whether the delegation knew the function of the First Committee. The answer to that question was negative. Instead of repeating a narrative, Armenia should understand once and for all that respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity was absolutely imperative for regional security. The goal of a peaceful region could not be achieved by disrespecting international law, resorting to provocations and endlessly repeating outdated narratives.\n\nHe said that immediately after the November 2020 conflicts end, Azerbaijan had initiated a project to normalize State relations in order to contribute to broader regional peace. The moment the conflict was resolved, Azerbaijan repeated its efforts to start negotiations on a peace agreement, based on mutual recognition of sovereignty and territorial integrity. In the current post-conflict stage, the absolute priority for Azerbaijan was long-term sustainable peace. At the present critical juncture, all efforts should be geared towards making irreversible peace and signing the peace treaty based on Azerbaijans fivepoint proposal. There was no alternative to peace. He demanded that Armenia cease its artificial delays and pointless excuses, which testified its non-constructive attitude towards its obligations.\n\nThe representative of Armenia , in right of reply, said that Azerbaijans unapologetic use of force undermined arms control regimes in the region. Azerbaijan had made its continued aggression to acquire territories a \"new normal\" for the region. Azerbaijan was the threat to regional peace and security and should be condemned and stopped. The international communitys response was vital to reverse the spiral of violence in the region. Azerbaijan should retreat from the sovereign territories of Armenia, release prisoners of war, clarify information on victims of forced disappearances and observe the ceasefire.\n\nOuter Space (Disarmament Aspects of)\n\nGRATA ENDAH WERDANINGTYAS ( Indonesia ) speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, said that prevention of an arms race in outer space, including a ban to deploy or use weapons therein, would avert a grave danger for international peace and security. She rejected the declaration by the United States in 2018 that \"space is a warfighting domain\" or \"the next battlefield\", and accordingly, restated the urgent need for the start of substantive work in the Conference on Disarmament on preventing an outer space arms race.\n\nShe remained concerned over the negative implications of development and deployment of anti-ballistic-missile defence systems and the threat of the weaponization of outer space, which had contributed to further erosion of an international climate conducive to strengthening of international security. The abrogation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty brought new challenges to international peace and stability, and to preventing an outer space arms race. The negative security consequences of deployment of strategic missile defence systems could trigger an arms race and lead to further development of advanced missile systems, as well as increase the number of nuclear weapons. While voluntary transparency and confidence-building measures might partially contribute to reducing mistrust and enhancing the safety of outer space operations in the short-term, they were no substitute for the early conclusion of a legally binding instrument.\n\nMUHAMMAD ZAYYANU BANDIYA ( Nigeria ), speaking on behalf of the African Group and associating with the Non-Aligned Movement, said outer space and celestial bodies must be safeguarded as the common heritage of humankind. They could only be used, explored, and utilized for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all Member States, irrespective of their social, economic or scientific development. An arms race in outer space should be prevented through a legally binding instrument, complementing the international legal framework. The planet, including outer space, should be free of nuclear weapons, as their presence was an existential threat to global peace and humanitys future survival.\n\nHe said that substantive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament must begin on legally binding and multilaterally verifiable instruments to prevent an arms race in outer space. The African Group called on the United Nations to promote equal and non-discriminatory access to outer space for all nations. Intentionally created space debris arising from deliberate destruction of space systems were of major concern, owing to the consequences on the future exploration and use of outer space. Its mitigation and the prohibition of their intentional creation should be among the priorities at the United Nations.\n\nSYED MOHAMAD HASRIN AIDID ( Malaysia ), speaking on behalf of the ASEAN, said the world had witnessed much change since the dawn of the space age some six decades ago. In that regard, all activities must be conducted in accordance with international law and the principle of non-appropriation of outer space. It was incumbent on all States to ensure that the use and exploration of outer space remained peaceful. The General Assembly must play a vital role in fostering continued dialogue on current issues and challenges in that field. ASEAN reaffirmed the need for a universal, comprehensive and non-discriminatory multilateral approach towards the issue of missiles, negotiated multilaterally within the United Nations. Any initiatives on the subject should take into account the security concerns of all States and the inherent right to peaceful use of space technology. He reiterated ASEANs call on all Member States, in particular those with major space capabilities, to contribute to the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space as an essential condition for the promotion of international cooperation.\n\nMr. MOHAMMED AL-TAIE ( Iraq ), speaking on behalf of the Arab Group and associating with the Non-Aligned Movement, underscored the importance of the use of outer space for peaceful purposes only. All forms of armaments in that domain must be prohibited. The current agreements should keep pace with developments and declarations, including those made by States on launching armed attacks on assets in outer space. Outer space was a common heritage of humankind, and all activities there needed to be regulated under United Nations auspices. He called for a legally binding instrument to prevent an outer space arms race.\n\nAny endeavors to regulate outer space, he said, must keep in mind all States interests and not obstruct the inherent right to the realms peaceful use. Outer space should be free of conflict, and legally binding instruments should cover the prohibition of weapon placements, attacks on bodies in outer space and weapon testing. International cooperation should be promoted. Increased tension on the international level and increased dependency on outer space for reasons of strategic importance, increased risks. In that vein, the Arab Group welcomed the Open-Ended Working Groups pursuit of limiting space threats through principles, rules and norms on responsible conduct.\n\nMr. VORONTSOV ( Russian Federation ) speaking on behalf of a group of like-minded countries on the topic, said that the suggestion to undertake a political commitment not to conduct destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile tests was a step in the right direction. At the same time, it was an insufficient guarantee of the exclusively peaceful use of outer space and did not fully address the task of preventing an arms race there. The initiative related to that type of missile test contained several significant omissions. The adoption of such commitment did not imply the renouncement of developing and manufacturing the anti-satellite systems, their combat use or non-destructive anti-satellite missile tests. Nor was the elimination of the already available weapons of that type envisaged. As a result, if that initiative became universal, it would benefit a certain group of States that were already in possession of such means, while others, primarily the developing countries, would find themselves in a discriminated position. All that was exacerbated by the absence of a definition of anti-satellite missile weapons and their testing, as well as of a verification mechanism related to that political commitment.\n\nMr. KARCZMARZ, representative of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, stated that many of the systems and services that were today essential for well-being and security depended directly or indirectly on space. Agreeing on norms of responsible behaviors was a first step to maintaining space security. The space environment was becoming increasingly congested, contested and competitive. The destruction of space objects or interruptions of their services posed threats and risks to connected societies increasingly dependent on those services. Furthermore, the dual-use nature of many space objects and systems posed challenges when it came to protecting space assets and identifying threats, distinguishing between innocuous behaviours and potentially threatening ones.\n\nHe was concerned about the development, testing and potential proliferation of anti-satellite weapons. Among the most imminent threats were destructive directascent anti-satellite tests, whose most harmful effects could be the destruction of the targeted satellite, as well as the collateral generation of multiple space debris. The Union strongly condemned the Russian Federations conduct of a kinetic direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon test against its own satellite, COSMOS 1408, as a clear act of irresponsible behaviour in outer space. It generated a large amount of space debris that constituted a recurring risk for crewed and uncrewed space activities, including at the International Space Station. The conduct of such tests was dangerous and highly destabilizing, and could potentially lead to deteriorating the confidence between space actors, thereby increasing the perception of threats.\n\nMs. CASSELS ( Canada ) said that space was an integral part of daily life, enabling navigations, cell phone service, financial transactions and more. The viability of space operations was increasingly vulnerable to both natural and man-made threats, yet outer space lacked an international norms regime. General Assembly resolution 75/36 and the Open-Ended Working Group on space threat were welcome steps towards a new approach to space security, especially given the long-standing deadlock in the Conference on Disarmament. To prevent an arms race in outer space, it was time for a pragmatic approach that included objective descriptions of responsible conduct, for which she cited as a promising example the United States commitment to refrain from direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing. Eliminating such tests reduced tensions in space and preventing debriscreation, which threatened all personnel and spacecraft in operation. Pragmatic broadly adopted norms would become legally binding international law in the future and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, miscalculations and hostilities surrounding space.\n\nMr. PARNOHADININGRAT ( Indonesia ), associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and ASEAN, noted the increased threat of weaponization and militarization of outer space, and said that preventing and outer space arms race assumed even greater urgency. He recognized the significance of existing international regimes on outer space, including the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, but said they were inadequate to deter militarization and weaponization. He reiterated the call for the immediate negotiation and conclusion of a legally binding international instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space in all its aspects. The conclusion of that instrument should contribute to preventing the increasing risks and threats. Greater transparency and confidence-building measures, including data-sharing and accurate information on outer space activities, could lessen misunderstandings and prevent conflicts. However, those had limitations, particularly because they were not legally binding.\n\nMs. PETIT ( France ) said her country was committed to the preservation of a safe space environment, as well as to respect for the full applicability of international law to space activities, such as freedom of access and its peaceful use. France remained firmly committed to the prevention of an arms race in space. The benefits derived from space applications could be threatened by risks of incidents, deliberate or even hostile acts, which could exacerbate the proliferation of space debris and threaten the safety, stability, security and sustainability of the use of space. The draft treaty on the prevention of the first deployment of weapons in outer space tabled in the Conference on Disarmament, as well as the related resolutions presented in the First Committee had many deficiencies. They did not define what a weapon in outer space was, nor did they address the challenge of verification. Those, therefore, could increase mistrust and the risk of misunderstandings about States activities and intentions.\n\nMoreover, she continued, with the majority of space assets being dualuse, the distinction between military and civilian, threatening and non-threatening capabilities, and ultimately the choice to prohibit some over others, was an uneasy one and would inevitably impact the technological and economic development of all nations, especially emerging space-faring nations. She added that the Treaty on the Prevention of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat of Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects and related initiatives did not address all threats, including those from the ground into space, such as the ones generated by destructive anti-satellite tests fired from the ground.\n\nABDELRHMAN MOHAMED FARID HEGAZY ( Egypt ), associating with the Arab Group, Non-Aligned Movement, and the African Group, said outer space was the shared heritage of all people equally throughout the world. Considering the extreme volatility of the outer space environment, it must not become a scene of military conflict. Besides confidence-building as interim steps, there was a clear need for legally binding measures to fill existing legal gaps. Their scope should include the prohibition of weapons placement, threat or use of force against satellites or other assets, intentionally harming, interfering or interrupting the functioning of outer space assets, and developing, testing or stockpiling weapons there. Those legally binding instruments could be complemented by a set of tools on transparency, dispute-settlement and consultation mechanisms. The Governmental Group of Experts saw substantial progress, he said, noting appreciation for the Open-Ended Working Group on space threats. In that regard, Sri Lanka and Egypt tabled a draft resolution on preventing an outer space arms race, for which he welcomed consensus adoption (document A/77/C.1/L.3).\n\nMs. MCINTYRE ( Australia ) said that the definitional challenges of a weapon, particularly in relation to dual-use space objects, and rapidly developing new technology, had yet to be adequately addressed. The technical challenge of verifying the attributes of any object in space to assess if it was a weapon or not was significant. She reiterated Australias stance that responsible behaviours, actions or activities were ones that were clearly communicated and avoided surprises, respected the safety and security of other actors and beneficiaries, and contributed to stability and risk reduction. Earlier this year, the United States had made a commitment to refrain from destructive, directascent anti-satellite missile testing. Such testing was irresponsible, could generate large amounts of debris and could be viewed as threatening behaviour. Australia would join the United States and a growing number of other States by committing not to conduct such testing. She called for all States to join the initiative and seize the practice.\n\nRight of Reply\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation , in right of reply, said he wished to respond to the \"baseless accusations\" made by the delegation of the European Union in connection with outer space activities carried out by the Russian Federation. He wished to provide explanations with regard to what had been carried out on the 15th of November by the Russian ministerial defence: an act on one of its own \"ineffective\" space objects that had been in orbit for quite some time. It had been carried out in strict conformity with international law and was not directed against anyone. Considering the time of the test and the orbit, it did not pose any threat or create any difficulties to any space stations or outer space objects or activities. With regard to other States capabilities, the Russian Federation, from the very beginning of its outer space exploration, had held to a consistent course, aimed at preventing an arms race in outer space and keeping space free for peaceful purposes.\n\nThe representative believed it was necessary to agree as quickly as possible on an international legally binding instrument to prevent an outer space arms race. Many developing countries called for that, and the Russian-Chinese draft treaty on the topic which also included prevention of the threat or use of force against outer space objects, was an answer to that. The Russian international initiative on a political commitment to refrain from a first placement of weapons in outer space was currently the only instrument to keep space free from weapons.",

Moscow \"had one message\" for the \"leading countries of the West and NATO: lets stop being enemies, lets live together\".\n\nThe White House said Putins remarks were not new and did not indicate a change in his strategic goals, including in Ukraine.\n\nReady for negotiations\n\nRussia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, triggering the biggest showdown with the West since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis in the depths of the Cold War when the Soviet Union and the US came closest to nuclear war.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been killed while the West has imposed the most severe sanctions in history on Russia, one of the worlds biggest suppliers of natural resources.\n\nPutin said Moscow was ready for talks to end the conflict in Ukraine, but said Kyiv was not prepared to sit down at the negotiating table.\n\n\"Its not a question about us, we are ready for negotiations. But the leaders in Kyiv decided not to continue negotiations with Russia,\" he said. \"It is very easy to solve this problem if Washington gives a signal to Kyiv to change its position and solve the problem peacefully.\"\n\nThere have been no peace talks between the two since attempts at a negotiated settlement fell apart in the first weeks of the conflict, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has explicitly ruled out a negotiated deal with Putin.\n\nAsked about a potential nuclear escalation, Putin said the danger of nuclear weapons usage would exist as long as nuclear arms do.\n\nMoscow has no intention to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, he said. \"We see no need for that. There is no point in that neither political nor military.\"\n\nDirty game\n\nMaria Zakharova, Russias foreign ministry spokeswoman, argued \"the more the US is drawn into supporting the Kyiv regime on the battlefield, the more they risk provoking a direct military confrontation between the biggest nuclear powers fraught with catastrophic consequences\".\n\nQuoting a 1978 Harvard lecture by Russian dissident and novelist Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, Putin said the West was openly racist and looked down on other peoples of the world.\n\n\"Power over the world is what the so-called West has put on the line in its game but the game is dangerous, bloody and I would say dirty,\" Putin said. \"The sower of the wind, as they say, will reap the storm.\"\n\nPutin cast the conflict in Ukraine as a battle between the West and Russia for the fate of the second-largest Eastern Slav country. It was, he said, partly a \"civil war\" as Russians and Ukrainians were one people. Kyiv flatly rejects both those ideas.\n\nPutin said he thought constantly of the Russian losses in Ukraine, but said only Russia could guarantee its territorial integrity.\n\n\"I have always believed and believe in common sense so I am convinced that sooner or later the new centres of the multipolar world order and the West will have to start an equal conversation about the future we share and the earlier the better,\" Putin said.",

                "cc_text": "At the recent UN General Assembly First Committee session on October 19, Chinas ambassador for disarmament affairs, Li Song, declared that \"China has solemnly committed to no first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and not using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones unconditionally.\"\n\nJust one week later, another superpower failed to make the same promise. And it wasnt Russia.\n\nOn October 25, at U.S.-sponsored talks with Japan and South Korea, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman announced that the U.S. commitment to defending Japan and South Korea is \"ironclad.\" She then explained what that meant, stating that \"we will use the full range of U.S. defense capabilities to defend our allies, including nuclear, conventional and missile defense capabilities.\"\n\nHer statement would seem to match or even exceed Russias recent provocative proclamations. Putin has said that \"in the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us.\" Putin never specifies nuclear weapons, though his remarks have been largely interpreted as such.\n\nPresumably, those weapons could be used to \"defend\" territories in Ukraine now considered part of the Russian federation, including Crimea, Donbas, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nThe U.S. statement goes beyond that. The State Department announcement states that its nuclear retaliation policy would be triggered not only by an attack on the U.S. but also by an attack on U.S. allies. And this is not an aberration. Sherman was not going rogue or speaking irresponsibly. The 2018 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review states that \"the United States would only consider the employment of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States, its allies, and partners. Extreme circumstances could include significant non-nuclear strategic attacks.\" (Editor's note: Biden's new 2022 Nuclear Posture Review announced Thursday afternoon reaffirms this statement entirely.)\n\nThe U.S. also insists that it \"has never adopted a 'no first use' policy.\" Washington, then, seems to have the most permissive nuclear first strike policy in the world today, given that its use of nuclear weapons extends to the defense of \"allies and partners\" and not just self-defense.\n\nThis is not the first time the U.S. has threatened North Korea with its ultimate firepower. In his 2017 UN address, Trump insisted that \"the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.\" A month earlier, Trump threatened that if North Korea made \"any more threats to the United States. . . . they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\"\n\nOn July 9, 1950, at the start of the Korean War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff debated \"whether or not A-bombs should be made available to MacArthur.\" Gen. Douglas MacArthur had said that he \"see[s] here a unique use for the atomic bomb.\" He would later say that he \"would have dropped 30 or so atomic bombs.\" On December 9, MacArthur requested commanders discretion to use atomic bombs, and he submitted a list of potential targets.\n\nPresident Truman, the only world leader to have ordered the use of atomic bombs, made the threat public in a November 1950 press conference, when he warned that the U.S. might use any weapon in its arsenal. While Truman was speaking, Air Force General George Stratemeyer put the Strategic Air Command on warning to be prepared to dispatch bombers with nuclear capabilities.\n\nIn his book The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner, Daniel Ellsberg says that \"when Eisenhower arrived in the White House, the Korean War was stalemated. Eisenhower ended the impasse in a hurry. He secretly got word to the Chinese that he would drop nuclear bombs on North Korea unless a truce was signed immediately.\" When Eisenhower was asked how the Korean War had ended, Ellsberg adds, he answered that it was due to the \"danger of an atomic war.\"\n\nEllsberg also reports that, in 1995, the Clinton administration secretly threatened North Korea that it could use nuclear weapons against North Koreas nuclear reactor program.\n\nIt is because of this history, North Korea insists, that they have acquired a nuclear weapons program as a deterrent to U.S. threats. Kim Jong-un has said that \"unless the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and the nuclear threat are fundamentally resolved, we will not put nuclear and ballistic rockets on the negotiating table under any circumstances.\"\n\nNorth Koreas recent legislation declaring itself a nuclear weapons state declares that it will \"never give up\" its nuclear weapons. In his speech marking the passage of the nuclear state legislation, Kim Jong-un said that \"as long as nuclear weapons exist on Earth, and imperialism and the anti-North Korean maneuvers of the U.S. and its followers remain, our road to strengthening our nuclear force will never end.\"\n\nOn December 9, 1981, the UN passed the Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear Catastrophe. It reaffirms that \"the universally accepted objective is to eliminate completely the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons.\" It then pledges to \"solemnly proclaim\" that \"any doctrines allowing the first use of nuclear weapons . . . are incompatible with human moral standards and the lofty ideals of the United Nations.\"\n\nAs the world recklessly navigates its way through the most dangerous nuclear threat in decades, it is time to take seriously superpower boasts that they respect international law and the international order. Respecting international law includes respecting the declaration that first use nuclear policies, like those recently articulated by the U.S. and Russia, \"are incompatible with . . . the lofty ideals of the United Nations.\"",

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nBritain, France, and the United States issued a joint statement on October 23 dismissing the claim after Shoigu's calls with their defense ministers in which the Russian minister presented no evidence for the claim.\n\n\"Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia's transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory,\" according to the statement.\n\nBut Russia doubled down on its assertions, which come after weeks of military defeats for Russia in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"According to the information we have, two organizations in Ukraine have specific instructions to create a so-called dirty bomb. This work is in its final stage,\" Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov said on October 24.\n\nLater the same day, the chief of the Russian General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, spoke by phone with British Chief of Defense Staff Tony Radakin, who rejected Russia's allegations that Ukraine is planning actions to escalate the conflict.\n\n\"The military leaders both agreed on the importance of maintaining open channels of communication between the U.K. and Russia to manage the risk of miscalculation and to facilitate de-escalation,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nGerasimov also held a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, General Mark Milley, to discuss the risks of the use of a dirty bomb in Ukraine, according to the Kremlin-controlled RIA Novosti news agency.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg weighed in on Moscow's repeated allegation on October 24 , saying NATO also rejects it.\n\nStoltenberg said he had spoken with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace \"about Russia's false claim that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory.\"\n\n\"NATO Allies reject this allegation. Russia must not use it as a pretext for escalation. We remain steadfast in our support for Ukraine,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nMoscow's claims that Ukraine could employ a dirty bomb raised concern that Russia could use such a device and blame Kyiv.\n\nA senior U.S. military official said the United States has seen no indication that Russia has decided to use nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons in Ukraine, including a dirty bomb.\n\nThe official, who spoke to journalists on condition of anonymity, also said the Ukrainians are not building a dirty bomb.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price also said the United States has not seen any indication that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon but said there would be consequences for Russia whether it used a dirty bomb or any other nuclear weapon.\n\n\"It would certainly be another example of [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin's brutality, if he were to use a so called 'dirty bomb.' There would be consequences for Russia whether it uses a 'dirty bomb' or a nuclear bomb. We've been very clear about that,\" Price told reporters.\n\nHe did not provide details about those consequences.\n\nUkraine earlier called the accusation that Kyiv was building a dirty bomb absurd, and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog accepted his request to send experts to Ukraine to refute Moscow's claim.\n\nKuleba said he invited the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to \"urgently send experts to peaceful facilities in Ukraine which Russia deceitfully claims to be developing a dirty bomb.\"\n\nKuleba said Ukraine has always been transparent and has \"nothing to hide.\"\n\nThe IAEA said later on October 24 that it was preparing to send inspectors to two Ukrainian sites.\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Grossi confirmed in a statement that both locations are under IAEA safeguards and have been visited regularly by the agency's inspectors.\n\nThe IAEA \"is aware of statements made by the Russian Federation on [October 23] about alleged activities at two nuclear locations in Ukraine,\" Grossi said, adding that both were already subject to its inspections and one was inspected a month ago and no undeclared nuclear activities or material were found.\n\n\"The IAEA is preparing to visit the locations in the coming days,\" it added.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Kuleba in a phone call on October 23 that the world would \"see through any attempt by Russia to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation [of the war].\"\n\nBlinken and Kuleba discussed the U.S. and international commitment to continue supporting Ukraine with \"unprecedented security, economic and humanitarian assistance for as long as it takes, as we hold Russia accountable,\" the State Department's call readout said.\n\nThey further noted ongoing efforts to manage the broader implications of the Kremlins war in Ukraine, it added.\n\nWith reporting by AFP",

                "cc_text": "State media in Russia today put forward a new twist on so far completely unsubstantiated claims that Ukrainian forces are planning to detonate a so-called \"dirty bomb\" in the country and blame it on their Russian opponents. The new and extremely over-complicated claim is authorities in Ukraine plan to build a mock Russian Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile, load it with hazardous nuclear material, and then shoot it down or blow it up over the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.\n\nAll week, President Vladimir Putin and other senior Russian officials have continued to push evidenceless dirty bomb allegations, in general, prompting fears that this could be a prelude to some kind of nuclear false flag operation or a pretext for some other serious escalation. You can read more about how this narrative has already been evolving in The War Zone's previous reporting on the issue here.\n\nRussian state media outlet Sputnik reported the new purported fake Iskander dirty bomb plot today in a brief story cited to a single unnamed \"source familiar with the situation.\" Unlike a true nuclear weapon, a dirty bomb is a conventional explosive device intended to spread dangerous radioactive material. Experts have long debated the actual threat such a weapon might pose, but it certainly has the potential to spark panic and chaos due to the nature of its components.\n\n\"Experts from the Yuzhmash plant have already made a dummy missile of the Iskander system, the head cluster part of which is planned to be filled with radioactive material, and then 'shot down' by Ukrainian air defense forces over the exclusion zone of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in order to declare a Russian launch of a nuclear charge,\" Sputnik claimed the source told the outlet. \"After the dummy is shot down, the Kiev [Kyiv] authorities intend to show the Western and Ukrainian media fragments of the mockup and electronics of the alleged Iskander missile in order to convince the Western public of Russia's guilt.\"\n\nThe source also allegedly said that an older, smaller, and otherwise unrelated Tochka-U short-range ballistic missile a Soviet-era type originally made in Russia that both Russian and Ukrainian forces have employed in the current conflict would be used as the basis for the faux Iskander.\n\nYuzhmash, now called Pivdenmash, is a Ukrainian aerospace conglomerate that was founded in the Soviet era and has a long history of involvement in the development of ballistic missiles, as well as space launch rockets. However, neither Sputnik nor its 'source' provided any evidence to substantiate these claims.\n\nOfficials in Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations about potential nuclear or radiological provocations including about potential dirty bomb usage on multiple occasions since Russia launched its all-out invasion in February. The Russian military's seizure of the now-defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and areas of the surrounding exclusion zone that was put into place after the infamous disaster there in 1986, in the opening phases of the conflict triggered one round of allegations. Ukrainian forces have since liberated those areas. More recently, similar concerns have and continue to surround Russia's occupation of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in southeastern Ukraine.\n\nHowever, this new round of dirty bomb allegations appears to have picked up steam with claims Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu made during phone calls with various Western officials this past weekend, including U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Other Russian officials, including President Putin and other very senior individuals, have since amplified those allegations without providing any specific evidence.\n\n\"The country [Ukraine] has effectively lost its sovereignty,\" Putin said at a meeting today of Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) officials. It \"is now being directly controlled by the U.S., who use it as a battering ram against Russia, against our Union State with the Republic of Belarus, and against the CSTO [Collective Security Treaty Organization] and the CIS in general.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin. Alexei Babushkin/TASS\n\nThe CIS is a regional political, economic, and security bloc that currently consists of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The CSTO is a separate military alliance with only Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan making up its present membership.\n\n\"They pump it [Ukraine] with weapons, including heavy ones,\" the Russian President continued. \"There are also plans to use a so-called 'dirty bomb' for provocations.\"\n\nFor their part, American officials, since Shoigu's mention of Ukrainian ditty bomb threats this past weekend, have categorically rejected these claims as \"transparently false.\" British, French, and Turkish authorities, among others, have also soundly dismissed the allegations as entirely unfounded.\n\nWhat risks there may or may not be that the Russian government's dirty bomb rhetoric is a prelude to a false flag attack or some other kind of nuclear or radiological provocation, which could then be twisted into a pretext for further escalation, are unclear.\n\nUkrainian officials have reported that Russian forces appear to have stolen radioactive material from the Chernobyl site during their occupation. Authorities in Ukraine have downplayed the potential threats those items might pose even if fashioned into a dirty bomb, but it does raise concerns about the possibility of building a device with a distinctly Ukrainian radioactive signature.\n\nUkrainian authorities have also raised concerns about reported unexplained construction the Russians are carrying out at ZNPP. The work is reportedly taking place at the plant's Spent Nuclear Fuel Dry Storage Facility, where 174 separate containers full of spent nuclear fuel are stored.\n\n\"Destruction of these containers as a result of an explosion may lead to a radiation accident and radiation contamination of several hundred square kilometers of the adjacent territory,\" officials at Energoatom, Ukraine's state-run nuclear enterprise, said in a statement yesterday, adding that they feared the Russians were \"preparing a terrorist act.\" Though Russia's exact intentions at ZNPP are currently unclear, simply blowing up a nuclear waste storage facility would be one relatively easy way to create a dirty bomb.\n\nOfficials in Russia certainly have a past history of making claiming rebels or foreign actors in Syria were planning or responsible for chemical weapon attacks as a cover for the use of those weapons by forces loyal to Syrian dictator Bashar Al Asad. However, Russian allegations were not always followed by regime attacks.\n\nThat uncertainty is in many ways a weapon unto itself. It would fit perfectly well with the rest of the Russian government's misinformation and disinformation playbooks, which typically center on distracting attention from Russia's own malign activities and generally casting aspersions about its opponents and critics to muddy the waters.\n\nObservers have already noted that some of the materials Russian authorities have put out to go along with the dirty bomb claims which provide no specific supporting evidence very much look to be repurposed materials first created to go along with the equally unsubstantiated allegations of a potential Ukrainian nuclear provocation at ZNPP. Those claims, which had also prompted fears of a possible false flag operation or other escalation from Russia, did not lead directly to any actual nuclear or radiological incident at the power plant.\n\nA post from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' official Twitter account regarding the dirty bomb claims also included imagery that the Slovenian Radioactive Waste Management Agency, or ARAO, created for professional presentations in 2010. The image has since been used to illustrate various nuclear and radiological news reports, including one about a completely unrelated incident in Mexico in 2016.\n\nBeyond that, in his comments at the CIS meeting today, Putin packaged the dirty bomb claims together with accusations about U.S.-supported \"biological experiments\" in Ukraine and American-backed efforts by the country to acquire true nuclear weapons. Both of these conspiratorial assertions, which other Russian officials have brought up recently, too, are now months old and completely unsupported.\n\nWhether the new dirty bomb claims are directly linked to any machinations or not, Russian authorities have a clear incentive to try to find ways to distract, both domestically and abroad, from the steady losses to Ukrainian forces in recent months. Ukraine's offensives have been bolstered by an equally steady flow of military assistance from the United States and other Western countries. Those aid packages have also been expanding in scope, notably increasingly including more and more long-range precision artillery systems and more modern air defenses, among other materiel.\n\nU.S. and other government officials, as well as experts and observers, do continue to assess that the risk of Russia actually 'going nuclear' to try to alter the course of the conflict remains low due to a variety of factors, as The War Zone has previously explored in depth. This, of course, does not mean that there is no such risk.\n\nWhat is clear is that Russian officials, amplified by reports from state media, are very actively pushing unsubstantiated claims about Ukrainian plans to set off a dirty bomb. Coupled with other highly provocative rhetoric, this seems likely to continue, at least for the immediate future, to prompt fears that more may be afoot on the Russian side.",

                "cc_text": "Escalation is a cornerstone of Russian President Vladimir Putins strategy in his war against Ukraine, especially as Ukrainian counter-offensives have steadily rolled back Russian gains. As his setbacks mount, its important to address some key questions: How can Ukraine and its partners prevent further escalation to the nuclear level while denying Russia a chance to seize victory from the jaws of defeat. And if such escalation occurs, how should the West respond?\n\nAfter the initial attack on Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities, Russian escalation has occurred in several phases in response to its losses on the battlefield. These include the artillery assault in the Donbas, Russias mobilization, illegal annexations and martial law in four oblasts, probable sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, and massive recent attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure.\n\nIn each case, Russian escalation was aimed at gaining battlefield advantage and breaking Ukraines will. It has not succeeded in either purpose. Nevertheless, Putin will undoubtedly escalate again in the face of failure to achieve his shrinking war aims and to stave off strategic defeat. Ignoring his threats to escalate further, including through the use of nuclear weapons, is not sound policy. Instead, measures need to be in place to deter and, if necessary, respond to this threat in ways that impose heavy costs for Russian misbehavior but do not further escalate the conflict.\n\nFurther escalation will depend on the battlefield situation\n\nUkraine has used the arms the United States and its NATO allies have provided to launch successful counter-offensives in the Kharkiv region and in parts of the Kherson region, and it has clawed back some of Russias mid-summer gains in Donbas. The jury is out as to whether these events will lead to a collapse of the Russian military effort in Ukraine or to a prolonged stalemate. While there are many signs of potential Russian military collapse, Russian forces are now digging in with the natural advantages of defensive positions. With more competent leadership under General Sergei Surovikin and additional manpower through mobilization, Moscow may be able to break the Ukrainian momentum and sustain a stalemate for some time.\n\nPutin is unlikely to escalate to the tactical nuclear level if his forces manage to stabilize the battle lines. In that case, he would probably pursue his objectives through a war of attrition, continued efforts to impose a ceasefire, and attempts to divide NATO with calls for negotiations that would prevent Ukraine from recovering any more lost territory.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the United States and NATO should continue their successful policy of arms transfers to Kyiv, focusing on increased numbers of high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), long-range artillery, offensive drones, modern tanks, and armored fighting vehicles to retake lost territory. In addition, they should supply air-defense and counter-drone systems to deal with Russias attack on Ukrainian cities. They should continue to do their utmost to achieve a Ukrainian victoryat least the recovery of most territory occupied since February 24 while avoiding escalating to a NATO-Russian war. Despite Russian rhetoric about a \"proxy war\" with the United States and NATO, Putin is keen to avoid direct NATO involvement, especially given the decimation of Russian equipment and manpower.\n\nCan negotiations prevent further escalation?\n\nThe battlefield situation is not ripe for negotiations at this time. Russia has the largest incentive to establish a ceasefire that would allow it to retain Ukrainian territory it now occupies and that it risks losing to the Ukrainian counter-offensive.\n\nSince the Kharkiv offensive, Ukraine has been on a roll militarily and has little reason to negotiate given Russian brutality against civilians, rampant war crimes, and efforts to eradicate Ukrainian national identity. Ukraine has also shifted its declared war aims from recovering all territory occupied since February 24 to recapturing all territory lost since 2014, including Crimea. There is zero interest in Kyiv in giving Putin any concessions when Russia is still demanding Ukraines political subjugation and demilitarization. Washington has stated that it will leave it to Ukraine to decide if and when to negotiate, effectively letting Ukraine strengthen its negotiating leverage on the battlefield before sitting down at the negotiating table.\n\nIf Ukraine can recapture more territory quickly, without further Russian escalation, then negotiations may not be needed. However, the need for a negotiated solution might increase if Russia can create a stalemate on the battlefield. If Ukraine continues with its successful counter-offensives, Putin might seek to force negotiations on Kyiv by further escalating the conflict.\n\nThe history of the Cuban Missile Crisis teaches us that US President John F. Kennedy was able to negotiate the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba by showing strength with a military quarantine but also by providing Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev with a fig leaf, the removal of obsolete Jupiter missiles from Turkey. Should negotiations be required to end the Ukraine war, a similar formula may be needed.\n\nFor any negotiations to work, better channels of communication to the Kremlin will also be needed. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has just taken one important step in that direction with his recent phone conversations with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. More direct communications are needed to reduce the danger of unintended escalation.\n\nPossible options for Russian nuclear escalation\n\nPutin has threatened further escalation, implying that he might use nuclear weapons and stating that he is \"not bluffing.\" But Moscow has not indicated what the threshold for such escalation might beit may not know itselfand it may be a calculated bluff. Potential triggers for further escalation might include a Ukrainian victory in Kherson, additional successful Ukrainian military strikes or sabotage attacks in Crimea, the collapse or mass desertions of whole Russian military units in Ukraine, attacks on Russian cities by Ukrainian forces, the provision of long-range precision strike weapons to Ukraine by NATO, or the near-collapse of the Putin regime in Moscow.\n\nMany analysts expect that if Putin actually escalated to nuclear use, it would be either a demonstration shot over the Black Sea or a limited tactical strike against Ukrainian forces. That tactical strike (using a very low-yield device) might include one or several targets, depending on what Putin believes is required to force Kyivs capitulation. Few believe that Putin would strike a NATO country, since that would mean an instant, losing war with NATO. However, a strike against a city in Western Ukraine cannot be ruled out. His purpose would be to turn European and especially German opinion against further support for Ukraine and to convince Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he has no option but to accept a settlement on Russias terms.\n\nMore creative non-nuclear attacks should also not be ruled out: for example a dirty bomb (which Russia recently accused Ukraine of preparing to use in a false flag operation), a massive cyber strike, a limited poison gas attack against Ukrainian troops (as happened in Syria), the destruction of a major dam, or more severe attacks on a Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\n\nIs Putin bluffing?\n\nMany Western analysts believe that Putin is indeed bluffing with regard to nuclear use. They argue:\n\nA small tactical battlefield strike would have little military value since Ukrainian troops are generally dispersed and Ukraine would fight on.\n\nThe radiation would affect Russian as well as Ukrainian troops.\n\nPutins chain of command would stop him.\n\nPutin would back down because nuclear use is probably a red line for China and India, countries that Putin needs as friends for diplomatic and economic purposes.\n\nOthers take the nuclear threat more seriously. They argue:\n\n\"Escalate to deescalate\" (a strategy of limited nuclear strikes to force NATO to end a conventional conflict on Russian terms)has been the Russian doctrine for years.\n\nPutins purpose would be not to win on the battlefield but to freeze the battle and force a ceasefire or armistice on Russian terms.\n\nPutin has demonstrated his brutality in Chechnya, Syria, and Ukraine.\n\nIf Putin believes his regime or the viability of the Russian Federation is at stake, he will not hesitate to use any weapons available to him.\n\nPutin might believe that the Western coalition would crumble over a response.\n\nAssuming that Putin is bluffing is not sound policy. The West has consistently miscalculated that Putin does not mean what he says. Douglas London, a former Central Intelligence Agency operations officer for Russia, argues that as a former Cold War KGB operative, Putin will probably \"use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons if he believes doing so is the only means to preserve his power.\" Assuming that regime change in Moscow will solve the escalation problem is also not sound policy, since Putins successor is likely to have a similar KGB background and anti-Western world view.\n\nTaking the nuclear threat seriously does not mean withdrawing support for a Ukrainian victory or holding back on arms transfers. It does mean continuing to calculate the escalation risk of future NATO arms transfer decisions and to continue prudent planning about ways to deter and respond to such an attack.\n\nOptions for deterring and responding to nuclear use\n\nA prudent planner must hedge against and seek to deter the threat of nuclear use. Getting the deterrence balance right is critical. The response needs to be painful enough to deter but not certain enough to lock in the responder to any one course of action should deterrence fail.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to do this by publicly stating that there would be \"catastrophic consequences\" for Russia if it crossed the nuclear threshold. And it has privately provided some details about the nature of the US and Western response to leave Putin in no doubt that the costs of nuclear use, even a \"demonstration\" strike, would outweigh any benefits.\n\nAn array of responses to a nuclear strike (or use of any other weapons of mass destruction) would be available to NATO should deterrence fail. The mix would depend upon the nature of the Russian strike. The tools in ascending order of severity and risk might include the following.\n\nMeasures that would seek to punish Russia with limited risk of further nuclear escalation:\n\nSeeking unanimous diplomatic condemnation for nuclear use at the United Nations.\n\nRemoving Russia from international organizations.\n\nRemoving Russia completely from the SWIFT financial messaging system.\n\nImposing a full trade and financial embargo on Russia (with the support of China and India).\n\nUsing seized Russian financial assets for Ukrainian reconstruction.\n\nAgreeing on a date for Ukrainian membership in the European Union.\n\nMeasures that would punish Russia with some risk of further escalation:\n\nLifting the tacit limits on the provision to Ukraine of longer-range or more offensive weapons such as Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), F-16 fighter jets, and modern main battle tanks.\n\nAllowing Ukraine to use NATO long-range weapons to target areas in Russia.\n\nSending some NATO military advisors to Ukraine for non-combat missions.\n\nAgreeing on a date for Ukrainian membership in NATO.\n\nMeasures that would punish Russia with a higher risk of further escalation:\n\nAttacking Russian forces in Ukraine with NATO troops, for example destroying the site from which the Russian nuclear strike was launched.\n\nAttacking Russias Black Sea fleet with NATO aircraft.\n\nResponding with an in-kind NATO nuclear strike on a Russian military target in Ukraine.\n\nA prudent national security team would move carefully down this list, seeking ways to significantly punish Russia while maintaining escalation control. Allies may be reluctant to support an in-kind nuclear response, but for the sake of deterrence, NATO should preserve a measure of ambiguity about its readiness to use tactical nuclear weapons in some scenarios.\n\nHans Binnendijk is a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council.

It's really hard.\"\n\nAlyona says when she first met a Russian soldier, he asked her \"who allowed you to live so well?\" Her family's wooden house was left nearly empty after the Russians took everything away.\n\nFighting is starting to concentrate around the city of Kherson. There's an almost constant rumbling of artillery about 16km away.\n\nAs Russia's grip on Kherson continues to weaken, fears grow of it deploying an \"scorched earth\" policy.\n\nMoscow-installed politicians have recently been \"evacuating\" people. Ukraine has accused Russian troops of preparing to blow up the nearby Kakhovka dam. Russia denies this but if it happened Kyiv says it would lead to 80 settlements being flooded.\n\nThey believe it indicates an \"if we can't have it, no one can\" approach.\n\nFor Ukraine, liberation here is fiercely contested as well as complicated. Also, if achieved, it doesn't bring immediate relief.\n\nYet in the words of the Ukrainian soldier Gadfly, \"what choice do we have\"?\n\n- BBC",
