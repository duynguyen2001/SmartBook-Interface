The consequences of this could lead to a heightened state of military readiness and an emergency response from the impacted nation's government and military (5).

Should such an incident be perceived as an \"armed attack\" under NATO's Article 5, it could potentially trigger a collective defense response despite not being a deliberate act of aggression, which raises questions about the appropriate threshold for invoking mutual defense clauses and the risks of escalation in high-tension situations (3,4,5,6). This underscores the importance of thorough investigation and cautious response to avoid misinterpretation and unintentional conflict expansion, especially considering the nuclear capabilities of involved states and the catastrophic consequences of miscalculated retaliatory actions (8,9).\n\nMoreover, the potential for an \"imperial slide\" exists when intervening powers may overstep sovereignty norms under the guise of protective measures, which could erode the targeted country's sovereignty and contribute to geopolitical instability (2). The G20's recent joint statement, while not a forum for resolving security issues, acknowledges the significant economic repercussions that security matters can have on the global stage, suggesting a need for a nuanced approach to incidents of inadvertent strikes that balances the principles of national sovereignty, self-defense, and international cooperation (7,10). The emphasis on cooperative approaches and the strategic use of technology such as drones in augmenting security highlights the evolving nature of modern warfare and the corresponding need for updated frameworks in international law and engagement rules (2,7)."

Upon consulting with allies at the G20 Summit in Indonesia, Biden indicated that the initial trajectory analysis suggested it was \"unlikely\" that the missile was fired from Russia (2,3,4). This assessment was based on the path the missile would have taken, which did not align with a launch from within Russian territory according to the early data (1). The president emphasized the importance of a full investigation before making a definitive statement, underscoring that while the trajectory pointed away from a Russian origin, conclusive evidence was still necessary (2,4).\n\nIn the aftermath of the explosion, the analysis of the missile's trajectory informed discussions among NATO and G7 leaders during an emergency meeting led by Biden in Bali. The trajectory was a key piece of evidence that led to the consideration of alternative explanations, including the possibility that the missile was accidentally launched by Ukrainian air defenses during an attempt to intercept a Russian missile (6,7). Moreover, Biden's reliance on the trajectory analysis was mirrored in statements by NATO officials and other U.S. officials who also mentioned preliminary assessments that pointed to Ukrainian forces as the potential source of the missile (8). The consistent reference to the trajectory by Biden and other leaders indicates its significant role in shaping the international response and the direction of the ongoing investigation (1,6,8)."

This suggests a focus on condemning Russia's ongoing aggression while avoiding premature conclusions about the specific explosion in Poland, as President Joe Biden indicated it was \"unlikely\" the missile came from Russia (3).

This deliberate ambiguity may be interpreted as a cautious approach to assigning blame, especially in light of President Biden's comments suggesting it was \"unlikely\" the missile originated from Russia, and preliminary assessments indicating it may have been a Ukrainian defense missile meant to intercept a Russian attack (4,7).\n\nThe international community's perception of the incident's accountability is further complicated by the G20's earlier declaration, which mirrored the G7's cautious language and acknowledged differing views on the situation and sanctions (1). This diplomatic hedging is seen as a means to avoid an immediate escalation, particularly given the broader geopolitical context and the need to maintain a united front in support of Ukraine without exacerbating tensions with Russia. With the G7 and G20's measured response, the international community is left to grapple with the implications of a NATO member being struck during the conflict and the potential that this was an unintended consequence of Ukraine's defense measures, rather than a direct Russian provocation (2,3,6,8,9,10)."

However, ambiguity surrounding the missile's origin, especially amid a major Russian offensive in Ukraine, complicates the situation and necessitates a careful response to avoid further escalation (2,3). Moreover, there are expectations of repercussions from NATO and the European Union, particularly since Polish citizens were casualties, which could lead to a nuanced diplomatic and military response (5).",

This scenario could test the cohesion of Western allies, which has been strong up to this point, and raise the costs associated with sustaining a prolonged war, as well as the future reconstruction of Ukraine (1).\n\nMoreover, such an incident could have geopolitical implications beyond the immediate military response (4). It would also impact diplomatic relations and the ongoing support for Ukraine, potentially altering the perception of the conflict in the eyes of international observers (5,6). The need for a careful and measured response would be paramount to prevent further escalation, as global leaders, including the US President, have expressed a desire to avoid World War III (8). It is crucial that the investigation's findings guide the next steps, as any premature or misjudged action could lead to unintended and possibly severe consequences for the region and the world at large (6,7,9,10)."

Additionally, G20 leaders can issue declarations that condemn acts of aggression and call for the withdrawal of forces, as seen in the draft declaration at the end of the Bali summit, although this must account for differing views among member states (3).

This approach aligns with the participatory model of accountability discussed in the context of drone warfare, where multilateral constraints and international approval are sought to legitimize operations and protect against civilian casualties, suggesting a framework that G20 nations could adopt to prevent escalation (1). \n\nFurthermore, the G20 leaders' draft declaration condemning the war in Ukraine and the joint statements at both the G20 and APEC summits illustrate a shared commitment to addressing conflict through unified messaging and careful consideration of actions (3,5). The agreement brokered by Turkey and the UN to secure Ukrainian grain transport via the Black Sea is an example of urgent actions being taken to address global challenges arising from conflicts (6). Additionally, G20 leaders, including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, have emphasized the importance of working together with allies to mitigate the economic consequences of conflicts and to provide a counterpoint to authoritarian regimes (7). These instances demonstrate a collective effort to use diplomatic channels and international cooperation to manage and prevent conflicts, which can serve as a model for G20 nations in dealing with similar incidents in the future (3,6,7)."

                "cc_text": "Two officials briefed on initial US assessments said it appears the missile that killed two people in eastern Poland Wednesday originated in Ukraine, even though it was Russian made. The official said that assessment is what President Joe Biden appeared to be alluding to in his remarks earlier when he said it was \"unlikely\" the missile originated in Russia, The officials said intelligence assessments had been discussed at the emergency meeting called by Biden on the margins of the G20 summit in Bali and would also be a topic of conversation at a meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels. The joint statement after the G7 meeting was also deliberately ambiguous when it came to the incident, putting far more focus on the dozens of strikes that happened in the hours before the missives crossed into Poland. A spokesperson with the US National Security Council declined to comment on reports that the Russian-made missile that landed in eastern Poland killing two people was fired by Ukrainian forces trying to intercept a Russian attack. \"We have no comment and will not be confirming this report. As the President said today, we support Poland's ongoing investigation to figure out exactly what happened,\" the spokesman said. Earlier, President Biden said preliminary information suggests it is unlikely the missile that landed in Poland was fired from Russia after consulting with allies at the G20 Summit in Indonesia. \"I don't want to say that [it was fired from Russia] until we completely investigate,\" Biden went on. \"It's unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia. But we'll see.\" Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have used Russian-made munitions during the nine-month conflict. CNN has previously reported that Ukraine has used Russian-made missiles as part of their air defense system. These older-generation weapons systems date back to the period when both Russia and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union. In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not explicitly deny reports the missile originated in Ukraine but emphasized Russia's responsibility for starting the war. \"There is only one logic to be followed,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the Office of the Ukrainian President, said. \"The war was started and is being waged by Russia. Russia is massively attacking Ukraine with cruise missiles. Russia has turned the eastern part of the European continent into an unpredictable battlefield. Intent, means of execution, risks, escalation it is all coming from Russia alone.\" \"And there can be no other explanation for any missile incident here. So when an aggressor country launches a deliberate, massive missile strike against a large country on the European continent with its obsolete Soviet-era weapons (Kh -class missiles), tragedy sooner or later occurs on the territories of other states as well.\"",

A senior Canadian government official said the two spoke about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, North Korea and climate change, and that Trudeau also raised \"our serious concerns around interference activities in Canada.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.\n\nAsked later at a news conference about the confrontation, Trudeau said \"not every conversation is always going to be easy, but it's extremely important that we continue to stand up for the things that are important for Canadians.\"\n\nForeign Minister Mlanie Joly also said she discussed Chinese interference with her Chinese counterpart at the G-20.\n\nJoly remarked last week that China is an increasingly disruptive, global power and warned businesses against deepening their ties, saying there were \"geopolitical risks.\"\n\nCanadian police charged a Hydro-Qubec employee on Monday with espionage for allegedly sending trade secrets to China. And Beijing's ties with Ottawa nosedived after Canadian authorities arrested a top executive from Chinese tech giant Huawei who had been charged with fraud by the U.S.\n\nChina jailed two Canadians shortly after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, Huawei Technologies' chief financial officer and the daughter of the company's founder, on a U.S. extradition request. They were sent back to Canada last year, the same day Meng returned to China after reaching a deal with U.S. authorities in her case.\n\nMany countries labeled China's action \"hostage politics,\" while China has described the charges against Huawei and Meng as a politically motivated attempt to hold back China's economic and technological development.\n\nCanada has banned wireless carriers from installing Huawei equipment in its high-speed 5G networks, joining allies in shunning the company that has close links with the ruling Communist Party and its military wing, the People's Liberation Army.",

Member countries must come together to evaluate a situation and determine whether it should be triggered. It was not triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February because Ukraine is not a part of NATO.

But what he got might be just enough to irritate his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. The Biden administration had been hoping the summit, which brought together the worlds 20 largest economies, would produce a communiqu that strongly condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, with as many nations as possible signing on. The document released at the end of the conference is carefully worded, with the feel of a hard-fought compromise. The section on Ukraine says that \"most members\" strongly condemned the war and the \"immense human suffering\" it has caused, while noting that \"there were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions.\" There is no breakdown provided of which members fell into which group. But G-20 members like China, India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, which have stronger relationships with Moscow, have largely refrained from publicly criticizing Russia over its actions and tried to appear neutral in the conflict. Alex Brandon / AFP - Getty Images The language also does not explicitly fault Russia, another G-20 member. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who attended the summit in place of Putin, had accused Western countries on Tuesday of trying to \"politicize\" the joint statement. In another passage that seems at least partly aimed at Putin, the statement says \"the use or threat of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.\" The Russian president has denied that he intends to use nuclear weapons to reverse battlefield losses, but he raised alarms in September when he warned that he was prepared to use \"all means available to protect Russia.\" Communiqus tend to have a short shelf life, of interest mainly to the diplomats who negotiate and write them. Still, when Putin sees the document it is hard to imagine hell be pleased.

Hope everyone had a restful and wonderful holiday.\n\nOkay, Im going to be really quick at the top. As you see, we have a guest as you know, we have a guest from National Security Council, John Kirby, with us today whos going to take your questions ahead of the state visit. As you know, that will be happening on Thursday our first state visit with France. And first state visit, clearly, with in this administration.\n\nSo, with that, Im going to just start right away and turn it over to Kirby.\n\nAll right, John.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Thank you so much, Karine.\n\nWell, as Karine said, Ive just got a couple of comments here at the top about the state visit. As the first state visit of the Biden-Harris administration, this is an opportunity to highlight a foundational component of this administrations approach to foreign policy, and thats through alliances.\n\nFrance is a vital global partner and, of course, the United States oldest ally.\n\nOur economic ties span established and cutting-edge sectors, with major investments in both directions supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs in each country.\n\nOur defense and security cooperation continues to expand and, of course, is vital to peace and stability all around the world.\n\nOur partnership in tackling tough global challenges is underpinned by our shared commitment to democratic principles, values, and institutions.\n\nAnd our cultural ties remain a source of strength and importance to our bilateral relationship. France remains, as you know, a top destination for many Americans and vice versa.\n\nSo, just briefly on the schedule breakdown: On Wednesday, President Macron will join Vice President Harris in visiting NASA headquarters to showcase our deepening collaboration on space, in support of Earth, climate, and space science and space exploration.\n\nThe bulk of the state visit events will take place on Thursday, starting with the official arrival ceremony. While then while President Biden and President Macron conduct a bilateral discussion, there will be a separate program for the First Lady and Mrs. Macron.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Vice President and Secretary Blinken will host a luncheon at the State Department in honor of President and Mrs. Macron.\n\nAnd then, of course, the visit culminates in the state dinner here at the White House that evening.\n\nThroughout all of these events, you can expe- you can expect to see on display both our long, shared history as allies, as well as our deep partnership in taking on the most urgent global challenges of today and tomorrow.\n\nWe anticipate that well have more to share about the details of the state dinner and the guest list later this week.\n\nWhile there are specific areas where we anticipate well make progress during this visit, I want to stress that this visit really largely serves as a celebration of the strong footing of this relationship one that is well rooted in our history from the very beginnings of our country, while also oriented squarely toward the future. And its a very dynamic, exciting future that were looking forward to.\n\nWith that, Ill take some questions.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Andrea, do you want to go first?\n\nQ Yeah. So, John, I wonder if you could just say a few words about why France was chosen for the first state visit. I know you sort of talked about the historic ties, but is this also, kind of, you know, a gesture in terms of making making the relationship a little smoother after the AUKUS dust of last year?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I kind of alluded to it in the answer, Andrea. A real kind of a long pole in the tent for President Bidens approach to foreign policy and to the world around us is the is the strength and power of alliances. And our alliance is something that no other nation in the world can match the network of American alliances. France is our oldest one.\n\nAnd, I mean, if you look at whats going on in Ukraine, look at whats going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things. And President Macron has been a dynamic leader inside the G7, particularly there in Europe.\n\nAnd so, the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.\n\nQ Can I just follow up on that? One big issue that is dividing the U.S. and Europe at this moment is are the EV credits in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah.\n\nQ This is an issue I mean, I realize the way the EU is structured you know, the EU, Brussels, (inaudible) trade policy. Do you expect that issue to come up? Do you think theres any chance of resolving that, short of a WTO, you know, dispute?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I think, certainly, that the issue will most likely come up. I think we look forward to having that discussion with our French counterparts.\n\nAs you know, last month, the United States stood up helped stood up stand up an EU-U.S. IRA taskforce, just last month, to try to make sure that we can better understand the concerns of our European friends about this and so many other issues.\n\nThe bottom line for us is, first of all, we want to understand the concerns. Were absolutely willing to have that conversation and to find a way to work through those issues of concern. But its not a zero-sum game. I mean, clean energy thats a tide that raises all boats, the more we can transition to a clean energy economy around the world. And theres plenty of opportunity for everybody in that.\n\nSo were looking forward to having those discussions.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine and John. On a different topic, I was hoping what is the White Houses message, the Presidents message to people in China who are peaceably protesting COVID lockdowns there? And then, did the topic of Chinas zero-COVID policy come up in the Presidents bilateral meeting with President Xi when they met in Indonesia a couple weeks ago?\n\nMR. KIRBY: They did talk about COVID and the effect that the pandemic had had around the world. Clearly, that came up inside the conversation. I dont know if, specifically, the zero-COVID policy was an issue of discussion, but certainly COVID was on the agenda, as you might expect that it would be.\n\nAnd our message to peaceful protesters around the world is the same and consistent: People should be allowed the right to assemble and to peacefully protest policies or laws or dictates that they take issue with.\n\nQ Does the White House support their efforts to sort of regain personal freedoms in light of these lockdowns?\n\nMR. KIRBY: The White House supports the right of peaceful protest.\n\nQ And then, on a different topic, the State Department announced today that Russia abruptly canceled the latest rounds of arms negotiations.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah.\n\nQ Is the present plan to reach out to anybody about that? Is there any White House reaction to that?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont have any phone calls or conversations to read out. What youre talking about is the Bilateral Consultative Commission. And this is a component of the New START Treaty that was signed on to in 2010. This is a its basically an opportunity for both sides to get together and talk about the technicalities, the formalities, the compliance mechanisms that are in place with respect to New START.\n\nThis would have been the first one that we would have put in place since COVID, which obviously prevented those kinds of face-to-face meetings, so we very much were looking forward to starting. It was supposed to start tomorrow. And we were very much looking forward to that because we continue to believe in the importance of New START.\n\nWe havent got havent received, excuse me, a real solid answer from the Russians as to why they postponed this. Were going to be working through the embassy to try to figure out what happened here. And wed like to see it get back on the schedule as soon as possible, because its important. Its not just important for our two nations. Its important for the rest of the world.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay, were going to go the back. The gentleman in the back. Go ahead.\n\nQ Thank you, Karine. Two questions, John. First, the niece of the Ayatollah Khamenei was arrested in Tehran recently as part of the protest mark. Does the administration, having stated its support for peaceful protests, have any particular statement about her arrest?\n\nMR. KIRBY: We would, I think, say stay very consistent, sir, that we believe in the right of peaceful protest. We have made it clear that we stand with particularly its largely Iranian women, but its obviously beyond that but particularly their concerns about the dictates that have affected their lives personally.\n\nAnd we will continue to do whatever we can to not only support their right of protest but to hold the regime accountable for the way its treating its people.\n\nQ And along the same lines, is the administration going to put out a statement to the military junta in Burma about the published reports of the incarceration and keeping incommunicado the former leader Aung San Suu Kyi?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont have a preview of some sort of statement to read out to you today. Weve been very clear about our concerns over over the militarys domination there and their practice and their policies, particularly the way they treat political prisoners. But I dont have a statement for you today about that particular issue.\n\nQ On China, John, is it the U.S.s assessment that these protests weve seen are widespread? Or are they perhaps more isolated incidents that are being amplified by social media?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont think that we know a whole lot more about the geographic location, size, scale, and scope of them than what youre learning as well through social media and through traditional media. Its not like we have, I think,\n\na finer sense of insight than whats already out there in the public sphere. So I you know, I dont I dont have a sense of that.\n\nQ In that realm, the statement you issued or that was\n\nissued earlier today didnt include any explicit calls for China to stop detaining and harming protesters and journalists. Why not?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Were watching this closely, as you might expect we would. And again, we continue to stand up and support the right of peaceful protest.\n\nAnd I think were going to watch this closely, and well see where things go.\n\nQ Can I ask you a quick one on Iran?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Sure.\n\nQ The U.S. Mens National Soccer Team\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah.\n\nhad thrown up an image of the old flag before them, including the Islamic Republic symbol.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Thats right.\n\nQ Was the does the White House have any comment on that decision?\n\nMR. KIRBY: No, actually, we dont. And this isnt the kind of thing that you would that the White House would comment on.\n\nUSA Soccer is a private entity, and they they make their own decisions about those kinds of things. And we wouldnt we wouldnt comment on that. We wish them all the best tomorrow.\n\nQ The team had said it was cons- it changed the flag after consultations with various entities afterward. Are you aware of anyone in the U.S. government speaking to the team about\n\nMR. KIRBY: I am not aware of any conversations by anybody in the U.S. government that had anything to do with their decision either to post that image previously and then to take it down and replace it, no.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: JJ.\n\nQ On China, again, John, is it the U.S.s is it the U.S.s assessment that theres any sort of risk to the U.S. economy or the U.S. supply chain because of the protests?\n\nMR. KIRBY: We dont see any particular impact right now to the supply chain as a result of these protests.\n\nQ And then, on the vaccines: Has the U.S. offered any U.S.-made vaccines coronavirus vaccines to China the mRNA vaccines?\n\nMR. KIRBY: We have not offered any to China at this time. As you know, we are the largest supplier of COVID vaccines around the world. And we have not received any requests or any interest by China to receive our vaccines.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Sebastian.\n\nQ Thank you very much. Thank you, John. Again, on China. You had just noted that youre watching this closely, as we might expect. Could you give us a sense of how much the President is engaging with this issue? Is he watching it personally, you know, getting updated more than on, maybe, some other things?\n\nMR. KIRBY: The President is staying briefed on whats going on inside China. Yes.\n\nQ Is it fair to say hes \"closely\" briefed on this?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Any time (laughter)\n\nQ Just just trying to get an impression of, like, where hes at with this issue.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Ive never been in the room where he wasnt, like, closely briefed. I mean, yeah, hes hes hes staying atop on whats whats going on. Hes monitoring this. We all are.\n\nSo, yes, the President is certainly staying mindful of the protest activity.\n\nQ Okay. Thank you.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Alex, way in the back.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. Thank you, John. You know, I sort of assume that the United States supports peaceful protest around the world. That, with all due respect, doesnt strike, I would think, most people as a novel position.\n\nThe question is\n\nMR. KIRBY: Well, Im glad that its not a novel position. Its exactly where we should be.\n\nQ But the President has explicitly drawn a contrast between autocracy and democracy here and also abroad. Isnt this a moment obviously, without getting into some sort of grand conflict to sort of assert the rights of people, advocating for freedom and democracy more forcefully than perhaps we have?\n\nMR. KIRBY: This is, I think, a moment to reassert what we believe in when it comes to free assembly and and peaceful protest. And weve done that and will continue to do that, whether its people protesting in Iran or China or anywhere else around the world.\n\nNothing has changed about the Presidents firm belief in the power of democracy and democratic institutions and how important that is. But this is really a moment to put it back into your words this is a moment for you know, for the for the Chinese people and the Chinese government to speak to.\n\nWe have been nothing but clear and consistent, and I think youll see that going forward.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Peter and then Mary.\n\nQ So, just to follow up, John: On the China issue, why is the White Houses line that \"everybody has the right to peacefully protest\" and not \"the U.S. thinks its bad to lock people up in their houses to stop COVID\"?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Weve weve made it clear, Peter, that a lockdown is not a policy that were going to support here. Weve weve come a long way over these last three years hard to believe three years in terms of treating COVID and preventing COVID.\n\nSo weve said, you know, a lockdown is not a policy that we support here. But, obviously, there are people in China that that have have concerns about that. And theyre protesting that, and we believe they should be able to do that peacefully.\n\nQ Okay. And on the sanctions relief for Venezuela\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah.\n\nQ why is it that President Biden would rather let U.S. companies drill for oil in Venezuela than here in the U.S.?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Thats not an accurate take on the Presidents view.\n\nQ Earlier this month, he said, \"No more drilling. There is no more drilling.\"\n\nMR. KIRBY: The President has issued 9,000 permits for drilling on U.S. federal lands, Peter; 9,000 of them are being unused. There are plenty of opportunities for oil and gas companies to drill here in the United States.\n\nNow, Ill let Chevron speak for this particular issue of sanctions relief, but our expectation is it wont be a lot of oil coming out of there. It will have to be shipped to the United States.\n\nQ Does the President think theres some benefit to the climate to drill oil in Venezuela and not here?\n\nMR. KIRBY: No, it has nothing to do with a benefit to the climate, Peter. Again, there are 9,000 unused permits here in the United States on federal land that oil and gas companies can and should take advantage of. Nine thousand. And were talking about one there in Venezuela.\n\nNow, look, it remains to be seen how much will get drilled down there. Itll be up to Chevron to decide that, Peter. But but as a function of the sanction itself, that oil, whatever product is drilled, has to come to the United States.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Mary.\n\nQ One more on China. How concerned is the President that Chinas zero-COVID strategy and that these restrictions may be inhibiting the economic recovery globally and here at home?\n\nMR. KIRBY: The President believes and hes said this many times I mean, COVID absolutely has had an impact on the global economy. Certainly, its had an impact on supply chains and resources around the world. And thats why the President wants to move the United States as quickly and as efficiently as we can through COVID so that so that even our economy can get more on track than it already is becoming now.\n\nSo, I mean, it is having a global effect. But what is also having a very acute, significant global impact on the economy is the war in Ukraine. And thats why were trying to go after a price cap on Russian oil. Thats why were trying to give Ukraine the tools and capabilities they need to succeed on the battlefield so this this war can end, can end in a way in which Ukraine can be whole and sovereign and free.\n\nSo theres a theres a lot of impacts on the global economy; its not just about COVID.\n\nQ But beyond just COVID generally, I mean, does he think that Chinas zero-COVID strategy that these restrictions are inhibiting the economic recovery?\n\nMR. KIRBY: The President recognizes that in many countries around the world, COVID is still an issue. And certainly, to the degree that it inhibits a countrys ability to conduct commerce, its having an impact on the world. And China is a huge economic competitor out there.\n\nBut I wouldnt get into parsing the dollar-figure effect here of the remaining challenge of COVID in China. But clearly, China as a major economic player and China still struggling with COVID, theres obviously theres an impact on the economy.\n\nQ And just one more. On Paul Whelan, his brother said he missed a scheduled phone call home to his family on Thursday, which they say is incredibly unusual for him to miss a call, especially on a holiday like that. How concerned are you about this silence? Have you received any information on his condition? And just, can you give us any update on any progress that may or may not have been made?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im afraid I dont have an update for you. This is the first Ive heard that there was a phone call that was missed. So why dont you let me take that back and see if we can find out something for you? I dont want to just speculate up here.\n\nObviously, were deeply concerned about him and and Brittney Griner and all Americans wrongfully detained overseas. But let me take that question.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All done, Mary? Okay. Go ahead, Phil.\n\nQ Thank you. Two quick questions. One on China and then on Ukraine. Im wondering, what is the Presidents reaction when he hears protesters in China chant \"freedom\" or \"Xi Jinping step down\"?\n\nMR. KIRBY: The President is not going to speak for protesters around the world; theyre speaking for themselves.\n\nQ And so theres no reaction?\n\nMR. KIRBY: These protesters are speaking for themselves. What we are doing is making it clear that we support the right of peaceful protest.\n\nQ And then, my follow-up: Is the backlog of arms shipments to Taiwan a result of our stepped-up efforts to send arms to Ukraine?\n\nMR. KIRBY: What I can tell you is that we are constantly balancing, as we must, our own inventories, the inventories of our allies and partners and people that we do conduct arm sales with, as well as, of course, the inventory that the Ukrainian armed forces need to fight the Russian aggression.\n\nAnd its a balancing act. And with every single decision by the President to draw down DOD stocks, you know, he gets an assessment from the Pentagon about whether thats going to affect our readiness. And were in constant touch with, again, allies and partners about their readiness needs, because many of them are reliant on U.S. systems. And of course, you know, that includes Taiwan.\n\nWe just the President just signed out what, a month or so ago? another billion dollars of Taiwan arm sales. And of course, were going to continue to look at what the next iteration of that needs to look like and when that would occur. But we take very seriously our responsibility to help provide Taiwan the self-defense capabilities that that it needs. Thats in accordance with law and policy, and thats not going to change.\n\nQ But in terms of those shipments actually going out the door to Taiwan currently, is there a backlog when it comes to those arms being shipped?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Im not going to get into it at a public podium, talking about inventory stocks of any system anywhere. That just is not a good idea for for us to do. Certainly not from the podium.\n\nWe we watch it very closely. We make sure that our readiness can be preserved, as well as the readiness of our allies and partners.\n\nBut look, has has all the provisions to Ukraine has that has that caused an effort inside the administration to make sure that we are that we are judiciously monitoring stocks and inventories, and working with the defense industry to plus them up and to make sure that those supply chains are still flowing? Absolutely. They of course of course we are. But its a balance we strike every day.\n\nQ Thank you, sir.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, way in the back there.\n\nQ Thanks. John, regarding Turkey, many are skeptical regarding the Turkish claims that the PKK was behind the explosion in Istanbul. And now they are using this as a justification for a ground operation in Syria.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah.\n\nQ Did the U.S. ask for evidence, or did you offer help for the investigation? Do you see this as a proper justification for a ground operation in Syria?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I dont believe weve were offered anything to help with the investigation. And were not in a position to to say specifically who was responsible. We condemned the violence at the time. We condemn it today.\n\nAnd as Ive said as recently as a week or so ago, we do need to remember that Turkey continues to be to fall victim to terrorist attacks, whether its near that border or elsewhere inside the country. And they have a right to to defend themselves and their citizens against attacks.\n\nNow, what weve said additionally is that we want to see the tensions de-escalate here. And we dont want to see any actions that, A, lead to the potential of additional casualties, particularly civilian casualties. And, B, do anything that would harm our efforts to continue to work with our Syrian counterparts against ISIS, which remains a viable, credible threat inside Iraq and Syria, and we got to keep the pressure on them.\n\nQ But is this a greenlight for Erdoan to go inside Syria when you say they they have the right to defend themselves?\n\nMR. KIRBY: They do have the right to defend themselves. They had they have they have suffered terrorist attacks.\n\nBut we dont want to see actions, particularly inside Syria, that are going to lead to a potential for more casualties, more loss of innocent life, and any diminution of our efforts distraction away from our efforts, because we have troops in Syria that to go after to ISIS.\n\nThe other thing I would Id mentioned is we also dont want to see any actions inside Syria, by Turkey or anyone else, that could put American lives at risk, because there are Americans on the ground, and theyre helping the SDF.\n\nQ Thanks, John. There were some concrete steps moving the relationship forward, in terms of a bilateral basis, after the meeting between President Biden and Xi.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Right.\n\nQ Is there any concern or will that those steps have any effect on how the U.S. responds to any Chinese response to the protests that are currently ongoing?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I think were going to have to watch this going forward, Phil. What I can tell you is: As you and I are talking today, theres theres been no change to our desire to continue to see these channels of communication stay open. And we were heartened coming away from the G20 that both leaders were able to agree on getting some of these working-level discussions back open.\n\nAnd so, were still in that mode, Phil, where we want to continue to get those get those discussions back up in play.\n\nAnd as for whether or not therell be an impact from the protests, were just going to have to I think were just as I said, were going to watch this and see where it goes.\n\nQ One more quick one. Apologies, Karine. Were kind of in crunch time for the price cap you mentioned a few minutes ago.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah.\n\nQ Is there a sense inside the White House right now that the President or the team will need to have more of a public posture in terms of trying to get this across the finish line? I know its kind of an EU-level issue right now, but\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah, I dont think Phil, I dont think were at that point right now where we feel theres some sort of inordinate pressure to to be more public about it than we already have been. I think weve been very public about it. Or that, you know you know, we need to smash down on the accelerator here.\n\nThe discussions are going well, we think. And we strongly believe that a price cap is a good approach, the right approach to limit Mr. Putins ability to profiteer off this war. And our EU colleagues are working through the modalities of it right now: how that would be implemented, what level its going to be at.\n\nWe think those discussions are going on in a pretty robust fashion, so I dont think we believe theres a pressure on us right now to get more involved than we already are.\n\nQ Thanks, John.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Steve.\n\nQ Thanks. John, I want to try to get your response to a letter that was sent by the leadership of five news organizations to the administration.\n\nOne of those news organizations is the New York Times. These organizations worked with Julian Assange prior to the publication of classified cables by WikiLeaks, and theyre asking that the administration drop the Espionage Act charge that was put forward against Assange by the Trump administration.\n\nGenerally, whats the White Houses response to that request? And Ill start there, and then Ill ask you a follow-up.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah, were aware of it, and we would refer you to the Justice Department\n\nQ All right, I anticipated that answer. What is your assessment or what is the National Security Councils assessment of the harm that was done by the WikiLeaks leak in 2012? That would inform any decision by the Justice Department.\n\nMR. KIRBY: I think, you know, we if you go back and look at how the administration responded in 2012 and, of course, President Biden was then Vice President at the time we would we would maintain that we that what what we said at the time what was said at the time, that those that those leaks, those revelations in the public sphere were damaging to U.S. national security.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Inaudible.)\n\nQ Yeah, I just wanted to ask: The head of NATO is warning that, essentially, Vladimir Putin is using winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine. What specifically is the United States doing in conjunction with its partners and allies to counter that, given the continued attacks on the energy grid?\n\nMR. KIRBY: So, youre referring to the his targeting of civilian infrastructure? Yeah.\n\nSo, I mean, this is a guy whos used food as a weapon. Hes used fear as a weapon. He and as as our as the Secretary-General of NATO said, now hes using the coming cold weather here to basically try to bring the Ukrainian people to their knees.\n\nWhen you take a look at what hes hitting, its almost all civilian infrastructure. And its largely as you pointed out its energy, its water, its the kind of resources that people need as they get ready to brace for what will no doubt be a cold winter.\n\nAnd so, what were doing is a couple of things. First of all, were still going to continue to provide the Ukrainian armed forces with the tools, weapons, the capabilities, the training that they need so that they can be successful on the battlefield. And they have been very successful in just the last few weeks.\n\nSecondly, were working with allies and partners around the world and certainly working inside the various agencies of this administration to get spare parts, equipment, transformers, the kinds of material theyll need to get some of these systems and networks back up and running and get the power turned back on in much of Ukraine as well as, of course, water resources. So, were working on that very, very hard again, with allies and partners.\n\nIts some of the material will no doubt come from the United States. But we also recognize that their grid is based on infrastructure that is uniquely European. And so, were going to were working with, again, allies and partners in the region as well to see what they can do to get to get more in there to keep the lights on and the water running.\n\nBut its despicable. Its absolutely despicable what he is doing in these last few weeks. Not that he hasnt been despicable before, but you you hit exactly on the issue, that these targets are largely civilian. And its designed to want for one reason, and thats to try to bring the Ukrainian people to their knees, because he cant bring the Ukrainian armed forces to its knees.\n\nAnd you would think that now going into, I guess its eight months now, which is hard to believe actually going into our ninth month here that he would have learned he, Putin, would have learned a while ago that you just cant bring the Ukrainian people to their knees.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Two more. Go ahead.\n\nQ Kim Jong Un says he is trying to build the most powerful nuclear force. Do you expect the North Koreans to conduct a nuclear test in the near future?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Weve said that we believe Kim could conduct a nuclear test at any time.\n\nQ Okay. One more. His daughter made a public appearance twice this month. What do you think about her appearance? Why suddenly now?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I certainly cant speak to the parenting skills of Kim Jong Un. Im afraid I dont have anything for you there. (Laughter.)\n\nLook, in all seriousness, the man continues to advance military capabilities that continue to destabilize the region not just the Peninsula but the region. And were taking this seriously, which is why were improving our intelligence capabilities there, collection capabilities in the region.\n\nIts why were working so hard with Japan and South Korea bilaterally and trilaterally. The President had a chance to meet with both leaders while we were at the G20 to advance our own defense capabilities and our own defense needs.\n\nPeople sometimes forget and Ive said it a lot; you guys probably roll your eyes when I say this because Ive said it before, but five of our seven treaty alliances, because since we since we started the briefing talking about alliances five of seven are in the Indo-Pacific, and we take them seriously because they put on us very significant security commitments to help with the defense of Japan and South Korea, respectively, in this case. And we take that seriously, which means we got to make sure were ready for the kinds of capabilities that he clearly is so interested in continuing to pursue.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Gerren. And then, Monica, youll have the last question.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. Thanks, John. There have been reports about the penal colony that Brittney Griner is being held, indicating that she potentially is exposed to forced labor and homophobia and racism. Is there any update about her physical and mental health?\n\nAnd I know CIA Director Burns did meet with his counterpart in Russia. Are there any plans to have another meeting between officials, between U.S. and Russia, to specifically discuss this ongoing negotiation to get her home?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Great questions, both of them. On the on the second one, we continue to have ongoing conversations with Russian officials about Brittneys release, as well as Mr. Whelans, in trying to get them home to their families where they belong. I can assure you that those conversations are ongoing, and we want them both home as fast as possible, and this administration is going to stay committed to that task.\n\nOn her condition, I think you can understand, for for privacy reasons, Im not going to get into much detail about her physical health. I wouldnt do that. I can just tell you that were taking that very seriously as well, knowing where she is and what penal colonies are designed to do. And were making were trying to make sure we have as much access and information about her condition as possible. Sometimes thats done more through her representatives than it is from our diplomatic presence just because of the modalities of it. But were doing the best we can to stay on top of it as much as we can.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Monica, last question.\n\nQ John, can you share any update on whether President Biden will accept the invitation of Mexican President Lpez Obrador to attend the \"Three Amigos\" summit in Mexico City? I know that had been talked about as potentially scheduled for December. It now may be pushed back to January. Is there anything you can share on that?\n\nMR. KIRBY: The North American Leaders Summit? Yeah. The President is looking forward to being able to have to have that meeting. But we dont have a date yet or anything to say on the schedule. Nothing to confirm on the schedule right now. But hes looking forward to the discussion, absolutely.\n\nAll right.\n\nQ Thanks, John.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Thanks, guys. Happy late Thanksgiving to\n\nyou.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thanks, John.\n\nOkay, before we dive into questions, just, I have a couple things a few updates at the top to share with all of you.\n\nAs you know, President Biden committed to doing everything within his power to address Putins price hike at the pump.\n\nToday, gas prices have returned to the levels they were prior to Putins invasion of Ukraine. As the chart behind me shows, the national average is $3.55 per gallon down over $1.45 per gallon from the June peak. The most common price is $2.99 per gallon. Thats saving American families with two cars about $160 per month, on average.\n\nThis is important breathing room for American families and meets a key commitment that the President made to them. So, its no accident either on a couple of things. President Biden has been releasing oil from the reserve, as you know, which was a historic action that this President took. He called on international partners to release oil as well. And hes been calling on oil and gas companies to pass on their savings to consumers at the pump. The Presidents actions have helped bring prices down for families, and he will continue to do everything possible to bring prices down even further.\n\nEarlier today, the President signed a Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence to strengthen the U.S. governments effort to combat rape as a weapon of war.\n\nThis Presidential Memorandum directs the State Department, Treasury Department, and other federal agency to leverage sanctions authorities, assistance restrictions, and other tools to promote accountability for perpetrators of conflict-related sexual violence.\n\nWith this executive action, U.S. departments and agency are for the first time ever being directed to ensure equal consideration of acts of conflict-related sexual violence when identifying targets and preparing designations for potential sanctions.\n\nUnder President Bidens leadership, the United States will continue leading efforts to rally other nations and international organizations to prevent and promote accountability for acts of conflict-related sexual violence.\n\nTodays action is part of the Presidents broader commitment to work to address all forms of gender-based violence.\n\nNow, finally, today, President Biden met with three U.S. winners of the 2022 Nobel Prize: Dr. Carolyn Bertozzi, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry; Dr. John Clauser, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics; and Dr. Douglas Diamond, who won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.\n\nThe President is restarting an important tradition that just like just like he does for winning sports teams, as you have seen him do in the past 20 months or so, the President meets with U.S. winners of the Nobel Prize.\n\nTheir achievements show how taking on the biggest questions can establish new fields of inquiry, promote technology, innovation, and expand the boundaries of what is possible. Their work is a reminder of why the President often says that the America can be defined by one word, and you all know that word that he uses is \"possibilities.\"\n\nWith that, Im going to go out of school for a second. And I know theres a young reporter in the room who would like to ask a question. Eva? Eva Shapiro?\n\nQ Shapiro.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Sha- oh, pardon me. And where are you from? What\n\nQ Austin, Texas.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Austin, Texas. And you are part of the Kids Scoop\n\nQ KidScoop Media.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Well, welcome to the briefing room. Its great to have you. And you could youre going to trump AP. And (laughs) Ill take your first question.\n\nQ Given the situation in Iran with protesting, what are we going to do or what can we do to help?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, thats an excellent question and an important question to ask. And we have answered this question multiple times here at the at this podium, and the President spoke to this when he was in the in the halls of the United Nations not too long ago in September. And he said, \"We stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.\" End quote.\n\nTheres a lot that we can do and a lot that we are doing to support those brave citizens, again, of Iran those brave protesters. Were taking steps both on our own, as the United States, and also in partnership with other countries just around the world, and including organizations like the United Nations, as I mentioned, when the President first made his comments about what we were seeing in Iran from the civilians.\n\nBut let me just give you a couple of examples. Were using economic tools like sanctions against Iranian officials. We supported the U.N. Human Rights Councils vote to create a fact-finding mission to investigate human rights abuses in Iran, which which was really historic, something that we had not seen.\n\nSo, were working with civil society organizations to make sure Iran is removed from a United Nations body focused on women, called the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women. We have expressed support for the Joint Statement by Women Foreign Ministers on Iran. And were speaking out over and over again, and raising awareness and making sure that those brave women and citizens are lifted up as they are really fighting for their basic rights.\n\nBut thank you so much for your question. I really appreciate you. And again, welcome welcome to the briefing room. Hopefully you come back.\n\nAll right. Go ahead.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. And welcome to the briefing room. On two and a half weeks ago, when the President held his press conference after the midterm results, he said hed be inviting congressional leadership of both parties over to the White House after his trip to the G20. Were a week-plus since hes been back. Has that invite gone out? And when is that meeting going to take place?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, as you know, Congress has just returned, so the President is looking forward to talking to, speaking with to Democratic and Republican leadership. I dont have anything to preview for you at this time on a date on when that will happen. But he is this is something that he is indeed looking forward to, and we will make that happen as soon as we can.\n\nQ Today is this deadline for counties to certify election results in a number of states, including Arizona, where at least one county has refused to certify the results of the midterm elections from a couple weeks ago, citing the conduct of the election in another county, in Maricopa County. Does the White House is the White House monitoring, sort of, state-level and local- and county-level efforts to, sort of, overturn election results or not certify election results? And does the President have any response?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, the very good question. I dont have anything to share on if were monitoring anything specific or in particular. Im sure thats something the DNC is doing, and other committees are clearly focusing on on those particulars very closely.\n\nLook\n\nQ (Inaudible.)\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. No, but I weve been very clear on the sacred right to vote and how you know, and how its important that the American people feel like their vote will be counted.\n\nAnd that and he has denounced the election deniers that we have heard from on the other side, and he has called that out, and he has every confidence in our electoral system.\n\nQ And then, just lastly, we know those rail negotiations are seem to be nearing impasse. Theres a report in the Washington Post that the President plans to ask Congress to step in and either extend the cooling-off period for talks or take some other measures to try to prevent a potentially devastating shutdown of the rail system in the next couple of weeks.\n\nDoes can you confirm that the President does plan to ask Congress to step in and take action here?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I dont have anything right now at this time to announce or preview on any announcement that the President is going to make. Once he is ready to make that announcement, certainly, he we will let you know or make an announcement of any kind related to this, we will clearly share that with all of you.\n\nI do want to say a couple of things, which is really important as we look at whats currently happening. Look, from the beginning, the President has been very clear: A shutdown is unacceptable because of the impact that it would have on jobs and families and farms and businesses and communities just across the country.\n\nThe President is directly involved in the process and has been engaged with his team and also has had conversation with members of Congress on this particular issue in case in case resolving the issue in case resolving the issue falls to them, as it has 18 times in the last 60 years, as you know. I know you guys are following this closely.\n\nAnd in addition in addition to the Presidents involvement, Secretary Walsh has been in contact with rail workers, the unions there. He has been in direct connection contact with them. Secretary Buttigieg has been in contact with rail companies. And Secretary Vilsack has engaged agriculture and industry stakeholders as well.\n\nSo, this has been very much not just the President but, clearly, the three Secretaries that I just mentioned in his administration.\n\nA majority of unions, as you all know, have voted to ratify the the temporary agreement. Thats 8 out of 12. There are 12 unions involved. And the best option that we believe, that the President believes, is still for the parties to resolve these themselves, res- resolve this themselves and to do this, really, in short order.\n\nQ Members of the Democratic National Committee are meeting here in Washington later this week to talk about the potential calendar for the partys presidential nomination process in 2024. Theyre doing this, in essence, at the behest of the President, who has signaled that hes not a huge fan of Iowa going first, given the lack of diversity in that state.\n\nCan you say whether he intends to weigh in on this issue as or before they meet, or if he indeed believes that Iowa should lose its first-in-the-nation status?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, this is not something that Im going to speak to from here. This is something that the Democratic National Committee, as you know, is that committee that youre speaking of is out of the DNC. And so, I would refer you to them specifically.\n\nI dont have anything else to preview or to share about any comments or statements that the President may make on this particular issue.\n\nBut again, from here, Im not going to comment from on this. I would refer you to the to the DNC.\n\nQ Are there any plans for the President to go to Georgia in the final days of the Senate runoff?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, Ive been asked this question before about what the President is could potentially be doing for the Georgia runoff. I have to be careful because it is an existing existing race that is happening. And so, I cannot I am covered by the Hatch Act, so I cant speak specifically to this.\n\nBut what I can say, and Ive said this before: The President is willing to do whatever is needed of him by Senator Warnock. I dont have anything else to preview from here.\n\nQ So does that mean that the ask hasnt been made from Senator Warnock (inaudible)?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I really I just I dont want to dive into request or asks. Thats something that we didnt do during the midterms the past several months. Were certainly not going to start now.\n\nWhat I can say: I dont have anything to preview for you at this time or to announce. But again, the President is willing to do whatever is asked of him.\n\nQ The Boston Globe is reporting that the President is going to be in Boston on Friday for a fundraiser. Can you confirm that trip? And then, also, they note that that day the Royals will be in Boston as well for the Earthshot Prize. Is there potentially going to be an overlap or meeting? Or will the President\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I heard about that. This is the the Prince of Wales is going to be so (laughter) I dont have anything to share on the Presidents travels for any traveling announcement to make for Friday or any any future date after tomorrow. As you all know, hell be going to Michigan.\n\nOnce we have something to share, certainly, we will share that. And as far as the the Royals being in town, I dont have anything to preview as well.\n\nQ Finally, the President said he did a part of his annual physical while he was talking about answering a question about this specifically in Nantucket. And he said he would do the rest before the end of the year. What did he mean by that? And then will be he be going to Walter Reed, as he did last year in the next couple of weeks?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So thats a good question. I havent I actually have not talked to him about that. I remember him saying that over the weekend.\n\nLook, I was asked this question just at the last briefing. You know, the President is in good health and maintains an active lifestyle. You see him on a almost on a regular basis yourselves. And you can see he always says, \"Watch me.\"\n\nHe will have a physical in the upcoming months. And the results will be, certainly, released, as the same way as it was last year, in a very transparent way. And we will be sharing with that with all of you as soon as as soon as we have it.\n\nGo ahead, Steven.\n\nQ Thanks. Just to go back to the rail labor dispute. What would drive the President to seek a congressional resolution here?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, Im not going to legislate from here. What I can say is we have been in regular communication with Congress for the past several months. But certainly not going to legislate or or lay out the process from here.\n\nQ Let me ask you this: In 1992, the last time Congress intervened to prevent a labor rail shutdown, Joe Biden was one of six senators, and only six, to say that the Congress should not intervene, that its a dynamic that favors the railroads against the interests of the workers. Why would he seek congressional intervention now?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, again, I cant Im when the President has made a decision on this, if he makes a decision on this, youll hear directly from him. Dont have anything to share or preview at this time.\n\nAs I mentioned moments ago, the President has been in regular contact with members of Congress. He has been directly involved in having those conversations, directly involved with his administration. I laid out what Secretary Walsh is doing, what Secretary Buttigieg and Secretary Vilsack\n\nThis is something that has been a priority for this President and this administration for the past several months. Majority as I just laid out, also, moments ago of unions have ratified the tentative agreement.\n\nAgain, Im not going to legislate from here, not going to get into get ahead of any potential announcement. But as you stated, in cases like this, issues falls to Congress. And it has done this 18 times in the last 60 years.\n\nSo, again, its not unusual, but Im just not going to get into a hypothetical from here at this time.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ A couple questions about the lame duck agenda. The President said last week that he was going to try to ban assault weapons during the session. What does that look like? Is he making calls? Is he taking meetings on this? Has he tasked the team with working on this? And does he think that 60 votes are actually possible here, thats within reach somehow?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So Im so glad you asked the question, Mary, because this morning, when I was in the Oval Office in a meeting with the President, he actually brought this up himself, because he knows how his comments were reported over the weekend. And he wanted to be very clear, and he said that, you know, he believes that its important to keep this issue in banning assault weapons at the front of minds of Americans.\n\nHe believes that it is it is it is also up to him, as President of the United States, to make the case for why it is critical to move forward with assault assault weapons ban.\n\nAnd so he he look, he understands whats at stake. He wants the American people to continue to understand whats at stake. We know many communities have felt this very deeply, very personally.\n\nAnd he also believes you know, there were families this past this past Thanksgiving holiday who looked around their table and they were missing members of their family because of this gun violence, this horrific gun violence that we have seen as recently as this weekend, as recently as just last week. And he believes that they deserve they deserve to for us, for him, to continue to talk about this, continue to put this out there about the importance of getting this done for American communities.\n\nBut again, look, we understand its an uphill battle. We understand that this is not easy. He gets that. But it doesnt mean that hes going to stop fighting for it or that hes going to stop talking about it.\n\nQ And on one other issue, raising the debt ceiling: Weve seen Republicans who have threatened to use this as leverage to get some of their agenda items through. How much importance does the President placed on raising the debt ceiling during a lame duck session?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, you know, weve been clear about this: When it comes to the debt ceiling, it should not it should not be used or never be a matter of political brinksmanship. Weve been very clear about that.\n\nAnd congr- you know, congressional Republicans, they passed this with the last President three times the former President. They they passed to lift the debt ceiling three times. Theres no reason why this should not be happening this time around.\n\nThe Congress, you know, needs to take the responsibility, once again, to address the debt ceiling before it expires. And they need to act sooner rather than later.\n\nLook, now that Congress is back, we believe that, you know, there will be more of an urgency to get this done.\n\nAnd look, this is this is about, you know, the sooner they act you know, this is about our economy. This will be better for our economy. So were have those conversation.\n\nThe President, as I was asked moments ago, is going to meet with leadership from both the Hou- from both the House and the Senate, the Democratic and Republican leadership. And certainly well be having these conversations.\n\nQ You just laid out for us the gas price that prices are back down to levels before the war. Housing prices, on the other hand, are not coming down nearly fast enough. Given the split Congress you know, weve talked about some of the difficulty of the lame-duck session I mean, have you run out of options in terms of pressing down housing prices? And what can you do to help people there, especially if the student debt issue doesnt, you know, go your way?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, we are as the President said, to your to your last statement about the student debt relief, his relief plan hes optimistic. Hes an optimistic person. Hes going to continue to fight for a plan thats going to help close to 40 million Americans across the country. And lets not forget 90 percent of them are making less than $75,000 a year. That matters. That is a plan that is going to give people a little bit of breathing room.\n\nSo we are we are confident in our in our in our legal standing, if you will. As you know, its up its up to the Supreme Court, and were going to continue to fight. That will not end.\n\nBut to your question: Look, affor- housing affordability is a central challenge for families; we know that as you just laid that out, Andrea. And thats due to longstanding shortfall of affordable housing, plus increased demand for homes during the pandemic and a reduced number of homes due to previous supply chain challenges.\n\nSo the good news is this: that we are starting to see the housing market cool by a range of measures just a bit. Several data sources now show that rent falling are or rent growth easing in recent months, which should mean lower shelter inflation on months ahead.\n\nAnd but we understand, and we get it. As I just said, its a central issue for many families and many Americans. Theres more work to do. And we will continue to to use all of the administrative tools to make sure that we give we continue to give families some relief.\n\nQ Just a question about Twitter. You know, theres a researcher at Stanford who says that this is a critical moment, really, in terms of ensuring that Twitter does not become a vector for misinformation. I mean, are you concerned about the you know, Elon Musk says theres more and more subscribers coming online. Are you concerned about that? And what tools do you have? Who is it at the White House that is really keeping track of this?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, this is something that were certainly keeping an eye on. And, look, we you know, we have always been very clear and that when it comes to social media platforms, it is their responsibility to make sure that when it comes to misinformation, when we when it comes to the hate that were seeing, that they take action, that they continue to take action.\n\nAgain, were all keeping a close eye on this. Were all monitoring whats whats currently occurring. And we see you know, we see it with our own eyes of what you all are reporting and, just for ourselves, whats happening on Twitter.\n\nBut again, social media companies have a responsibility to prevent their platforms from being used by any user to incite violence, especially violence directed at individual communities, as we have been seeing. And the President has been very clear on calling that out. Hell continue to do that. And were going to continue to monitor the situation.\n\nGo ahead, Phil.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. I dont think the President has spoken to the House Republican leader since the day after the election, even though the House was called for Republicans a few days later. Does that have anything to do with the fact that he may not actually be Speaker of the House next Congress? Or how are you guys kind of working through that?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, no, I that I mean, Congress has been out. Theyre just coming back in.\n\nLook, the President has been really clear, and hes underscored this many times, that hes here to find common ground and work across the aisle. That is something that he has done while hes been President here the CHIPS and Science Act, as you you all know. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is something that hes been hes done as well. And he has signed into law more than 200 pieces of legislation that were bipartisan.\n\nSo, look, hes looking forward to having those conversations with congressional Republicans. And and what his focus is, and hes been very clear about this, is delivering for the American people, continuing to give them that little bit of breathing room.\n\nAnd once we have that meeting set, we certainly will share that.\n\nQ And then, when it comes to the lame-duck, you talk about the bipartisanship idea. Hes going to need at least 10 Republicans on a government spending package if an omnibus is going to move forward. Has he been given any signals by Senate Republican leadership that there will be 10 Republicans for an overarching full fiscal year deal?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, when it comes to the government funding, you know, our efforts to secure the needed government funding are in good hands with our OMB Director Shalanda Young. She is not new to this. As you know, she did we we we were able to get this done in a bipartisan fashion just last year, and so she knows how to reach across the aisle. And so we are confident that we will get this done.\n\nAnd, you know, we have been our Office of Leg Affairs, the office office at OMB, as well, has been in has had multiple calls with congressional members and staffers and also have done briefings about how important it is in reaching an agreement a full-year appropriations agreement and the dangers of passing the buck yet again.\n\nAnd not only that I think you all saw, just last night, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Austin, put out a letter he wrote to Congress, and he said he said he warned that a continuing resolution of any length would \"result in significant harm\" to the American people, military programs, and our national security, and our competitiveness.\n\nWe have to remember the programs that were talking about are not partisan programs; they are programs thats going to help American families. Were talking about education. Were talking, as I just mentioned, as the Secretary said, our national security. You know, were talking about things that really, truly matter to the American people: education, cutting-edge technology. All of these things are not are not partisan issues. And so we should be able to get this done in a bipartisan way just like we did last year.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. You mentioned earlier about how passing an assault weapons ban would be an uphill battle, especially given the breakdown in Congress. I wonder if there are other things the President is considering, whether its executive authority or calling on state governors to take action at the state level. What are some of the other things that are that the President is considering?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, so let me just first state I get your question, but let me just first state a couple of things. Number one, this President has taken more executive action in his first first year and a half on dealing with gun violence than any other President. And that shows his commitment in what he has been able to do and wanting to make sure to protect our communities. And so I just want to be very clear on that.\n\nAnd lets not forget, just a couple of months ago, there was a bipartisan legislation on protecting our communities to really deal with the effects of gun violence. And so that is something that happened. That was the first time we were able to see that type of legislation in 30 years.\n\nSo, again, I have said this: The President is an optimist, but he also understands that it is he sees it as his responsibility to continue to make the case. I dont have anything else to preview as to any additional executive action that will be taken from here.\n\nBut again, we have seen action on this during his presidency that we hadnt seen in 30 years.\n\nQ I got another question about tomorrow. The President is going to Michigan. Do you have a preview on what he plans to say and sort of what that portends for his future travel during the lame duck and into the new Congress?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, I actually do. I have something to share for you all to preview.\n\nSo, as you just mentioned, the President is going to be going to Michigan, specifically Bay City, Michigan, to discuss the American manufacturing boom.\n\nThanks to his economic strategy, the President will visit a ma- a new manufacturing facility recently opened by SK siltron, which last year announced a $300 million expansion of its Michigan operations.\n\nDuring his remarks, President Biden will highlight his economic plan is leading to a manufacturing boom, growing the economy, and creating good-paying jobs in Michigan and also just across the country as well.\n\nAs you all know, the economy has created more than 700,000 manufacturing jobs. And that is 10 million total jobs created under this President in his first almost two years here in in the White House.\n\nHe will also discuss Democrats success in the midterm elections in Michigan, thanks to our efforts to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out to protect democracy, as youve heard the President speak to, and to protect womens reproductive healthcare, which is something that the President and the Vice President is committed to doing.\n\nI would expect more coming from us this evening. We usually do a background call or have some information out there for you all to just lay out exactly what you can expect from from the trip.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ On the rail issue again, you know, when this was the tentative agreement was announced a few months back, it sort of let it was after what? an hours-long overnight meeting with all of the parties involved, with the Labor Secretary.\n\nHave the talks reached that level of intensity, that level of engagement with the administration? And if not, is that a strategy we would see employed again, essentially putting all of the parties in a room overnight, however long it takes, and nobody leaves us until theres a deal?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, totally appreciate the question. Look, the President has been very clear: A shutdown will be unacceptable.\n\nAs I mentioned, Secretary Walsh has been in direct contact with the unions the rail unions. Secretary Buttigieg has been in touch with the rail companies. And and Secretary Vilsack has been in touch with the agricultural sector. So, we have been in regular touch with folks, and were continuing to do that.\n\nThe President has had multiple conversations, has been directly involved with his administration and also members of Congress.\n\nAnd so, what we believe and what we will continue to say is that we think and what should be happening in good faith is that they should come up with a solution. And majority of the unions have ratified this. You have 8 out of the 12, which is important to also note.\n\nBut again, this is Im just not going to get into any details on what else we can other efforts that\n\nwe might be taking.\n\nQ So theres no meeting, like, thats been planned or set with every every representative?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I dont have I dont have anything to preview about convening everyone here all at once. But it matters. It matters that Secretary Walsh has been in direct contact with the rail workers. It matters that Secretary Buttigieg has been in touch with the companies. And it matters, for certain, that Secretary Vilsack has been in touch with Ag the agricultural sector. And thats going to continue. Those conversations will continue to happen.\n\nAgain, the President has been very clear: A shutdown is unacceptable. It will hurt families, communities across the country. It will hurt jobs, it will hurt farms, it will hurt businesses, and it should not be happening.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ One question. The U.S. Embassy to the Dominican Republic issued a warning to U.S. citizens about those traveling to D.R. that those that are dark skinned were being targeted. This as Dominican Republic is dealing with more deportations of Haitians.\n\nAnd so, my question is: Is there anything that any response or actions from the administration in light of this warning thats come out?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, when it comes to the warnings, that comes from the Secretary of State, so I would refer you to them on the specifics and the particulars of that of that warning and would just let them speak to it themselves.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up. The President has said repeatedly that of course he wants to ban assault weapons. But on Thanksgiving, when he was in Nantucket, he said, quote, \"The idea we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick.\"\n\nObviously, thats a huge category of guns, from rifles to pistols to shotguns, that are not assault weapons. So, I guess my question here is: Did the President misspeak or does he, in fact, want to ban all semi-automatic guns?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, he was he was talking about assault weapons. Thats what he was talking about on that on that morning or that afternoon when he was asked that question.\n\nQ Thank you.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. Great. Go ahead.\n\nQ As you know, former President Donald Trump had a dinner with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes, a known white nationalist. Does is the White House concerned that former President and, more importantly, a current candidate for President is meeting with someone who is known to foster racist and antisemitic views?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, Im not going to respond to everything that happens with the former President. But this this is something thats important that we speak very clear about and we speak very very forcefully about.\n\nThis administration, this President totally rejects bigotry, racism, antisemitism. And there is just no place for these types of vile forces in our society. And this is something that we are going to continue to deny, including Holocaust deniers.\n\nAnd lets not forget, when you say things like this, when you when you do not speak out against these type of poisonous and dangerous kind of remarks or representation, if you will, that is that is also incredibly dangerous within itself.\n\nAnd so, we need to we should all be condemning this, and we should be very clear very clear and say it in really absolute, clear terms. And again, this is something that we condemn and we will continue to speak out against.\n\nQ A quick one on the World Cup. So, just while we were sitting here, a man with a carrying a rainbow flag and wearing a T-shirt saying \"Free\" oh, no, rather, \"Respect for Iranian Women\" ran across the pitch and, you know, was then taken away.\n\nSo, first of all, is the President going to be I know hes traveling tomorrow and hes got to give a speech and so on, but its right around the time of the big game. Is he going to be is he going to be, basically, kept abreast of, you know, how thats going?\n\nAnd just on the political side, what does he feel about the rights of people to do things like what this man did just now wave a wave an LGBT flag and call out for Iranian women?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, just more broadly, and, you know, well well say this: Look, we we urge the State of Qatar and all Qataris to fully realize the Amirs message here. And that that is to truly recognize and welcome everyone to the cup to the World Cup.\n\nAnd weve been very clear about that. Weve said that many times before. We are concerned of over the potential treatment of LGBTQ+ spectators and athletes. And and, you know, this is something that the President will call out: any type of human rights abuses. He is he is not shy and has been very clear raising these issues. And hell continue to do that.\n\nAnd look, when it comes to the game tomorrow, clearly the President will be kept kept abreast of how that particular game is going. But, as you know, we will be going well be traveling to Michigan tomorrow.\n\nQ Thank you, Karine.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Thanks, everybody.\n\n4:00 P.M. EST",

Credit Credit... Pawel Supernak/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\nPolands president said on Wednesday that a Ukrainian air defense missile had most likely caused a deadly explosion in his country a day earlier, calling it an \"unfortunate accident\" and easing fears that his country and its NATO allies could be drawn into a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nPresident Andrzej Duda said early indications suggested that Ukrainian efforts to counter a barrage of roughly 100 Russian missiles had been the cause of the blast on Tuesday that killed two farm workers not a direct attack on his country.\n\n\"We have no evidence at the moment that it was a rocket launched by Russian forces,\" Mr. Duda told reporters. \"However, there are many indications that it was a missile that was used by Ukraines antimissile defense.\"\n\nJens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said after meeting with the alliances envoys that a preliminary analysis also suggested that a Ukrainian missile was responsible, but that a fuller investigation was still underway. He stressed that there was no indication of a deliberate attack by Russia or of any Russian plans to attack a NATO ally meaning that NATOs commitment to collective defense was not at issue.\n\nBut even if the missile was Ukrainian, he said, the blame belonged to Russia.\n\n\"Let me be clear: This is not Ukraines fault,\" Mr. Stoltenberg said. \"Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe White House said it had \"full confidence\" in Polands investigation and had \"seen nothing that contradicts President Dudas preliminary assessment.\"\n\n\"That said, whatever the final conclusions may be, it is clear that the party ultimately responsible for this tragic incident is Russia, which launched a barrage of missiles on Ukraine specifically intended to target civilian infrastructure,\" the White House said in a statement. \"Ukraine had and has every right to defend itself.\"\n\nInitial reports had suggested the explosion might have been caused by a Russian missile, which prompted intense discussions and even some panic over whether Russia had somehow attacked a NATO ally, possible grounds to invoke the alliances mutual defense clause, defined in Article 5 of NATOs treaty. But the results of the investigation so far seemed to tamp down concerns that the explosion could escalate the conflict beyond Ukraines borders.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was skeptical of the preliminary conclusion, saying he had \"no doubt that it was not our missile.\" But he allowed for the possibility he was mistaken as he pushed for his country to have a role in the investigation.\n\n\"If it was the use of our air defense, then I want that evidence,\" he told Ukrainian news outlets on Wednesday.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, reiterated Moscows rejection of responsibility for the blast and complained that some had been all too ready to blame Russia noting that the U.S. response had been a welcome exception.\n\n\"One should never rush to pronounce judgments and statements that can escalate the situation, still more so at such crucial moments,\" he said.\n\n\"In this case,\" he added, \"it makes sense to pay attention to the restrained and far more professional response of the American side and the American president.\"\n\nThe explosion was a topic of discussion at a United Nations Security Council meeting on Wednesday. Vasily Nebenzya, Russias U.N. ambassador, reiterated the Kremlins denials of involvement. The Ukrainian ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said that Ukraine supports \"a full and transparent investigation to establish all the facts of this tragic incident.\"\n\nKey details on what transpired have yet to be clarified. There are questions about the trajectory of the missile in question and whether it might have been aiming at or had hit a Russian missile. Investigators will also focus on what the debris from Poland shows.\n\nMr. Duda said that \"preliminary examination of the scene indicates that there was no classic rocket explosion there, but that it was the result of the rockets fall, perhaps in conjunction with the explosion of the fuel that remained.\"\n\nHe also emphasized that the events in Poland had come amid a \"massive, unprecedented\" Russian attack on Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine defended itself which is obvious and understandable also by firing missiles whose task was to knock down Russian missiles,\" he said. \"Therefore we were dealing with a very serious clash caused by the Russian side, as well as the entire conflict. Yesterdays clash is certainly borne by the Russian side.\"\n\nMatthew Mpoke Bigg contributed reporting.",

But Russias invasion of Ukraine overshadowed the two-day summit. Here are our takeaways from the event.\n\nMonday, Nov 14 18:30 (JST)\n\nStage set for US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping\n\nOfficials are gathering at a hotel in Bali for a summit between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping. It will be the first in-person meeting between the pair since Biden became president in January 2021.\n\nMonday, Nov 14 19:00 (JST)\n\n'Recover Together, Recover Stronger'\n\nThe world continues to emerge from the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, a crisis that has taken a devastating toll on health and business alike.\n\nAs a reflection of the collective effort to rebuild the global economy, G20 president Indonesia has made the theme of this week's summit, \"Recover Together, Recover Stronger.\"\n\nHowever, Russia's invasion of Ukraine threatens to undermine that sense of solidarity.\n\nMonday, Nov 14 20:20 (JST)\n\nJoe Biden, Xi Jinping meet ahead of G20 summit\n\nBiden and Xi shook hands as they met at a luxury hotel on Nusa Dua bay in Bali.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Biden said he is \"committed to keeping lines of communications open\" with China.\n\n\"As the leaders of our two nations, we share responsibility, in my view, to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from ... turning into conflict, and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation.\"\n\nIn response, Xi said the sides \"need to chart the right course for the China-US relationship. We need to find the right direction for the bilateral relationship going forward and elevate the relationship. The world expects that China and the United States will properly handle the relationship.\"\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 08:50 (JST)\n\nThe fight against COVID-19 continues at G20 venue\n\nBig tents have been set up on a tennis court in front of the media center. This is where journalists go to get coronavirus antigen tests. Without a negative result, reporters cannot enter the media center. The result comes back in 5 minutes after medical staff insert a swab deep into your nose.\n\nThe outcome is registered in the press ID card. The test result is effective only for 24 hours. If you want to enter the center again the next day, you have to go through the same procedure.\n\nThere is also a PCR test facility. Its outcome is effective for 3 days, but it takes 30 minutes for the result to come back.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 09:00 (JST)\n\nFirst day of G20 summit to get underway\n\nLeaders of the Group of 20 nations are set to meet on Tuesday in Bali, Indonesia, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and food and energy security two items high on the agenda. The summit will take place without Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Kishida Fumio will use the two-day gathering to convey the country's position on these and other issues.\n\nIt's the first meeting of G20 leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nWe'll be updating this page throughout the days with reports, video and photos.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 09:20 (JST)\n\nPrayers for success of G20 summit\n\nBalinese Hinduism, a distinct form of Hindu worship practiced by the majority of people in Bali, places great importance on custom.\n\nOne daily ritual involves making an offering of \"canang,\" a woven basket fashioned from coconut leaves and filled with flowers, accompanied by an assortment of gifts for the Gods.\n\nBalinese people present canang at least twice a day as part of a prayer for balance and peace. These colorful offerings can be seen all around the venue of G20 summit.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 09:50 (JST)\n\nWorld leaders arriving at venue\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo is greeting world leaders arriving for the first day of the G20 summit.\n\nTuesday mornings working session will focus on issues like food and energy security.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 10:10 (JST)\n\nRussia's leader skipping G20 meeting\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is noticeably absent from this year's G20 guest list. The Kremlin has said his duties back home are keeping him from traveling abroad.\n\nFootage released by Russia's government shows him on a routine video call, just as world leaders were arriving in Bali.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is attending in his stead. He'll face tough talk from the United States and its allies about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 10:40 (JST)\n\nIndonesia: No G20 group photo planned\n\nAn Indonesian government official has confirmed there are no plans for a traditional \"family photo\" of the Group of 20 delegates.\n\nIt's believed the decision to cancel the photo shoot is related to deepening divisions between Western nations and Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 11:05 (JST)\n\nG20 summit kicks off\n\nLeaders of the Group of 20 nations have started their two-day summit in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nGlobal issues like the rising cost of food and energy, recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and technological innovation top their agenda.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio are among the leaders attending.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin opted to send his foreign minister to represent Moscow, with his country's invasion of Ukraine expected to loom large over the meeting.\n\nThe US and its allies blame Russian aggression for fueling inflation around the world, while the Kremlin has accused Western countries of triggering a global economic crisis through sanctions.\n\nMeanwhile, China and India, as well the chair of this year's summit, Indonesia, have continued to distance themselves from the conflict, neither condemning nor supporting either side.\n\nAll eyes are on whether the leaders can reach some kind of consensus or depart from Bali more divided than ever.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 11:20 (JST)\n\nZelenskyy welcomes US-China statement on nuclear weapons\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised remarks made by the leaders of the US and China on the sidelines of the G20 summit.\n\nIn an official statement published by the White House, President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping \"reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won and underscored their opposition to the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\"\n\nIn a video address, Zelenskyy suggested the joint statement is an important message to Russia, saying \"Everyone understands to whom these words are addressed.\"\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 11:30 (JST)\n\nCambodian PM tests positive for COVID-19, cancels G20 visit\n\nCambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has scrapped plans to attend meetings in Bali after confirming on Facebook he had contracted COVID-19.\n\nCambodia is not a member of the G20, but Sen was invited to take part as a guest after serving as chair of this year's Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\nASEAN held its own summit in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, over the weekend, with the leaders of the US and Japan in attendance.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 11:40 (JST)\n\nJapan's top govt. spokesperson: US-China stability 'extremely important'\n\nOn Tuesday, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsuno Hirokazu was asked by reporters for his government's reaction to Monday's meeting between the leaders of the US and China.\n\nHe refused to weigh-in, but said stability between the two countries is extremely important for the international community.\n\nHe said the US is a close partner, and \"Japan will continue to promote various forms of cooperation, while urging China to fulfill its responsibilities as a major power.\"\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 12:10 (JST)\n\nMorning session under way\n\nG20 leaders have sat down for their first session of their two-day summit. The focus of today's talks is on the broad issue of global food and energy security, with the effects of the ongoing war in Ukraine taking center stage.\n\nBefore heading in, European Council President Charles Michel said the best way to end the global crisis over food and fuel was for Russia to end its invasion.\n\nA senior US official also told reporters that President Joe Biden will push for the G20 to issue a joint statement opposing Russia's actions.\n\nIt's unlikely there will be G20 \"consensus\" toward condemning Moscow, given that Russia is among the group's members. But the US and European leaders will likely try convincing so-far neutral powers, like India and China, to take a tougher stance.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 12:30 (JST)\n\nG20 chair opens summit with call for leaders to come together, avoid another \"cold war\"\n\nThis year's G20 chairperson, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, has opened the talks with some blunt words about the growing rift between some of the countries taking part in the talks.\n\nHe told gathered leaders that they cannot allow the world to fall into another cold war.\n\nWithout directly referring to Ukraine, Widodo also called for \"the war\" to end, saying the world cannot \"move on\" until it does.\n\nHe also called on G20 leaders, whose countries represent around 80 percent of the world's GDP, to \"deliver concrete outcomes to support global economic recovery.\"\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 12:35 (JST)\n\nNHK at the summit\n\nTop diplomats and heads of state are not the only ones who've converged on Bali from all corners of the globe.\n\nJournalists from around the world are at the scene, and NHK is there to bring you the latest from this summit.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 12:50 (JST)\n\nWatch: Praying for good weather over Bali\n\nWith world leaders deeply divided over Ukraine, things could get stormy inside the G20 summit. But some practitioners of Indonesia's traditional faith are praying for clear skies -- outside.\n\nRara Istiani Wulandari is a \"pawang hujan,\" or rain shaman. Tuesday morning, she conducted a ritual to ensure good weather for the two-day meeting in Bali. She asked for the rains to stay away until after it wraps-up.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 14:30 (JST)\n\nZelenskyy calls on world leaders to help end war\n\nIn a speech delivered via video link, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reportedly told the gathering that he is \"convinced now is the time\" to end Russia's invasion of his country under a peace plan that he has proposed. He also urged world leaders to provide Ukraine with effective security assurances.\n\nThe EU Ambassador to Indonesia, Vincent Piket, tweeted that the speech was \"impassioned yet detailed.\"\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 15:40 (JST)\n\nKishida's G20 attendance part of a busy week of diplomacy\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio is about half-way through a summit-heavy tour of southeast Asia.\n\nHe arrived in Bali for the G20 meeting on Monday. While there, he's expected to join the US and other partners in uniting against Russia, as its invasion of Ukraine drags on.\n\nOver the weekend, he attended the Association of Southeast Asian Nations conference in Phnom Penh.\n\nWhile in Cambodia, he sat down for trilateral talks with the presidents of the US and South Korea. Their conversation focused heavily on how to maintain pressure on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nNext, Kishida is scheduled to head to Bangkok, Thailand, for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.\n\nOn Thursday, Kishida is scheduled to hold face-to-face talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping. It will be the first meeting of its kind between the leaders of Japan and China in about three years. It also comes on the heels of US President Joe Biden's meeting with Xi on Monday.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 15:45 (JST)\n\nIMF chief urges G20 heads to reject trade protectionism\n\nThe head of the International Monetary Fund has implored G20 leaders to resist the creeping tide of trade protectionism, and urged them instead to \"allow trade to do its job.\"\n\nIMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocs would significantly hurt growth.\n\nShe said removing barriers for food and fertilizers, among other things, could alleviate the suffering of hundreds of millions of people.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 15:50 (JST)\n\nNo group photo, as host nation tries to keep the peace\n\nNHK World's Yoshioka Takuma is in Bali. He described what appears to be a careful effort by the host nation to ensure political tensions don't dominate the headlines at the expense of other matters.\n\n\"On the surface, things are business as usual. Just like always, the president of the host nation welcomed leaders with a big smile. But reporters here soon found something unusual. Nowhere on the schedule was the group photo session. It's a safe bet that this arrangement has to do with what's happening in Ukraine.\n\n\"When the G20 foreign ministers met in July, all of the G7 countries skipped the welcome reception in protest against Russia. So it's highly likely that the host nation didn't want to show off just how deep the divisions between the West and Russia have become.\n\n\"Russian media reports that Moscow will continue to push the idea that the G20 should be about the global economy, not politics.\n\n\"The G20 nations make up more than 80 percent of global GDP. It's not just about Russia or China or the rest of the G7. It's meant to give a voice to emerging economies like Indonesia, India, Saudi Arabia and Brazil who have not imposed their own sanctions against Russia.\"\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 16:18 (JST)\n\nXi projects aura of comfort and strength\n\nNHK World's Beijing correspondent Nakamura Genta has been following developments at the summit.\n\nHe notes that Chinese President Xi Jinping was smiling and looking relaxed as the US-China talks got underway.\n\n\"It looked like he wanted this to be an opportunity to fix the relationship\" between the two world powers. \"But we didn't see breakthroughs on the big issues. Xi was direct with Biden, and said he wouldn't give an inch on Taiwan.\"\n\nThis is Xi's first overseas trip since he consolidated his power at home by securing an unprecedented third term as leader at the Communist Party congress.\n\nThe summit provides him an ideal opportunity to show the strength of his leadership to the world.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 16:20 (JST)\n\nG20 talks resume after lunch break, focus on health\n\nLeaders of G20 nations have reconvened after a short break.\n\nThe afternoon session is expected to focus on global health, with recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic a key priority for the summit.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio will speak. He's expected to call on other world leaders to help build a more robust and cooperative defence against future pandemics, and to help make equitable health care available for all peoples around the world.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 16:30 (JST)\n\nWatch: What do the locals want?\n\nThe G20 leaders are grappling with a range of thorny subjects -- food and energy security, post-pandemic economic recovery efforts, and climate change among them. NHK World's Yoshioka Takuma ventured out onto the streets of Bali and the capital Jakarta to find out what issues matter most to Indonesians, and ask them what they're hoping to see from the people who run the world's most advanced economies.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 16:55 (JST)\n\nWhy Xi Jinping and Joe Biden's pre-G20 meeting matters\n\nJust after they arrived in Bali, the leaders of China and the US sat down for talks. NHK Worlds Yoshioka Takuma has more on what they discussed, and how the meeting has set the stage for the G20 summit.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 17:00 (JST)\n\nReuters: Draft G20 declaration condemns war in Ukraine\n\nReuters is reporting that a draft declaration by G20 leaders strongly condemns the war in Ukraine. The 16-page document, which has yet to be adopted, blames the conflict for exacerbating weaknesses in the global economy. It reportedly says: \"Recognizing that the G20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, we acknowledge that security issues can have significant consequences for the global economy.\"\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 17:20 (JST)\n\nFIFA Chief calls for World Cup ceasefire\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has told G20 leaders that soccer can provide a \"unique platform\" for peace.\n\nHe's called on Russia and Ukraine to enter a temporary ceasefire during the World Cup in Qatar. The competition, which happens every four years, kicks off Sunday, Nov. 20, with the final match scheduled for Dec. 18.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 18:00 (JST)\n\nMacron, Xi agree on urgency of de-escalation in Ukraine\n\nThe leaders of France and China have held talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit. Emmanuel Macron and Xi Jinping are reported to have discussed a range of subjects, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Elysee Palace released a statement that said the two presidents declared their support for the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine, their strong opposition to the use of nuclear weapons, and their desire for an urgent de-escalation of the conflict.\n\nThe leaders also said they'll move ahead with the implementation of a common debt treatment framework, which is designed to support the financing of the world's most vulnerable economies, such as Zambia.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 18:20 (JST)\n\nXi criticizes weaponization of food and energy security\n\nA statement from China's foreign ministry says Xi Jinping has urged the world to reject any attempt to use food and energy as political \"tools and weapons.\" The statement says the Chinese President told the G20 summit on Tuesday that \"unilateral sanctions must be removed, and restrictions on relevant scientific and technological cooperation must be lifted,\" an unambiguous reference to the punitive measures used by the US and other nations against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nXi also reportedly said, \"Drawing ideological lines or promoting group politics and bloc confrontation will only divide the world, and hinder global development and human progress.\"\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 18:40 (JST)\n\nCountries clash over Ukraine situation\n\nDiplomatic sources have told NHK that the summit's morning session on food and energy security turned into a tense exchange between Russia's delegate and a handful of Western leaders as they traded accusations over the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reportedly took aim at the West over the hefty sanctions it has imposed on Moscow following the Ukraine invasion. His remarks drew a swift rebuke from French President Emmanuel Macron, with other leaders quick to back him up.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 19:30 (JST)\n\nLavrov denies report of health problem\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dismissed a news report that he was taken to hospital with a heart condition on Monday after arriving on the island of Bali for the G20 summit.\n\nIn a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, Lavrov claimed the report was fake news concocted by Western media.\n\nHe said he had spent the day preparing for the gathering.\n\nA Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson has posted a video of Lavrov sitting outdoors in shorts and a T-shirt, reading documents, apparently in good health.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 19:40 (JST)\n\nRussia's FM: West trying to 'politicize' G20 declaration\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has accused Western nations of trying to \"politicize\" a joint declaration at the G20 summit in Bali.\n\nLavrov also lashed out at the punitive measures imposed by Western countries on Russia, blaming them for making energy more expensive and less secure in developing countries.\n\nThe draft declaration by G20 leaders, obtained by NHK on Tuesday, says most members strongly condemn the war in Ukraine.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 19:45 (JST)\n\nDraft declaration: Most G20 members strongly condemn war in Ukraine\n\nLeaders of the G20 nations are working on a draft resolution on Tuesday, with most members willing to support a statement that strongly condemns the war in Ukraine, according to a copy obtained by NHK.\n\nThe draft, which has not been adopted, also acknowledges that there is a diversity of opinions among the group with the line: \"There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions.\"\n\nThe summit on the Indonesian island of Bali is the first meeting of G20 leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nThe war, which Russia has described as a \"special military operation,\" has overshadowed the meeting, despite calls by the host nation to focus on global economic problems such as inflation, and food and energy security.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 19:50 (JST)\n\nLavrov talks up Russia-China ties\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was at pains to emphasize the friendship between his country and China on Tuesday when he met with his counterpart Wang Yi in Bali.\n\nLavrov noted that it was their tenth meeting this year, and added that the Chinese and Russian presidents also get together on a regular basis.\n\nThe minister is attending the summit in place of President Putin. He's been on the receiving end of some pointed words from Western leaders at the gathering, and appears eager to dispel the perception that Russia is growing more diplomatically isolated.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 20:00 (JST)\n\nWatch: G20 leaders mingle at lunch\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 20:15 (JST)\n\nBritish PM highlights 'international condemnation' of Russia\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said there was \"international condemnation of Russia's war in Ukraine\" at the G20 summit on Tuesday morning, adding that leaders \"highlighted the illegality and the barbaric nature of Russia's war and also the devastating impact that it is having on people around the world through higher food and energy prices.\"\n\nSunak said that \"G20 allies\" have a responsibility to fix the global economy, and to safeguard and preserve the international order.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 21:40 (JST)\n\nDinner closes out first day at G20\n\nLeaders of the G20 are now attending a dinner, which brings an end to the first day of proceedings at the G20 summit in Bali.\n\nTuesday, Nov 15 23:00 (JST)\n\nPress gallery pampered and primed\n\nThe hordes of reporters who've descended on the Indonesian island are enjoying a very comfortable stay indeed.

Where did it come from?\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war risked being escalated further on November 15, when a missile killed two people in Poland. As world leaders scrambled to figure out where it came from, many were concerned that the conflict had moved to the brink of World War III. NATO leaders said they did not believe the missile was a Russian attack, but rather a Ukrainian missile accidentally shot into Polish territory. But should more countries be worried about the war spilling over onto their soil?\n\nIn this episode:\n\nJames Bays (@baysontheroad), Al Jazeera diplomatic editor\n\nAl Jazeera diplomatic editor Bartosz Weglarczyk (@bweglarczyk), Editor-in-chief of Onet.PL\n\nConnect with us:\n\n@AJEPodcasts on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook\n\nFull episode transcript:\n\nThis transcript was created using AI. Its been reviewed by humans, but it might contain errors. Please let us know if you have any corrections or questions, our email is TheTake@aljazeera.net.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: The Russia-Ukraine war just entered its tenth month, but last week, another country got drawn into the conflict.\n\nNewsreel: Violence from the war in Ukraine has now reportedly spilled over into neighbouring Poland.\n\nNewsreel: Two people were killed when a missile fell in a Polish village near the border with Ukraine.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: The missile that hit Poland caused ripples in the back rooms of NATO and the G20 meeting in Bali, with world leaders trying to figure out where it came from. And if, as some believed, the missile had been an attack from Russia, many were worried it could take the conflict to the brink of World War III. So, where did the missile that hit Poland come from and how worried should other countries in the region be that the same could happen to them?\n\n[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: Im Halla Mohieddeen and this is The Take.\n\n[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: When a missile killed two farmers in Poland last week, many of the worlds top leaders were in Bali, Indonesia for the G20 summit. So was Al Jazeeras Diplomatic Editor, James Bays. Ashish Malhotra, a producer for The Take, caught up with James to find out what it was like in Bali when the news trickled in.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nAshish Malhotra: Take us through sort of the behind the scenes as this news unfolded while you were at the G20. What was it like being there when this news came in?\n\nJames Bays: Well, the G20 this year was always going to be about Ukraine. On the first day, the world leaders then went to bed, but most of them were woken very early, before dawn, with the news that the missile had hit Polish territory, which sounded like a major, major development in the war. I myself was woken up by the news desk and told, \"We need you to go live.\"\n\nNewsreel: Our diplomatic editor James Bays is joining us now from the G20 summit in Bali, where the leaders have been discussing the explosion. James, I know\n\nJames Bays: \"We need you to tell us the latest and we need you to assess what this actually means.\" We learned that President Biden had been woken and had made a phone call to President Duda of Poland at 5:30 in the morning local time to try and get the latest information. What was interesting in those early moments was the White House was very, very cautious. It said, we are going to be cautious, were going to discover the facts. Were going to discover exactly what happened here. The speculation, of course, was this was a Russian missile that had hit the farm on the Polish border, killing two people. And that wouldve been a major, major development in the war. It wouldve been the first time someone had been killed in a NATO country as a result of the Russian war in Ukraine.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: James told Ashish that the developments in Poland caused a major shift in the focus of the summit.\n\nJames Bays: The actual summit was supposed to be talking about climate change. And in fact, all the world leaders were going to plant mangroves. That was the photo opportunity that the world was going to see while they talked about the climate crisis. But that actually was postponed by an hour, and some of the world leaders decided to have a meeting, which was interesting. A meeting chaired by President Biden, and at the end of that meeting, they issued a statement condemning the missile attacks, which had also taken place on Ukraine, and saying there needed to be an investigation into what had happened in Poland. There was no condemnation of Russia in that statement. And the reason why, I think emerged just a few minutes later, when President Biden was speaking to reporters.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: Thats when James got an update through whats called a pool report, where reporters who follow the US president closely share information with other journalists about developments on major issues.\n\nJames Bays: The first I learned was when I got a pool report that came through, giving a brief transcript of what President Biden had said. I quickly skimmed through this report, but at the end of it was the key bit of information. It said, \"Asked whether it was too early to say the missile came from Russia, Biden said theres preliminary information that contests that. I dont want to say that until we completely investigate. It is unlikely in the lines of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia, but well see.\" And at that moment, the story completely changed. The fact there was US doubt of the fact this was a Russian missile, which until then was the working assumption of, I think all the world leaders, but also of all the reporters who were covering it. And that moment the story changed and clearly, I think there was a sense of relief among the world leaders that a really serious situation had probably been averted.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: The fears of escalation stemmed from the idea that if Poland, a member of NATO, had been attacked then all of NATO would be seen as under attack. Its a principle steeped in Articles 4 and 5 of NATOs founding treaty, something Ashish asked James about.\n\nAshish Malhotra: Can you just outline what Article 4 and 5 of the NATO founding treaty are and why theyre important? What the stakes involved are when it comes to these articles.\n\nJames Bays: Yeah, no, I mean, that is why we were so concerned about the situation. Because if you look back at the Washington Treaty or the North Atlantic Treaty its got two names it has what is often known as the all for one clause, which is Article 5. And that says, if any NATO nation is attacked, they can consider it an attack on all of them. Which meant potentially that if Poland had been attacked by Russia, it might be considered an attack on all of the NATO members. That potentially, could have meant that NATO was at war with Russia.\n\nAshish Malhotra: Right.\n\nJames Bays: Now, theres quite a few caveats here.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nJames Bays: Theres a long process to declaring Article 5. Its only ever happened in history once, and that was in 2001 after 9/11.\n\nGeorge Robertson: The attack against the United States of America on the 11th of September was directed from abroad and shall therefore be regarded as an action covered by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.\n\nJames Bays: And even though you might think that was a pretty clear-cut case of an attack on the United States, actually, it took about a month for NATO to decide to invoke Article 5.\n\nAshish Malhotra: Yeah.\n\nJames Bays: So, its something that theyre very very careful about doing and NATO takes a lot of steps. I mean, they have intensive plans. They have a procedure. They have a step-by-step procedure that NATO follows. They war game things. They plan for everything. Im sure it was something that they had thought might happen. What will we do if Russia accidentally hits a NATO country?\n\nAshish Malhotra: Right.\n\nJames Bays: Because that was the working theory of most of the journalists because Russia was denying this. Russia didnt say, weve just launched an attack on Poland. They said, no, no, we didnt do it. So, I think even if it had been an accident, Article 5 probably would not have been invoked. But I think also, the fact that NATO very cautiously investigated this. And then as soon as it knew that it was not a Russian or a missile fired from Russia, they put out statements. And I think that is probably something that can reassure us a bit. But on the other hand, this shows how a mistake, a miscalculation, could turn into something really serious. In fact, horrendously serious.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: Those fears were, of course, felt in Poland as well. Bartosz Weglarczyk is the editor-in-chief of Onet, the most popular news website in Poland. He says tensions were high as the news came in.\n\nBartosz Weglarczyk: The first news we got was about 6PM local time. And the news was that something happened in southeast Poland, very close to the border with Ukraine. And at first, we had no idea what happened. We just knew something bad happened. Then the first news came actually from the local hospital. And the news was two people died, and a missile hit something in Poland. We still didnt know what. So, you know, the first thing we thought was, holy cow, If its a Russian missile if it was shot at Poland, thats World War III, right? Thats NATO against Russia.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nBartosz Weglarczyk: We still had no idea what happened officially because the Polish government didnt say anything till like, after 11PM local time. They didnt want to say anything because they didnt you know, the key question was, is it a Russian missile? Or maybe its a Ukrainian missile? So the first few hours, we were just gasping for air. We were just, you know, looking for any kind of info.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: As James told Ashish, NATO leaders were quick to say that they did not believe the missile came from Russia and that it was probably a misfire from Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was quick to deny that suggestion, and an investigation is ongoing. But regardless of where the missile came from, Bartosz says most Poles blame Russia.\n\nBartosz Weglarczyk: When we found out its not a Russian attack, you know, we breathe a little bit. Everybody said, well, it was a misfire. At the same time its still a tragedy. Two citizens of Poland died. So, I do believe there should be repercussions. And I do believe there will be repercussions on the side of NATO and European Union. Its not Ukrainians fault that they were attacked by Russia and it was a misfire. Misfires happen. The only people to be blamed are Russians who started the war, and thats the feeling probably of majority of Polish public opinion.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: And even though last week was the first time Polish territory was struck, the Polish people have in many ways felt like the conflict has spilled into their country since it began in February.\n\nBartosz Weglarczyk: You go to any store in Poland and if you dont find anybody from Ukraine working there, I would be surprised. You know, because Ukrainians are working everywhere now. Everywhere. Now in Warsaw, Ukrainian language is almost as popular as Polish. So, we are obviously not part of the war, but you know, the war is very close to us, so you have news all over Polish media all the time.\n\nNewsreel: [Speaking in Polish]\n\nBartosz Weglarczyk: 24 hours a day, theres something about Ukraine somewhere.\n\n[POLISH MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: But Bartosz says the war is not just something theyre looking at through their screens.\n\nBartosz Weglarczyk: There are military installations and transportation hubs of the Ukrainian military very close to the border. People heard Russian missiles flying very close before. They heard them landing in Ukraine, very close to the border of Poland, since the start of the war. You know, its scary. First of all, youre scared because when the war started, everybody in Poland was thinking, you know, what is the Russian plan? Do they attack Ukraine or you know, will they go further? Do they want to attack NATO? Is it world war starting? So, everybody was thinking about it back in February.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: But the fears have only escalated as the stakes have risen.\n\nBartosz Weglarczyk: Then, you know, next thing was the nuclear weapons. Do Russians want to use them in Ukraine? What happens if they use them close to the Polish border? Should we take precautions? You know, should we do something? Everybody who has anything to do with news all the journalists, people in government, were asked by friends, by family members. Should we leave Poland? Should we run away? Should we escape? So, you know, its scary.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: After the break, whats the risk of continued spillover from the war into neighbouring countries?\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: The missile that killed two farmers in Polish territory last week has raised serious questions about how frequently there might be spillover from the Russia-Ukraine war into neighbouring countries. The Take producer Ashish Malhotra explored the fallout with Al Jazeeras Diplomatic Editor, James Bays.\n\nAshish Malhotra: How much of a risk do you think this is that were gonna continue to see spillover like this continue to happen? You know, should we prepare to just get used to this being a regular occurrence for countries in the neighbourhood? Could this be something that we see every few weeks?\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nJames Bays: I think the whole period of this war has been a high risk, high stakes moment for the world. There are those that say that we are the closest to a world war, to a nuclear war, potentially, that weve been at any time since the Cuban missile crisis. I dont think this tension goes away. Its good news on this occasion that theres been caution, theres been investigation, and the world has stepped back from confrontation. But were still, I think, at a dangerous time. This is a dangerous moment for the world and that danger will not disappear while the war in Ukraine continues. There is the possibility for miscalculation. Theres the possibility for accident, theres the possibility for escalation. Remember, the nuclear plants in Ukraine too. There is the possibility of something awful happening, and there has been that possibility ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: Bartosz says people in Poland are also worried about more errant attacks on their soil.\n\nBartosz Weglarczyk: I mean, is it on peoples minds? Of course it is. And there are a lot of things happening on the border of Poland and Ukraine. Everybody knows and understands that all the military equipment that the Ukraine military get, has to get to Ukraine somehow. And its obvious how it gets there. So you know, you ask people who live in southeast Poland, close to the Ukrainian border. Theyre scared to death. They really are. You know, these two guys, two farmers, they were just working their field. You know, they didnt do anything. And so you talk to people over there and theyre really scared. But to tell you the truth, theres not much we can do about this. There are some discussions about getting better missile defence in Poland, but at the same time, how do you build a missile defence for a cornfield that is five kilometres away from the border? How you know, theres no way to defend it. So, yeah, if you ask me, I think things like this will happen in the future, unfortunately. Lets hope and pray that nobody dies.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: And yet, he says, preparation has already been under way in Poland and other countries in the region for some time.\n\nBartosz Weglarczyk: When you travel to southeast Poland, close to the border of Ukraine, you can see a lot of military planes and patriot batteries and S-300 batteries and tanks and military convoys. Its there in case Russia decides to do something else. So its there, its in Baltic states. There are the whole battalions and, you know, we have US military personnel and a lot of military personnel from other countries.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nBartosz Weglarczyk: It looks like war actually over there. Its really scary.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: On Monday, Poland accepted an offer from Germany for a missile defence system to help secure its airspace. And Bartosz believes the military buildup in countries surrounding Russia and Ukraine will only continue to grow.\n\nBartosz Weglarczyk: The problem is that we have no idea what Putin was thinking when he decided to go to war. What was his idea? What would happen? What he was trying to achieve? So, at the moment like this, when you dont understand why some other country is doing something extremely stupid and dangerous, and you dont understand their purpose, then you have to get ready for the worst scenario. And the worst scenario is, this guys crazy. And you know, we dont know if hes crazy, but we have to get ready for this. So, the number of military equipment and military personnel in Baltic states, Romania, and Poland is getting bigger. And because of the missile accident, it will get even bigger now.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: But while Russia and Ukraines neighbours prepare for the worst, the death and destruction continues to mount for the two warring parties.\n\n[SOUND OF EXPLOSION]\n\nNewsreel: That is dashboard camera video capturing an airstrike in Dnipro in southern Ukraine, shared by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on social media.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: On the same day that the missile struck Poland, Russia fired over 90 missiles at Ukraine, something James says is their main strategy at this point.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nJames Bays: Well, certainly, Russia has decided that that is the best way, or the only way right now, it can deal with what are Ukrainian gains. Considerable Ukrainian gains on the battlefield. The retaking of Kherson, the only regional capital that Russia managed to conquer during this war, the retaking of it by Ukrainian forces. Russia is losing on the battlefield, and Russias only response is this deluge of missiles on Ukraine, now deliberately targeting the power plants in Ukraine and cutting the electricity, meaning a pretty grim winter for many Ukrainian citizens.\n\nNewsreel: Its been a week of missiles and Iranian-supplied drone strikes. The offices of Ukrenergo, a state owned energy company, hit.\n\nNewsreel: Ukraines president said today that roughly 30 percent of Ukraines power generation has been attacked and knocked offline by new Russian attacks.\n\nJames Bays: But it doesnt change the reality on the battlefield. Ukraine is the one that has been winning. Ukraine is the one that has been regaining territory.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: But James says the winter and cold temperatures will also change the nature of the war.\n\nJames Bays: I think potentially, you are looking at some months of a slower conflict. Not necessarily, though, a more peaceful time. Effectively, youre going to get people digging in. Youre gonna effectively get sort of a form, a modern form of trench warfare during these winter months, which could still see, I think, some pretty grim casualty figures from both sides. And remember, the statistics and we dont have proper figures but the estimate is that both sides have either killed or wounded about a hundred thousand troops. So, this is a pretty, pretty, pretty grim conflict that is going to drag on. I dont see any possibility right now of it not. President Zelensky is very, very firm that the war continues until Russia has left Ukraine completely.\n\nHalla Mohieddeen: And thats The Take.

                "cc_text": "Image Source: US State Department\n\nFood insecurity in Africa and around the globe has long been recognized as a key, upstream contributor to manifold crises: from political instability, to unrest, to violent extremism, to mass migration. The relationship is also cyclical; war and political instability tend to worsen food insecurity. When it comes to U.S. policy options for addressing these correlated threats, the toolkit has generally been limited to sending food, cash, drones, troops, or some combination of these. During the Global War on Terrorism, it was exceedingly difficult for policymakers to afford any resources or institutional attention to the upstream causes of their present-day threats. After all, downstream, band-aid solutions are understandable, given how government budgeting preferences the priorities of the \"now\" over those of tomorrow. But to procrastinate on thinking seriously about upstream threat multipliers in Africa like food insecurity is to relegate future budgets and policymakers to the same purgatory of pursuing limited aims with limited means.\n\nHow can the United States Africa strategy go bold on food security without evading the demands of the present? Israel, the UAE, and the Abraham Accords provide a clue.\n\nThe Abrahamic model AgTech and diplomacy\n\nMuch can be learned from the links between innovation, food security, and diplomatic access in the Abraham Accords. Israel, for its part, has long shown itself to be a global leader in agricultural innovation from creating an entire forest in the desert in the 1960s to now boasting over 300 recent desert tech startups mostly in the Negev desert in which a cumulative $347 million have been invested as of 2022. Importantly, Israeli entrepreneurship and innovation in this sector have helped them break new ground in recent years in their relations with several Arab neighbors. Through the Abraham Accords, the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco showed they would rather cooperate on shared threats like sustaining growing populations in increasingly arid climes than solve them on their own. In other words, the trajectory of Israeli startups and their track record in agricultural technology (AgTech) have become huge diplomatic assets. Sudan, another desert country likely to get only more arid with climate change, joined the Accords in 2021. Israeli ingenuity in solving issues critical to African (and Middle Eastern) food security is a lynchpin of their strategic success and regional identity.\n\nSimilarly, the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) has made AgTech a priority not only for their own domestic development, but for their regional position as a business partner of choice for many. The ADIO, according to their director, Dr. Tariq bin Hendi, committed $100 million in R&D and production contracts in 2020 to four companies leading the charge on next-generation irrigation technologies: AeroFarms, Madar Farms, RDI, and RNZ, with plans to export their success stories to \"every arid climate.\"\n\nIn the United States, however, investment in public R&D in AgTech has steadily fallen for over two decades constituting a major missed opportunity to contribute to an industry so many Africans care about with broad strategic, humanitarian, and economic implications, as our Middle Eastern allies have shown us. Accordingly, U.S. investment in this industry should reflect its significance as a diplomatic tool and should consider the following approach.\n\nNew-look approach\n\nIn the United States, several federal agencies are working on food security in Africa; the problem is that their contributions are either too downstream or too piecemeal to reshape the long-term outlook. USAIDs Feeding the Future initiative has done great work in relieving famines and fertilizer supply chain issues, but focuses more on the mitigation rather than upstream prevention of crises. The International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) does important work in conjunction with USAID through this same initiative. It also provides loans to subsistence farmers in Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania through its One Acre Fund. But while the DFC, USAID, and DoS make piecemeal progress, our allies in Israel and the UAE demonstrate the potential of bold investment strategies.\n\nTo maximize its impact, the DFC should reorient its priorities away from loans to smallholder farms and toward direct equity investments in the early development technologies that have already proven potential. With finite funds, the DFCs impact will be limited by spreading its resources over too many downstream development problem sets. The DFCs Office of Direct Equity should take a cue from the Abu Dhabi Investment Office and look to the companies already off the ground in Israel and the UAE, since these startups have the best chance to develop and scale world-changing solutions. After all, DFCs own evaluation criteria for eligible projects stipulate a company must show \"real revenue and demonstrated product to market fit.\" Doubling down on promising startups like the Israeli WaterGen, which extracts drinkable water from the air, or the Emirati funded Responsive Drip Irrigation, may be the safest and fastest way for U.S. aid agencies and federal investment dollars to make an impact in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and other arid climes.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. Small Business Administration should give more attention to both R&D and production contracts for American desert agriculture startups. The American southwest is well positioned to contribute startups to this effort with abundant talent pools at institutions like UC Davis Digital Agriculture Laboratory and the University of Arizonas Yuma Center for Excellence in Desert Agriculture. Boldness in the agricultural innovations of tomorrow may seem tangential to Americas regional strategy in Africa and pull resources from more pressing needs, but if the Middle East is any indicator, it may well be critical to opening doors (and keeping them open) in the region.\n\nMaking desert agriculture technology and investment a lynchpin of our grand strategy on the continent could produce several second and third order strategic benefits:\n\nA more politically resilient Africa: Better fed populations will likely be better positioned to sustain and build on moments of political progress Migration: Enhanced food security is one less reason to flee ones country Renewed ties with African partners: such an initiative could rehabilitate the U.S. as the partner of choice for countries that have drifted to China.\n\nAfter all, the Biden Administrations U.S. Strategy Towards Sub-Saharan Africa professes a willingness to center African interests and African agency in contrast to the transactional approaches of other great powers. The African Unions Agenda 2063, for its part, lists agricultural innovation as a critical component in their vision for a sustainable Africa. Ushering American public and private capital into this sector with greater urgency, therefore, puts our money where our mouth is and will be well worth the investment.",

                "cc_text": "Vladimir Putins war in Ukraine has exposed weaknesses in the Russian state, from rot in the army to the Kremlins authoritarian echo chamber. The war has also hastened Russias decline. The country has suffered enormous losses on the battlefield, and it has been cut off from important energy markets and access to critical technologies. Does this mean Russia should be ruled outor at least downgradedas a threat?\n\nDeputy Editor Kate Brannen and authors Andrea Kendall-Taylor and Michael Kofman mark the launch of the November/December 2022 issue of Foreign Affairs with a discussion of Russian power and how it could threaten U.S. interests in the years to come.\n\nTranscript:\n\nBRANNEN: Welcome, everybody, to the launch of the November-December 2022 issue of Foreign Affairs. Im Kate Brannen. Im deputy editor of the magazine.\n\nAnd Im thrilled to be joined today by Andrea Kendall-Taylor and Michael Kofman. Andrea is director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for New American Security, and Michael is the research program director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analysis and a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security.\n\nIm excited to talk to you both today about your recent article, \"Russias Dangerous Decline.\" It really serves as a warning not to become too complacent about Russian power and the threat it might pose, despite its losses on the battlefield.\n\nBefore we get to that, though, Id like to talk to youhave you both walk us through what the war has done to Russian power sort of before we warn about not writing it off yet. But it, obviously, has suffered through the course of the war so far, and I thought we could start with the military.\n\nAnd, Michael, if you could tell us what toll the war has taken on the Russian military and what your thoughts are about recent mobilization and what impact that could have at reviving that power, if any.\n\nKOFMAN: Sure, and thanks for the invitation to participate in the discussion today.\n\nSo the war, at least, certainly, the last eight months of it, have inflicted tremendous costs on Russias conventional forces, particularly, its ground forces. Russia has spent and misspent a lot of its best manpower, a good deal of its armored force, and a fair amount of ammunition, special artillery ammunition, and a good deal of its park of conventional and precision-guided weapons.\n\nThat said, Russia still retains a lot of some of the higher-end capabilities that are most concerning for NATO and for the U.S. in defense planning. These are things like integrated air defense, advanced submarines, counter satellite systems and the like, and many of these have either not been used or used but not lost in large amounts in the war in Ukraine.\n\nTo be perfectly frank, I think a lot of times in military planning probably the least concerning aspect of the Russian force were sort of modernized late 80s Soviet-era tanks and infantry fighting vehicles and much more concerning with these higher-end capabilities and their implications.\n\nAll right. So where does it leave the Russian military? Well, its still fighting. Mobilization can help Russia fix some of the structural problems in its force in terms of its manpower deficit in the war. But it cant fix the quality side of the equation in terms of the level of training of the personnel, leadershipRussia has lost a lot of its best officers and a lot of its best equipment.\n\nIf the Russian leadership had chosen to mobilize back in April after the initial invasion, clearly, failed, it might have led to somewhat different outcomes because they still had a large percentage of the force available. They had enlisted professionals, officers. They had a lot more equipment to use. But they didnt.\n\nSo mobilizing into the winter, I think, is partly an act of desperation to stabilize their lines, but they have conscripted a fairly sizable amount of personnel and the question is whats that going to yield for them three to four months later.\n\nI think it could extend the war. Quantity is not deterministic but it does actually matter. Mobilization had significant positive effects for Ukraine. Russia doesnt benefit from the intangibles that Ukraine does. It doesnt have the motivation or the morale, on the one hand, but on the other hand, it could, nonetheless, extend the war.\n\nI can see a couple different trajectories that the situation could take in the next several months. Could simply make offensives more challenging or more costly. So its a picture to watch, and I think a better period to assess the net effect of mobilization might be something towards February rather than right now.\n\nBRANNEN: OK. I also wanted to talk about the Russian military industrial base because this is really a war of attrition. It comes down to who runs out of ammo and equipment and people first, and in Washington you hear a lot of concern and a lot of talk about the American industrial base because its supplying the Ukraine side of the war, and you hear less about the Russian military industrial base, and I think of it as sort of these industrial bases, including Europe, sort of squaring off against each other.\n\nWhat has been the impact on the Russian military industrial base, not just the war but, obviously, American sanctions and Western sanctions, and where is it having the most trouble in supplying its own troops and how does it find workarounds? Because I know that is alsoyou hear about chips from washing machines being repurposed in missiles and things like that.\n\nSo how is Russia sort of being creative to get around these problems its facing?\n\nKOFMAN: Sure. Theres a couple of different issues there.\n\nSo, first, regarding our own defense industrial base, its clear that, in many respects, weve become victims of the efficiency model, which may work in business but is not necessarily suitable forwhen youre planning for major wars.\n\nConventional wars do come down to attrition and they come down to replaceability of manpower, equipment, and ammunition, and the side that is best able to reconstitute over time can then begin to return to maneuver warfare, create real operational dilemmas for their opponent.\n\nU.S. defense industrial base and, particularly, European defense industrial base has demonstrated that our output is quite low in key areas like artillery ammunition, rocket ammunition, what have you, and that a lot of whats been given is forcibly given out of stockpiles, which is, essentially, pulling out of your ammunition savings account, and that the longer the war goes on the more challenging it is because you begin running out of ammunition at an excessive rate.\n\nThe Russian military also has substantial problems with ammunition. They were heavily reliant on artillery to offset their deficit in manpower in the spring and summer and they had a very high use rate of artillery.\n\nThey came about to mobilizing industrial production quite late in getting equipment out of storage, trying to increase artillery production, and I think theyre going to be facing deficits. In fact, I think that thats probably the biggest issue right now for the Russian military effort and why theyve adopted a defensive strategy writ large trying to entrench for the winter and reconstitute the force. Im quite skeptical in their ability to return offensive potential after the winter, but well see.\n\nRegarding the defense industrial sector overall, so a couple of points here merit mentioning.\n\nThe first is that the Russian defense industrial complex is not autarkic; that is, its not self-sufficient. It is heavily dependent in areas on import of Western componentschips, electronics, key components, maybe, bearings and the like.\n\nThat said, it is relatively more self-sufficient than most other countries because our defense industries are actually heavily intertwined to global supply chains and we also do a lot of co-development.\n\nSo, in that regard, Russia is a lot more self-sufficient than other countries. But its main dependencies will be components and also machine tools. They spent years modernizing and tooling up the defense industry with Western machine tools, in fact, which are, frankly, the best ones, and theyre going to have problems sustaining it over time.\n\nRegarding sanctions, though, and export controls, I think here a lot of the conversation might be overly optimistic(inaudible)not exactly technically sound.\n\nSo, first, sanctions are going to have a very neat effect and quite noticeable effect, as weve seen, on the Russian economy and key commercial sectors that are dependent on foreign imports.\n\nBut its going to take quite a while for them to actually affect Russias defense industrial complex. Many of the stories Ive seen early on in spring and summer, Im sorry, I just dont believe them to be true, and weve seen the Russian defense industry deliver batches of equipment throughout this year. So a lot of this is a very low information environment.\n\nHeres the reality. I think export controls over timeand over time I mean over the course of years, not over the course of monthslike, these are effects you are not going to be seeing within the span of eight months.\n\nIm sorry. Nobodys just operating on a two-month supply of chips in the defense industry in the Russian military. Thats very unlikely. At least thats my opinion.\n\nThat export controls will substantially constrain their access to these components. They will have to find workarounds.\n\nNow, Russia, like countries, lets say, such as Iran, is rather well practiced at trying to get around export controls and importing chips through fake end-user certificates, shell companies, and what have you.\n\nIn fact, we now have the opportunity to pull apart Iranian weapons that Russia is using, their drones. And theyre actually quite full of U.S. chips, too, and theyve been one the longest sanctioned countries in the world. And its a very mixed story in terms of efficacy of export controls because they come down to enforcement.\n\nSo Ill wrap up on this. The more expansive the sanctions regime the more difficult it is to enforce, the more it becomes a question of enforcement and playing a bit of a game of whack-a-mole with the Russian military and Russian intelligence community thats trying to get around export controls.\n\nI think you should appreciate that these things arent talismanic, meaning they dont magically cut Russia off of access to chips and technologies. They make it much longer and much more costlier for Russia to acquire these technologies, but you should have some, well say, moderate expectations of the downstream effects.\n\nBRANNEN: OK.\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: Kate, Ill just jump in really quick, too, just to highlight the point because you mentioned it too and Mike touched on it a little bit, which is the concern about U.S. and European defense industrial base and our ability to sustain weapons to Ukraine.\n\nI mean, we are facing a lot of challenges in that regard and I think theres two key problems that I keep hearing regularly.\n\nOne is kind of the U.S. contracts. I heard anecdotally that after the White House announced that they would provide the NASAMS to Ukraine it took more than six months to actually get the contract signed and that production line going.\n\nAnd then, similarly, you hear a lot about our defense companies not having the horizon, not having confidence that the orders will keep coming, and so theyre not willing to make the costly investments to add new supply lines and other things that are going to be needed in order to sustain the weapons.\n\nSo Mikes right. Like, Russia will have some challenges on the defense side. But it is a major focus, I think, right, in this current moment for both the United States and the Europeans. We recognize its a challenge, and everyone is trying to figure out what it will take in order to be able to sustain the weapons that willthat Ukraine needs in order to stay on the fight and reclaim territory.\n\nBRANNEN: While you bring that up, I wanted to talk a little bit about the U.S. midterms and the American political picture because its directly tied to American staying power in Ukraine, and the inability of defense contractors to plan out, like, largely, depends on this political question in the United States and how long the U.S. will support Ukraine and whether it will wobble at all.\n\nAny sense from the results of the midterms? You know, there was not this red wave, which, to some people, predicted, you know, perhaps, more scrutiny on Ukraine aid.\n\nIs there a sense of relief now that that hasnt happened from our allies or from Ukrainians themselves? Is there anything on that front that you could shed light on?\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: Yeah. I think theres definitely relief that you hear from allies and also the Ukrainians.\n\nBut I still think we have a near-term/long-term problem. So, in the near term, I feel really confident that the United States and with this Congress will be able to sustain support for Ukraine.\n\nAhead of the elections there were some kind of perilous moments, right, when you had McCarthy with his statement that the United States wouldnt provide a blank check, and then on the Democratic side on the far left the letter that came out that was also kind of pushing towards negotiations.\n\nI think what was notable about both of those things is McCarthy kind of had to walk back his statements and, clearly, the Democratic caucus quickly rescinded its letter. So that, I think, inspired some hope.\n\nBut with this outcome, it seems to me that at least U.S. support on thesorry, on the military support to Ukraine will remain strong and robust. That seems to be where there is extremely strong bipartisan consensus that we need to continue to sustain the military aid.\n\nI think where I get a little bit more nervous is on the economic aid front, and I think that is likely to be a bit more of a challenge. I think you will, even though the Dems hold the Senate and the House, youre going to hear more and more about oversight and, you know, like, thats what was behind McCarthys statements, in many ways. More about oversight, more about anti-corruption, making sure American tax dollars are being spent adequately.\n\nAnd the other thing that Im a bit concerned about, too, is there is a widening gap between what the United States is providing in terms of economic support to Ukraine and what the Europeans are providing, and I think I am surprised, honestly, that some of the kind of Trumpian Republicans havent pounced on this more to say that, you know, our allies arent pulling their fair share. This is a war thats happening in Europewhy arent they doing more.\n\nSo I do think its plausible that this canthis might become the new 2 percent where you see some Republicans kind of bashing allies for not doing enough. So thoughbut in the near term, dollar amounts on military aid I feel good about. I worry more on the economic aid front.\n\nBut we do have this looming concern over the longer term in terms of what happens with the elections and, obviously, Putin and others are watching very closely because it is possible, it is plausible, that if Trump were to re-announce and win or another Trump-like candidate that that kind of support for Ukraine could be reversed.\n\nSo I guess thatsits a good news story in the near term with still a lot of question marks in the longer term.\n\nBRANNEN: Mmm hmm. To go back to sort of assessing Russian power, I wanted to ask you, Andrea, a little bit about Russian economic power and political power.\n\nAt the beginning of the war there were really dire predictions about what would happen to the Russian economy in the near term as these sort of new sanctions were being leveled upon the Russian government.\n\nHow do you assessits, definitely, a murkier picture, I feel like, than the military itself. But how do you assess the state of the Russian economy right now and how it relates to its power in the world?\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: Well, Mike, touched on some of this with the sanctions and export controls.\n\nBut youre right, I think the Russian economythe World Bank adjusted its assessment for this year that the Russian economy would contract by just 6 percent and, by comparison, I think Ukraine is something like 35 (percent) to 40 percent its GDP will shrink.\n\nSo I think in the immediate the sanctions and export controls didnt have the impact that many hoped that it would. But over the long term, as the points that Mike made, the sanctions and the export controls, in particular, are likely to continue to constrict and constrain Russia on the economic front and, certainly, all of the steps that Europe is taking to diversify its energy dependence away from Russia over the long term will significantly weaken Russia economically and take away a key source of leverage that the Russians have been able to have and use regularly over the Europeans. So I doI think its a bit of a mixed picture.\n\nThe other point we make in the article is that Russia has never been an economic powerhouse and, yet, its always been able to threaten and disrupt and challenge U.S. interests.\n\nThe other key point that we make, too, I think, is that the more isolated that Russia is economically, the less of a stakeholder it is in the rules of the game, the more kind of emboldened it is to be disruptive, and I think those are the key points.\n\nSo on all of these things, whether its the military, the economy, yes, of course, Russia is going to emerge from this weakened on both of those fronts. But it still retains important capabilities that the United States has to pay attention to.\n\nI guess, and Iand maybe just the final point is, I think, for us that was the point of this article is, number one, kind of in the immediate aftermath of the conflict we saw a lot of experts and analysts in the community starting to significantly wave off Russia as a challenge, basically, saying, well, if they cant even beat the Ukrainians then, really, the United States and Europe dont need to worry about Russia.\n\nSo that was one. We wanted to speak to that and, I think, have a more nuanced assessment.\n\nAnd then the other point of this article is this war really shook the foundations of the Russia community and the way that we understood the Russia challenge, and so we saw this article as beginning the conversation of trying to evaluate, well, now what is the nature of the Russia challenge because we dont want to overwe dont want to underestimate Russia\n\nBRANNEN: Right.\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: because that creates all sorts of risks and challenges. But nor do we want to overestimate what it is because we recognize with China and climate change theres so many competing challenges.\n\nSo we wanted to start the conversation of trying to understand now, given what has happened in Ukraine, what is the nature of this Russian threat.\n\nBRANNEN: Yeah. It does feel like Americans have real whiplash when it comes to the Russian threat. Its either this, like, mastermind genius whos, you know, changing elections here in the United States or its, you know, a complete fool whos humiliated itself on the battlefield, and it does feel like we cant right size that threat properly.\n\nMichael, Im curious. I know you were in Ukraine recently. Do the Ukrainians see Russia clearly or do theyis there thatis there any level of complacency there?\n\nKOFMAN: No. I think, if anything, theyre actually less complacent than we are here and less consuming of the victory narrative, right, which is the distinction between Ukraine is winning and it has the initiative and is doing quite well versus it has already won, which is a sentiment you often get on social media and, actually, not just social media, regular media.\n\nI think in Ukraine the approach is much more sober minded, understanding that this is a conflict thats likely to go on. Ukraine is, certainly, winning but a lot of its effort hinges on external material assistance, on the material availability and the policy to make it available, particularly in the United States. I wouldnt say the United States is the only factor but, to be frank, I think its the number-one significant variable.\n\nAnd also many European countriestheir policies or support are reactive to the U.S. policy as they look to see to what extent the U.S. is willing to give something to see if theyre also going to contribute.\n\nAnd I think in Ukraine the views are real optimistic, but often defense establishments have to plan for a worst case scenario. So I think there they dont find Russian mobilization, even with all the problems it has had visibly, to be a laughing matter.\n\nThere, they understand that the Russian military was able to conduct an orderly withdrawal of most of its forces from Kherson. Its a major strategic victory from Ukraine, but they realize theyll have to face those forces again on another front and that the Russian plan is to try to extend the war and push the war well into next year while attempting to destroy Ukrainian critical infrastructure, right, to raise the economic toll and to increase the number of refugees.\n\nAnd so, I think, in Ukraine my impression is that of a well-motivated military and dealing with folks who very much think theyre winning but are also quite realistic about how much more there is to do, right, and not quite as optimistic that, you know, these last two victories mean that its going to be a short war or that its going to be an easy one.\n\nActually, the campaign in Kherson was quite costly. It was a grinding attritional battle. And also understanding that theres still a fair deal of uncertainty in terms of whether the Russian military could stabilize its lines, whether it could entrench over the course of the winter and how that campaign can go, and the Russian strike campaign and its attempt to whittle away the Ukrainian economy.\n\nBRANNEN: I want to shift gears to the discussions of negotiations.\n\nAndrea, you mentioned the Progressive Caucus letter that came out at the end of October. It was quickly walked back and the people who signed it disavowed it.\n\nBut, recently, just this week, you have General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, telling an audience in New York that the winter is really a momenta windowto seize and to get both sides to the negotiating table.\n\nAgain, the Biden administration has distanced itself from these comments. Its difficult to tell whats exactly going on there. But whats your take on this larger discussion about negotiations and whether its the proper time now or whether, you know, with Ukraine winning on the battlefield its really not the moment?\n\nWhat is your take on that?\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: It is absolutely not the moment, and I think, if anything, we should be having a discussion about how the United States and Europe can lean in in the wake of the victory in Kherson to push even harder.\n\nI think MikeI mean, Mike just gave a good summary of where things are. I mean, the risk is now that after this victory subsequent victories for Ukraine could become ever more difficult as Russian forces are kind of consolidated and as they build up their defensive lines.\n\nAnd so what wed want to prevent happening is this moving into a stalemate that drags on for a very long time. Thats not in the U.S. interest. It will increase the costs of sustaining a very long war. It increase the cost that we will have to pay eventually to rebuild and reconstruct Ukraine, and it creates really significant risks to Western cohesion, which up until this point has been impressive. But the longer this goes the greater the risks become.\n\nSo it is absolutely not the right time to be talking about any sort of negotiations, and Mike makes this point regularly that, certainly, any ceasefire would just be used by Russia to reconstitute forces and they would come back at another time.\n\nSo I think thats where we are, and I would say from the Russian side, today, we should note, a hundred missiles launched and lobbed into Ukraine again. That, certainly, is not a signal of a side thats ready and willing and genuine about any sort of negotiation.\n\nSo I dont know exactly where the administration is. I agree, it is confusing with a lot of mixed signals. My sense is what you said, Kate, is that the White House in particular is trying to distance itself from Milleys statements recently, reiterating that now is not the time for negotiations.\n\nAnd so my sense is thats where the White House is. But, again, its really hard to tell. But I think my sense and my opinion, my view, my assessment, is that now is, certainly, not the time for any sort of negotiations.\n\nKOFMAN: Yeah. If I could just, maybe, briefly add to Andreas comment.\n\nI think its important to consider that usually in a war if you want to have negotiations for a cease-fire youre looking for one of two things and neither of them are present in this situation.\n\nThe first is a military stalemate, which doesnt exist. Ukrainians are actually winning, and if youre trying to impose a ceasefire its only going to benefit Russia, which desperately needs several months to try to reconstitute its forces. That is the Russian strategy, moving forward. But then it wouldthey would only renew the war.\n\nThe second is either side being willing to revise their minimal war aims, which neither is willing to do. Theyre irreconcilable. And Vladimir Putin, by going through with annexation, has essentially severed his ability to revise his minimal war aims; that is, theres not much for him and Ukrainians to talk about after his annexation of Ukrainian territory, right? What the settlement point is now is profoundly unclear.\n\nSo, from my point of view, that entire conversation is very much premature and its not aligned with Ukrainian sentiments at all and the Ukrainian approach in this war. So Ill leave it at that.\n\nIts notIm not being sort of performatively hawkish and saying theres no space for negotiations. Many wars end with negotiated settlements, even when one side is, clearly, defeated. Its just this doesnt look like the time for it and a lot of conversations are really premature.\n\nBRANNEN: Michael, just to think a little bit about what happens next, what does control of Kherson and acquiring it in the way that it did, you know, without as big a fight, maybe, as some expectedwhat does it set Ukraine up to do next?\n\nKOFMAN: So, realistically, taking Kherson allows Ukraine to move up long-range artillery fire to range a lot of the southern occupied territory. Not down to Crimea, but it also allows them to now free all those forces that were deployed on a very large front in Kherson and, perhaps, displace them to a different part of the battlefield.\n\nThe most important aspect of this victory is that it eliminates the prospect for a future Russian campaign along the southern coast because Russia no longer has a foothold west of the Dnieper River. So it no longer has the opportunity to try to pursue a future campaign towards Mykolaiv or Odessa, right.\n\nI think now Ukraine has a number of options regarding what they might want to do, right. They have the freedom of maneuver. They have interior lines. That is, its much easier for them to shift forces within Ukraine than it is for Russia to shift forces around Ukraine between different fronts.\n\nThey can now move them to the Donetsk or Luhansk, or they can work to reconstitute forces and prepare for a major offensive in the south, maybe, in the future. Im not going to speculate.\n\nRegarding the kind of immediate military outcome, yet to see. So the Dnieper River is a significant natural barrier. It is not an insurmountable barrier but it is a big natural barrier and its clear that the Russian militarys plan is to try to, essentially, fortify behind it, right, and shift forces further east and try to consolidate defensive lines, at least for the next several months.\n\nAnd Ukraines military strategy, from what I can tell, is to try to disrupt the reconstitution of the Russian forces over the winter. That is, to keep up the pressure, to increase the level of attrition because Ukraine does have a qualitative advantage in the kind of artillery and arms it is using, right, and to keep the battlefield dynamicto keep it from sort of freezing and trenching behind which Russia can use this time period to raise the manning level tables in its forces, to build out reserves, to rotate troops, and try to fix many of the problems in its military over the next four months, right.\n\nSo even though as winter loomsits actually the worst in November and December because its cold and muddy and rainythe battlefield itself, you know, its not going toits not going to become stalemated or necessarily stagnant, even though the weather itself is probably prohibitive towards large-scale military offenses. It usually is.\n\nBRANNEN: OK.\n\nAndrea, did you want to add anything? If not, well go toat this point, well go to audience questions. I could talk to you guys for much longer but I dont want to hog the mic.\n\nSo, Sam, Ill hand it over to you to start taking questions from our audience.\n\nOPERATOR: (Gives queuing instructions.)\n\nOur first question is a written submission from Aaron Kaye (sp), who asks: November has been pretty mild so far. But as winter goes on what are some of the key things Ukraine will really need to get through the winter? Are the nearly daily attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure having the desired effects and how much more can Ukraine sustain?\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: Mike, do you want to jump in orI mean, I guessI mean, its clear thatyou know, I think its $4 billion a month or something that Ukraine requires in order to keep its budget afloat.\n\nSo, yes, it is necessary. It is urgent that the United States and Europe continue to provide economic aid to Ukrainians.\n\nThey are asking for things like generators and batteries and other things to try to alleviate some of the hardship that the Ukrainian citizens will face. So there, certainly, is a whole host of economic support that it will be necessary for the United States and Europe to sustain.\n\nAnd then on the military frontand Mike can chime in on thisI think what you continue to hear from the Ukrainians in terms of what they need is, number one, the air defenses. That is one way that the Ukrainians can continue to keep their citizens safe in cities. So that is key to protecting electrical grids and heating and power and water. So air defenses are critical.\n\nThe other thing that President Zelensky talks very frequently about is armored vehicles and tanks and other things that they will need in order to retake territory. He also talks about needing them in large enough numbers so that entire kind of units can be equipped with the same tank because one of the challenges that they face is that they have a hodgepodge of different equipment, which makes maintenance for them really difficult.\n\nAnd then the other thing that they hear regularly is the long-range artillery, and ATACMS continues to be at the top of their list and, again, helping Ukrainiansnot being by any means a silver bullet in what they need but allowing them to strike more deeply into Russian-held territory is another way that, I think, you could kind of disrupt the potential current stalemate.\n\nSo both on the economic aid front but also this laundry list of things that the Ukrainians are asking for is another way that the United States and the West can ensureagain, I think the goal at this point is to accelerate the end of the war.\n\nAgain, its in the United States interest that we can end the war as quickly as possible rather than having this get into a prolonged conflict that, as I said, will raise the costs both of sustaining it, of rebuilding Ukraine, and risks breaking up Western unity.\n\nSo its really critical that the United States and Europe do the most that they can to sustain aid on both those fronts.\n\nOPERATOR: We will take our next question from Kimberly Marten.\n\nQ: Thank you so much. This was a terrific discussion and, as always, I really enjoy learning from both of you.\n\nThis is, maybe, a follow-up onto the statements that Andrea has made. How do you see this war ending? How should we expect things would change in Russia to get Russia to stop fighting? What is going to happen in Russia when this war ends?\n\nI mean, it justI know this is a question that gets asked a lot. But assuming that U.S. and Western weapons support continues to be flexible but at the same kind of level it is where it is, basically, designed to limit the Ukrainian ability to attack Russian territory and so it is designed to allow Ukraine to regain territory, do we see a future in which Putin just says, I give up, I lost, and thats the end of it? Thanks.\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: Mike, Im sure youll have thoughts, too.\n\nI mean, I cant imagine that Putin would terminate the war by choice, and I think theres some interesting research that was, I dont know, published a month or so ago on War on the Rocks that I found especially interesting that was a comparative look at war termination, and Im forgetting the authors name.\n\nBut it is extremely infrequent when you look across wars that the leader who started a war would end the war, and even though kind of leadership turnover can facilitate war termination, this scholar found that even then a leader that inherits the war is often bound by the same kind of ideas, the same kind of risks of blame, that the previous leader, especially if that leader comes from within the inner circle, rightso that even war termination under afor a leader who inherits the war is also not as high as we might expect.\n\nSo thats number one is I cant really imagine a scenario in which Putin accepts something that is quite clearly a loss for Russia. I think he would rather drag this out and have a prolonged war so that he doesnt have to reckon with the consequences.\n\nI think for Putin it would be better for this to drag on than him to kind of pull out with a clear defeat because I do think that could potentially be destabilizing. So its still really hard for me to imagine exactly how this ends.\n\nIn an ideal world, I think we should be pushing for Ukraine to retake all of its territory, at least to the east. Crimea is another question, and I know thats where a lot of the most contention arises.\n\nBut it seems to me a realistic solution to that is if Ukraine can retake its territory there could be a way to at least have Western leaders come out to say that they recognize that Ukrainethat Crimea is Ukrainian but that they kind of kick the can down the road with an agreement to negotiate about its status at a later date.\n\nTo me, that seems like the best possible outcome. It is, at least where we are today, feels like a long way away. But given some of the recent Ukrainian victories, I dont think we can rule out that we could get there at some point.\n\nBut, Mike, I dont know if you have different thoughts.\n\nKOFMAN: Yeah. So I think its a great question. Thanks for asking that.\n\nSo I would say the honest answer is I dont know how this war necessarily ends. The challenge with wars is that its difficult to see inflection points except in hindsight, and you often have a bias whenever youre in a war in assuming that the war is going to go on the way it has in whatever phase youre currently observing, and wars tend not to work that way. So you tend to linearly sort of extrapolate and have the status quo bias about how a war can continue.\n\nSo thats kind of the challenge of trying to see the future. But I can see one outcome where the Ukrainian military is successful enough to pressure Russia to revise its minimal war aims. That might be an optimistic scenario.\n\nI could see another one where the war is a sustained conflict and even though Russia has no prospect for winning Putin, simply, is unwilling to end the war. And one of the annoying things about wars is its typically up to the loser to decide when the war is over, and Russia can, simply, not acknowledge military defeat and keep the war going via various means like the strikes you saw today, right.\n\nEven if there are no Russian soldiers on the battlefield Russia can keep the war going as it makes more missiles. It couldlets imagine a pessimistic scenario so we have a realistic discussion and its not all rosy eyed.\n\nYou know, it could be a negative-sum game where a strategic defeat for Russia is not necessarily a victory for Ukraine. A lot of people assume that one means the other but it does not. Or Ukraine could be incredibly successful but the result is something that leads to nuclear escalation, which, I think, weighs very much on the minds of folks in Washington, D.C. Yeah, theres a desire for an accelerated victory, but also you hear a lot of concerns about the implications of that as well for the imperative of escalation management.\n\nIm not necessarily saying what I think. Im just saying what I think people who are in a position to actually make decisions on these subjects think in this city. And there are lots of events that could be unforeseen. You know, you could have a cascade failure of the Russian military; a collapse resulting from a Ukrainian breakthrough. You could have a tremendous drop in morale over the course of the winter amongst mobilized personnel and have a part of the line fail, right.\n\nSo these sort of serendipitous events that you can imagine but may not necessarily predict and they then put parties into a position where they have to make decisions they might not have otherwise anticipated.\n\nSo, sorry, thats not a satisfying answer. I often give unsatisfying answers to these questions. But at least it helps, I think, map out the range of possibilities.\n\nOPERATOR: Our next question is a written submission from William Wye (sp), who asks: What can Taiwan learn from Russias invasion of Ukraine as it faces a possible invasion from the Chinese?\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: Mike, thats all you. Thats a military question. (Laughs.)\n\nKOFMAN: Yeah. Well, be very careful in generalizing from a context. I always warn people at first people like to strip away the context of a particular war and try to figure out lessons for their own situation.\n\nBut military power and how it expresses itself is very context dependent. And the second part Id say is that, oftentimes, early on in a war you learn a lot of things that arent true. Most of the early lessons are wrong, just to be frank. Theyre based on very incomplete information and kind of tangential takes, and it takes time to actually figure out what happened in the war. You know, I tell people we still debate over what happened in World War I and why. So you have to manage your expectations about eight months into this war that youve got the lessons down as to what actually took place and what it means.\n\nI guess my takeaway would be that certainly a concerted defense, leveraging urban terrain as possible, those were biga big part of the Ukrainian success story early on. However, this was very much a conventional artillery war and its a war with a lot of technology that you might have seen being demonstrated online in social media is not really the capability thats been most decisive.\n\nId say the big lesson is going to be pretty boring. First, a lot of major conventional wars, beyond the initial operation, come down to attrition, as I described before.\n\nSecond, much of it has to do with a countrys ability to withstand the initial blow, prove resilient, and thats a question about force structure and the amount of hedge you built in. Thats actually, to me, often the most interesting thing.\n\nI find capability discussions technically fascinating but intellectually often very boring because force structure and force design is going to reveal a lot more about how a military is going to fight and the strategic choices they made than which anti-tank missile they ended up buying at the end of the day. OK.\n\nBeyond that, capacity and being prepared for a war of attrition. Wars like this very rapidly consume your equipment and your best capabilities. And the question is how much hedge have you sort of built into your force, right, your ability to sustain that fight.\n\nBut the contexts are very different, right. Like, a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan is going to be rather different than the context youve seen of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, and also keep in mind that the initial Russian operation was a regime change operation rather than a combined arms operation with good planning, prepared forces who actually expected to fight and were going to make the Ukrainian military the center of gravity in the assault. Thats not what took place in this war.\n\nFortunately, it did, right. It made the Ukrainian task of defending much easier. I dont think Taiwan is going to have that luxury, to be perfectly honest. But, of course, they have certain other advantages being a fairly large island with complex terrain relative to China.\n\nSo we can keep going on this question. The one thing I will say is that what you definitely see is the supremacy of the political in war and political assumptions in driving a military campaign, the fact that it will affect the concept of operation. There isnt this sort of air gap between professional military planning and the assumptions of a political leadership when they actually decide to use force, and you see that consistently and you see that demonstrated in this war.\n\nAnd, second, that things in war go wrong very, very quickly and they often go wrong, actually, on both sides, right, and the side thats best able to recover from thatfrom those initial assumptions going wrong is often the one that stands a better chance of prevailing over time.\n\nAnd the last point is quantity and quality are significant but theres nothing more deterministic than force employmenthow you actually use those capabilities and what the military strategy is.\n\nOPERATOR: Our next question will be a live question from Amy Austin Holmes.\n\nQ: Hi. Thank you very much for this fascinating discussion. Im an international affairs fellow at CFR.\n\nMy question is how you thinkhow both of you assess the Russian war in Ukraine has impacted Russian capabilities, particularly in Syria. The New York Times reported last month that Russia withdrew an air defense system and some of its troops from Syria to Ukraine. There was speculation as to the number of troops, whether it was two battalions or more. But Id be interested to hear if you have any thoughts on how the war has impacted Russian capabilities elsewhere, particularly in Syria. Thank you.\n\nKOFMAN: Well, I think the war, overall, has put a huge strain on the Russian force, right, and on ability to sustain operations distant from the Russian border. I mean, for one, theres just simple military transit problem where Russia has to primarily resupply Syria or change force posture by airlift.\n\nI think that the war has consumed the better part of the active force. Its consumed a lot of the equipment, the volunteer units as well, and its led Russia to really rethink parts of the force posture its had abroad.\n\nBut I dont read anything to withdrawal of an S-300 battery. Russia has countless S-300 air defense units and has a lot of ammunition for them. And why that was moved, you know, these are small tactical events. To be honest, I dont see them with major strategic significance. I dont read anything into it, to be perfectly frank, and I dont try to fill that uncertainty with, like, speculation.\n\nSo, from my point of view, it doesnt matter that much. I dont think Russia is going to withdraw from Syria. It may downsize its footprint there by a meaningless amount of forces. But the Russian footprint in Syria is very small to begin with. There was always one mixed aviation regiment with some force protection around it and a limited ground presence and, typically, it never exceeded six thousand troops, and probably right now its quite short of that.\n\nSo I dont see that sort of as being a big buildup either way.\n\nOPERATOR: Our next question is a written submission from Hale Marku (ph), who asks: What do you make of the recent speculation about the U.S. admin urging Kyiv to be open to negotiations? What is your read on Jake Sullivans visit to Kyiv and CIA director to Turkey, where he met with his Russian counterpart?\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: So, Kate, you touched on that a little bit with your questions.\n\nBut I think on theencouraging the Ukrainians to be open to negotiations, in particular, to me, I think, that the administration is worried about cohesion, worried about sustaining support for Ukraine over the long term.\n\nAnd so my best guess is that theyyou know, Zelensky had made the statement that he isnt willing to negotiate with Putin and only with a future Russian leader, and I think the administration was concerned that that very definitive hard line position could alienate support, allow kind of third world countries, onlooking countries, to shift blame to Ukraine for the prolongation of the war.\n\nSo I think thats what I read into it is an effort by the United States to try to sustain as broad of a coalition of support as possible for the Ukrainians.\n\nAnd then on the negotiations with Bill Burns and Turkey, again, its really hard to know exactly what those are. I dont think were necessarily getting the full story behind all of that. You know, obviously, the administration has tried to sell it as Bill Burns warning the Russians about what would happen in the event that Russia used nuclear weapons.\n\nIm not sure thats all there is there. But, again, the fact that a day after the meeting Russia launched a hundred missiles on Ukraine doesnt suggest that those talks were going particularly well and that they were producing anything fruitful.\n\nSo I think thats where we are.\n\nOPERATOR: Our next question will be from Mark Hannah.\n\nQ: Hi. What a fascinating conversation. Thank you. Mark Hannah with the Eurasia Group Foundation.\n\nId love for you to just sort of rank what you think U.S. war aims should be. I know that were not officially, you know, party to this conflict butand, certainly, American interests arent completely aligned with Ukrainian interests here. They deviate in various ways.\n\nBut in terms of just, you know, avoiding escalation with nucleara nuclear-armed power versus protecting the Ukrainian people versus preserving democracy or territorial integrity, what do you think? There hasnt been a clear articulation of what are the primary goals here and Id love to hear from you guys what you think they are.\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: I can jump on that and then see if Mike has anything to add.\n\nI mean, I think, number one, first and foremost, is to support Ukraine to get to a, quote/unquote, \"Ukrainian victory\" however we might define that and to ensure as the administration continues to say that Ukraine is in as strong a position as possible once they eventually do get to the negotiating table. So I think thats kind of priority number two.\n\nWhen you look at other objectives, I think the United States is looking to minimize the impact of the war on the rest of the world so, certainly, things like the green deal, the energy shocks, and other things. I think one of the goals is to maintain cohesive allied support for Ukraine to ensure that this doesnt become a divisive issue.\n\nObviously, as you said, one of the key goals, and as Mike alluded to weighs heavily on the minds of the U.S. administration, is to prevent any direct military conflict between the United States and Europe. I think its to increase the strength of NATO. I guess that could fall under the kind of whatyou know, the cohesive and strong allies.\n\nIts to help the Europeans accelerate their energy independence from Russia and to ensure, I think, one of the goalsand, obviously, theres been debate about how to articulate this appropriately in publicis to diminish Russia, and, you know, Milley came out to say, you know, that the United States wants to weaken Russia. That elicited a lot of backlash.\n\nBut I do believe that one of the goals of the administration is to ensure that Russia cant continue and return to aggression beyond its borders.\n\nSo I think there is a long list of goals. Obviously, support for Ukraine and getting to Ukrainian victory is at the top of that, and Iand, again, minimizing the impact of the war.\n\nI think theres another one you would put in there on kind of in between states and ensuring the broadest coalition of support possible and ensuring that some countries like India and others that have been on the fence continue to move in the direction of the United States rather than sitting on the fence.\n\nSo I do think that theres a long list of goals. But I agree its been a while since the administration has been out to articulate what the goals are. I think the last we heard from President Biden was his op-ed back in July. And I think a lot of us have this feeling like we arethe United States is outsourcing our foreign policy to the Ukrainians.\n\nBut I think when you get a U.S. official in the room those are the things that they would be able to articulate. I do think that they are operating from a fairly clear list of goals that they all understand internally.\n\nBut I think theyre falling short on being able to articulate that to the public. So that would be what I put on my list as what the goals are.\n\nOPERATOR: Our next question is a written submission from Mona Yacoubian, who asks: Is there a danger of falling into an escalatory cycle of continuing to push for additional military gains and, in effect, ending up in a long-term war of attrition rather than accelerating the end of the war, as desired? Is it not possible to prepare the way for negotiations while continuing the fight on the ground?\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: Mike, do you want to jump on that?\n\nI guessand I want to add one goal, which is a China-related goal, and I think, again, the United States is trying to ensure that China rethinks its position on Russia. I think thats something else the administration would say.\n\nBut, Mike, I dont know if you want to answer this question. I can jump on it after you.\n\nKOFMAN: Yeah. Im not sure I fully understand the question, to be honest.\n\nI mean, I dont see escalation as necessarily tied to the phasing of the warhow its progressing, right. Escalation is probably derivative of the two sides red lines and, you know, theyre either crossed or theyre not, and whether you cross them through one military strategy or another, I dont think, really matters all that much.\n\nI think escalation management is an imperative but its not disarming one. The U.S. has been pretty successful in supporting Ukraines military efforts while also managing escalation and so far thats actually gone pretty well. Not to say that its going to continue that way.\n\nIm not sure that theres much meaning in discussing short war, long war, accelerated or not. Like, Ukraine is not fighting this war intentionally slowly, if thats what people think. Thats not whats taking place, right.\n\nSo the war is going, I think, about as fast as it could go with the provision of U.S. arms and U.S. ammunition thats being provided already, I think, at a rate thats not necessarily sustainable.\n\nSo the U.S. is actually trying to ramp up production of ammunition as are European countries. Folks seem to appreciate that, that its not like the war is going this way for lack of trying.\n\nIm not sure what else to add to it. Like, I think Mona has a good question. I think its very much up to the Ukrainians, to be perfectly honest, and its up to the military strategy that they want to pursue and howyou know, how they want to approach the war.\n\nQ: Can I ask a quick follow-up?\n\nIs there a disconnect between Washington and Kyiv about escalation? Are there red lines that the Ukrainians are willing to cross or explore that the Americans are not? Or are they on the same page on that?\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: I think thats hard to say. I mean, certainly, Crimea is going to be a major issue at some point and I think thats where youre likely to see the most divergence between the Ukrainian position and the U.S., as currently stated.\n\nSo, right now, Ukraines war aims are to restore its territorial integrity to the, you knowto its original lines and that includes Crimea. I think theres going to be a lot of heartburn in Washington over what to do in Crimea.\n\nBut there are small little issues. So, like, the ATACMS are a good example. Obviously, the Ukrainians want the ability to hit further with precise strikes. The United States is very concerned that Ukraine would use those to strike into Russian territory.\n\nThe Ukrainians are trying to mitigate, where they can, the divergence by saying to the United States, well, if you give us the ATACMS we promise that we will kind of get your preapproval on any targets that we seek to strike using those.\n\nSo, I think, there are, I think, small points of difference that the Ukrainians recognize and are looking for creative solutions to minimize that difference.\n\nBut over the long term, I think Crimea is going to be the key area where, if we were to get to that point where Ukraine was actually seriously looking to retake territory in Crimea, that the United States could end up pressuring the Ukrainians not to move in that direction and, again, encouraging them to kick that can down the road as part of a future discussion while recognizing that our position is unchanged, that we still view Crimea as part of Ukraine but it might not need to be settled immediately.\n\nSo, I think, little points of friction. Generally, on the same page, except if we get to that point where we have to discuss Crimea.\n\nI dont know. Mike, agree? Disagree?\n\nKOFMAN: Yeah, I agree. I just think that theheres my view of it.\n\nI think that the more that Ukraine is successful on the battlefield, right, and the more territory that it regains and the better its position down the line, the greater, potentially, the risk of escalation, and thats when over time you can get misalignment or much less alignment on how this war ends.\n\nBut my personal view is that that is all a good problem to have. OK. Brilliant discussion. Lets get it there and then have a conversation on how to realign those things. But were not there yet.\n\nSo I see, like, a lot of premature conversations on the basis of what happened in Kharkiv, which is not a model for how this war is going to go, and then based on what happened in Kherson, which Im not sure is fully understood yet.\n\nSo I think its best to actually be in a place where you can have the happy problem of discussing misalignment from policy success.\n\nBRANNEN: I think we have time for one or two more questions, Sam.\n\nOPERATOR: We will take our next question from Tom Davis.\n\nQ: Hello. Its a great discussion.\n\nTom Davis, former Army artillery officer and at one time the chief of the nonstrategic nuclear forces branch on the joint staff.\n\nI think Andrea is the only one whos mentioned the nuclear component of this. So I have, basically, a two-point question.\n\nDo we really have to have a serious concern about a desperate Putin doing a desperate thing and resorting to some sort of battlefield nuclear or tactical nuclear weapon?\n\nAnd, secondly, to turn around Williams question earlier for Michael, what might the Chinesethe Peoples Republichave learned from this conflict?\n\nKENDALL-TAYLOR: Ill weigh in first.\n\nI mean, I do think we have to worry about the risk of nuclear escalation, and Mike was getting at this. The better that Ukraine does on the battlefield the greater the risk of that type of escalation grows in the long term. And I say thatI mean, I know that theres a lot of people who are making the argument that were overstating the risk of nuclear and that then kind ofwere self-restraining because were overstating the risk of that.\n\nBut I think its really hard to know, right. I mean, and so a couple of things that stick out to me for why its plausible that Putin would go there is, first and foremost, like, if he gets to the point where he believes that his own regimes survival is at stake. I think thats the only case.\n\nI dont see him using this to shift tides on the battlefield because, as you rightly said, it doesnt have much utility on the battlefield. But I can imagine a scenario in which Putin feels like he is at risk of being ousted because of a glaring failure in Ukraine and kind of sends up a hail Mary, to use a sports metaphor, in order to try to kind of preempt that outcome.\n\nAnd the reason I say that is, I mean, just from studying authoritarian regimes, when these leaders exit office its these highly personalized autocrats who face the most risk of being either killed, exiled, or jailed. So they face the worst fate once they are ousted from office.\n\nSo, for Putin, I think he equates the risk of being ousted as a result of his failure in Ukraine with his own survival and thats kind of the one instance in which I think he could use it. And, again, I dont think he would use it in order to achieve or gain any advantage on the battlefield.\n\nI also think that he might calculate that it would be very divisive to Western cohesion. Perhaps the Germans would respond differently. I dontso maybe he views it as a tool to try to break consensus in the alliance about how to sustain support for Ukraine, moving forward.\n\nSo, again, it is a low probability kind of event and its in that case where Putin feels that his own survival is at stake, that he could go down that path.\n\nKOFMAN: Yeah. Its very real. Like, no one should hand wave away the prospect of nuclear escalation.\n\nIt may not be incredibly high. But after enacting wartime measures and mobilization and going through with annexation, hes fully committed the regime to this war. The war is now going to go on as long as hes in power.\n\nTheres not a lot of ways for him to step back from having launched this and that just suggests that if the worst comes to pass for the Russian military, then the risk of nuclear escalation is not insignificant down the line. Just being perfectly frank. So we should consider it.\n\nHow Russia might employ nuclear weapons, you know, thats a debate. I, actually, dont know why people are so dismissive of battlefield nuclear use. I dont think that Russia would use nuclear weapons in that way.\n\nBut Ive learned a lot of things about nuclear weapons in the last month on the internet that I dont think are true, OK, so to put it politely in that, yeah, nuclear weapons can be used on the battlefield and actually have effects. But putting all that aside, I dont think thats necessarily the right scenario to consider.\n\nOn Chinese lessons, I, honestly, dont know. That will be a tremendous case of intellectual tourism for me not only to wander into what Chinese think but, specifically, what they think about this war, right.\n\nIm willing to just, at best, guess that theyre going to assign a lot of Russian failure to Russian mistakes specific in this context and see their situation as different. I can tell you what lessons I hope they learn, personally, which isnt the question youve asked but might be of relevance.\n\nI hope that they learn the military lesson that, actually, if they cant achieve an isolation of the battlefield early on that the United States remains the most capable military power and could very steadily grind them down.\n\nAnd the second one is that the U.S. holds tremendous structural economic power in the international system and can really put the screws to China. If they take a good look at the sanctions package and the export controls as applied to Russia, I think it should be a very valuable lesson, I hope, of what the United States and other countries might do.\n\nNow, of course, theyll only do it if China intends on something like a major military operation against Taiwan. But I think this should be a valuable lesson. I dont know if thats the one theyll take.\n\nBRANNEN: All right. Sam, is that it for questions?\n\nOPERATOR: I think weve hit the time.\n\nBRANNEN: Yeah.\n\nOPERATOR: Ill turn it back over to you.\n\nBRANNEN: OK.\n\nWell, I just want to thank you both so much for doing this and thank everyone for joining us today. Please find and read our latest November/December 2022 issue, in which youll find both Andrea and Michaels article that they wrote together.\n\nThank you, everybody.\n\n(END)\n\nThis is an uncorrected transcript.",

                "cc_text": "In 2002, U.S. President George W. Bush authorized the first known use of an armed and networked unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone, as it is commonly called, to kill an al-Qaeda leader in Yemen.1 Bushs inaugural use of a drone for the targeted killing of a terrorist set a dangerous precedent. Over 100 countries and many stateless actors now possess drones.2 To contend with the emergence of so-called \"drone warfare,\" the literature has evolved from studying drone proliferation to measuring the effectiveness of strikes to investigating the legal and normative dimensions of these operations. Though the literature has been described as a \"drone-a-rama,\"3 there are nevertheless still several notable gaps.\n\nOne such area that scholars have largely ignored is the moral legitimacy of strikes based on empirical evidence of the publics perceptions.4 Indeed, as Stephen Ceccoli and John Bing have noted, we know \"surprisingly little\" about the publics perceptions of what constitutes legitimate drone strikes,5 despite reoccurring claims that legitimacy is \"central\" to the sustainability of drone warfare.6 Larry Lewis and Diane Vavrichek argue that there has been an \"inadequate consideration of legitimacy\" in drone policy and scholarship.7 Mitt Regan adds that \"there has been little effort to systematically study legitimacy\" in terms of drones.8 This oversight is problematic because the public seems to view some strikes as more morally legitimate than others.9\n\nThe difference in the publics perceived legitimacy of American and French drone strikes in Africa illustrates this puzzling trend. Though both France and the United States have conducted drone strikes in Africa since 2019, a search via LexusNexus of media coverage for these operations shows key differences in the volume and tone of reporting. French strikes receive 60 percent less media coverage than U.S. strikes. Whereas some observers have cautioned that U.S. strikes have unnecessarily harmed Africans,10 others have argued that Frances strikes are necessary for regional security.11 Yet, American and French strikes are conducted on the same continent, against the same threat, and with the same type of drone, and they result in the same outcomes, including civilian casualties. So why does the public seem to perceive Frances drone strikes in Africa as more legitimate than Americas?\n\nThe purpose of this article is to investigate this variation in the publics perceptions of what constitutes a morally legitimate drone strike. Rather than looking at legitimacy in terms of compliance with international law, I treat legitimacy as an empirical or pragmatic phenomenon. This means that, while legitimacy may constitute the subjective beliefs that people have about the appropriateness of wartime action given some rule, it is also testable.12 Regan argues that \"[t]he fact that human judgment is unavoidable does not mean that all analysis is simply the reflection of subjective preferences that cannot be subject to rigorous assessment.\"13 Christina Pan and her coauthors concur, stating that \"legitimacy is a sociological phenomenon, and can only be meaningfully studied in the context of a society and the attitudes of individuals, therein.\"14 Moral rules about legitimacy either prescribe or proscribe behavior to help countries to meet their security objectives while protecting against causing unnecessary harm in war, especially against civilians. They convey rights and obligations for countries that inform the publics perceptions of what is morally legitimate behavior.15\n\nTo the extent that scholars have probed the publics perceptions of what constitutes a morally legitimate strike, they link judgment to one of three moral norms. Some argue that drone warfare is legitimate to the degree that soldiers risk their lives on the battlefield in launching strikes.16 Others contend that the outcome namely increasing safety for soldiers defines the moral status of drone warfare.17 Still others posit that greater jus in bello (justice in war) constraints that prevent civilian casualties help to inform the publics perceptions of what is morally legitimate.18 While useful, these claims reflect at least two important trade-offs. First, scholars often present these explanations for how the public perceives the moral legitimacy of drone warfare as separate and distinct from one another. Second, scholars usually avoid considering rules that may govern how the public adjudicates the moral legitimacy of strikes. In doing so, they cannot adequately account for inconsistencies in the publics perceptions about morally legitimate strikes that are conducted in the same location and that have the same results, including civilian casualties.19\n\nI contend that the public may combine moral norms to cast judgment about drone strikes and that these moral considerations are shaped by variations in why drones are used and how they are constrained. While many scholars have recognized that countries vary in their use of drones,20 few discuss shifts in how countries constrain strikes. I hypothesize that countries use of drones tactically or strategically coupled with how strikes are constrained to protect against civilian casualties unilaterally or multilaterally can shape the publics intuitions about the moral legitimacy of strikes. Use and constraint, then, constitute informal rules that may condition the publics perceptions of morally legitimate drone strikes. Looking at countries varying uses of strikes under different constraints allows us to determine when and how the public emphasizes moral norms that shape perceptions of legitimacy.\n\nIn order to investigate this proposition, I conducted an original survey experiment. The results indicate that the publics perception of what constitutes a morally legitimate drone strike is not reducible to either use or to constraint alone, as is often suggested by scholars working in the classical just war tradition that is based on jus ad bellum (justice of war) and jus in bello (justice in war).21 The results also suggest that at least the appearance of higher external control over a countrys strikes does increase their perceived legitimacy. So much so, in fact, that countries submitting to multilateral constraint when using strikes tactically can be absolved by the public of any moral culpability for civilian casualties. In addition, the publics perception of the moral legitimacy of drone strikes appears not to be a function of soldiers battlefield courage, soldiers safety, or the protection of civilians alone. Rather, why and how a country uses strikes shapes the publics recall of unique combinations of these moral norms. This finding implies that experts who criticize drones as lacking virtue, given the lack of physical courage required to launch a strike, do so based more on anecdote or their own intuitions rather than empirically derived evidence. Finally, key demographic and dispositional variables, including sex, education, belief in the managerial role of great powers for global security, and support for the use of force abroad can also shape the publics perceptions of what constitutes morally legitimate drone strikes.\n\nThe remainder of this article proceeds as follows. I first sketch the three moral norms that form the baseline of scholars understanding of legitimate drone strikes: soldiers physical courage, the protection of soldiers, and the duty to care for civilians, which is often used interchangeably with the protection of civilians on the battlefield. I then define the informal rules of use and constraint and discuss the possible implications of varying why and how countries use and constrain drones on the publics perceptions of morally legitimate drone strikes. Next, I introduce my research design and then present my findings. I conclude by discussing my results, identifying the implications for U.S. drone policy, and making recommendations for future research.\n\nMoral Norms and Drone Warfare\n\nScholars generally link the publics perceptions of what makes drone warfare morally legitimate to one of three moral norms: soldiers physical courage on the battlefield in conducting strikes, the security outcomes of those strikes, and the protection of civilians. This typology raises questions about what a norm is, how we understand a moral norm, where moral norms come from, and how moral norms are enforced. I briefly outline the anatomy of moral norms before introducing courage, security outcomes, and the duty to protect civilians as the normative benchmarks for how scholars interpret legitimate strikes.\n\nNorms are expectations that constitute and regulate behavior.22 A moral norm is a special type of norm that is thought to be independent of political authority, universal in scope, and related to the suffering of others, which is a hallmark feature of war.23 The literature suggests that moral norms can emerge in one of two ways. Those in the nativist camp argue that moral norms are innate to ones psychology.24 Social-relational theorists such as those associated with the \"English School\" contend that the public is socialized to adopt certain behaviors.25\n\nThe latter approach helps us to understand how moral norms are adopted and enforced. Moral norms do not occur spontaneously within cultures. They evolve as acceptable standards of behavior due to interactions between publics within and between countries. Research suggests that moral norms are adopted by political communities through a process referred to as \"localization\" before being reinterpreted and cycled back into international society.26 What this sequence suggests, then, is that moral norms are first \"identified by dedicated psychological processes associated with imitation and social learning, soaked up from observing and participating in the interpersonal interactions of community.\"27 Specifically, this process indicates that there is a system of norms within people that both shapes and is shaped by expectations of acceptable behavior shared among members of a given society. This system of norms helps to define who can be harmed, how they can be harmed, when they can be harmed, and where they can be harmed.28 An appreciation of moral norms and the norm system that resides within individuals helps us to make sense of assumptions that often underlie scholars emphasis on courage, safeguarding soldiers, or protecting civilians to explain legitimate drone warfare.\n\nScholars have identified three main sources of moral legitimacy when it comes to drone strikes. Those who adhere to virtue ethics contend that the moral legitimacy of a strike is shaped by the degree of risk that the attacking countrys soldiers incur on the battlefield, and thus the physical courage they show.29 This moral norm applies to a form of \"mixed\" drone warfare. In this case, countries use strikes in support of patrols and raids conducted by ground forces, both of which expose soldiers to greater physical harm.30 Soldiers liability to be harmed allows war to keep its \"charm\" for theorists of a martial tradition of war that emphasizes hand-to-hand combat as the defining feature of this social institution.31\n\nYet, it may be the case that the public combines moral norms when adjudicating the legitimacy of strikes, even if they are \"morally dumbfounded\" and cannot explain how they formed a judgment.\n\nA consequentialist account of morally legitimate drone warfare considers the outcomes of strikes. There may be different outcomes that guide the publics interpretation of what is morally legitimate. Most consequentialists in drone warfare studies are focused on how to minimize the physical risks to soldiers.32 According both to Erich Reisen and Bradley Strawser, for instance, if a military can use strikes to engage combatants, it has a moral obligation to do so in order to reduce the risk of harm to soldiers.33 This moral norm corresponds to a \"pure\" form of drone warfare that Neil Renic defines as \"UAVs as war, rather than in war.\"34\n\nNon-consequentialist approaches, also referred to as deontologist approaches, emphasize obligations to others. While many obligations may exist, deontologists studying drone warfare generally emphasize the duty to care for civilians as the key moral norm that informs the publics perceptions about drone strike legitimacy. This echoes the jus in bello principle of distinction or non-combatant immunity that most analysts claim is integral to legitimacy.35 These obligations are sometimes discussed in terms of constraints. Chief among these constraints are the reputational costs that countries incur for launching strikes that result in civilian casualties;36 the arguable need for countries to demonstrate the military, as opposed to the political, effects of strikes;37 and the advantages for countries that adopt stricter targeting protocols to protect civilians.38 What this suggests, then, is that while countries may have \"an obligation to utilise unmanned systems, their deployment should be subject to strict oversight.\"39 This is because, as Timothy Challans contends, \"[w]ith restraint comes legitimacy.\"40\n\nHypotheses about these moral norms are a useful starting point for understanding variation in the publics perceptions about morally legitimate drone strikes. These person-centered and act-based interpretations of moral legitimacy, however, are often treated as being isolated from one another. Yet, it may be the case that the public combines moral norms when adjudicating the legitimacy of strikes, even if they are \"morally dumbfounded\" and cannot explain how they formed a judgment.41 Different moral norms may also be triggered by the specific attributes of different strikes, including the use and constraint of drones. Looking at intuitions and rules may allow us to better account for how the public combines moral norms when assessing the legitimacy of strikes.\n\nIntuitions, Rules, and the Moral Legitimacy of Drone Warfare\n\nOne way to understand how the public may combine moral norms is to explore peoples intuitions. Intuitions are rapid evaluative judgments about the morality of behavior that derive from the intersection of raw emotion and cognition.42 Intuitions are predicated on a dual-process theory of psychology that distinguishes between two mechanisms. The first mechanism consists of a bundle of compartmentalized and task-specific systems, such as a persons norm system, that are thought to automatically generate intuitions. The second mechanism is synonymous with consciousness or purposeful reflection. This implies that assuming that the publics judgment is based primarily on deliberative reasoning may be dubious, even if it is widely assumed.43 Thus, we can move beyond the assumption that one or the other moral norm definitively shapes the publics perceptions about the legitimacy of drone strikes toward a more dynamic theory of how moral norms may work in combination. Crucially, intuitions, like reasoning, are also testable.\n\nOn the basis of this realization, I hypothesize that countries use of drones whether tactically or strategically and the degree to which they are constrained whether unilaterally or multilaterally to protect against civilian casualties, can shape the publics intuitions about what constitutes morally legitimate strikes. My hypothesis builds off two areas of related research. The first investigates the publics attribution for moral responsibility given mistakes that may result from a countrys use of military robots, including drones.44 The second explores the implications of such moral attitudes in shaping public opinion about emerging technologies in war, such as drones.45 I advance this literature by bridging it with an appreciation for the publics perceptions of legitimacy, which has yet to be systematically done in the drone warfare scholarship. Although scholars may identify legitimacy as the locus of success in drone warfare, most are reticent to treat legitimacy as a dependent variable given reasonable methodological concerns.46 Legitimacy is a social condition, meaning that it is difficult to measure. As I show below, however, it is possible to treat legitimacy as a dependent variable while using statistical methods to analyze empirically derived data of the publics perceptions.47\n\nWhereas scholars often argue that the consequences of strikes, whether in terms of the protection of civilians or soldiers, condition the moral status of drones,48 I claim that the publics perception of morally legitimate strikes is framed by informal rules that relate to countries varying use and constraint of drones. Shifts in these rules, or why and how countries use drones, may prime people to select courage, outcomes for soldiers, and/or duties to civilians from within their norm system when forming a moral judgment about strikes. What this also means is that the public may draw from several moral norms at once, rather than simply recalling one over the others, when adjudicating the legitimacy of drone strikes. This theory is useful, then, because it specifies the mechanisms that may moderate the publics perceptions of morally legitimate drone warfare.\n\nInformal Rules About Use and Constraint\n\nRules categorize what is permissible behavior, according to a given set of moral norms. Rules give meaning to norms, in other words, by prescribing or proscribing behavior.49 In the context of drone warfare, rules emerge from the publics understanding of the martial virtues and the just war tradition. The martial virtues, such as honor and sacrifice, help to inform the publics understanding of soldiers appropriate behavior in war.50 The just war tradition is codified in international humanitarian law, also known as the Law of Armed Conflict, that governs how countries ought to use force in war. Together, the martial virtues and international humanitarian law suggest that reciprocal or shared risk between combatants on the battlefield, as well as giving effective notice to allow for self-defense, are necessary for wartime behavior to be considered morally justified.51\n\nWhile some understand moral rules to be rigid and broadly known or official, the reality is more complicated. Rules are often mediated by situational context and can be informal, which sometimes leads to \"moral flexibility.\"52 The international relations theory literature on regimes also argues that countries can follow informal rules to a greater or lesser degree \"as their power and interests change.\"53 Importantly, doing so does not nullify the norms from which rules emerge but may nevertheless impact the publics perceptions of legitimate behavior.\n\nI argue that countries often align their strikes in terms of two informal rules: use and constraint. The use rule relates to why countries choose to use drones in the first place and is designed to ensure that countries uphold key expectations of wartime conduct when executing strikes, namely reciprocal risk and the right to self-defense. Drone strikes can either be used for tactical or strategic purposes.\n\nCountries may use drones tactically during discrete or hasty engagements with combatants to achieve near-term, limited military objectives, including the defense of ground forces, in declared theaters of operations such as Afghanistan.54 As such, Daniel Brunstetter describes the tactical use of drones as defensively oriented.55 Countries tactical use of drones is reflected in at least two ways. Commanders use strikes during engagements in support of ground forces. According to Wayne Phelps, this characterizes a majority of strikes. In these scenarios, drones loiter above conflict zones waiting to identify \"someone to be killed or something to be destroyed.\"56 Medea Benjamin adds that drones mostly \"patrol the skies looking for suspicious activity and, if they find it, they attack.\"57 Drones are also often deployed in support of expeditionary missions in declared theaters of operations. Tactical strikes, then, do not contravene international norms, including norms about not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.\n\nCountries can also use drones strategically, which Joseph Chapa describes as using them as a \"foreign policy tool.\"58 Contrary to the tactical use of drones, the strategic use of drones is more comprehensive and deliberately planned because it is central to the way in which political officials intend to defeat an adversary, especially in undeclared theaters of operations such as Pakistan. Political officials assume that killing key terrorist leaders is an effective way to hasten an enemys demise while protecting soldiers on the battlefield.59 Preserving soldiers lives also helps to minimize the reputational costs that officials may incur for using force abroad.60 A related reason why elected officials may choose to use drones strategically is to restore a countrys sovereignty or territorial integrity. In some cases, drones provide officials with the least bad option for augmenting the security of fragile or failing countries.61 For some specialists, then, the strategic use of drones promises a cooperative approach to achieve common goals, but only if strikes are requested by officials within the targeted countries.62\n\nIt is also possible to empirically identify when a country is using drones strategically. In contrast to the tactical use of strikes, strategic strikes are characterized by the centralization of the authority to conduct strikes in executive officials, such as presidents or senior defense officials; the lack of reciprocal risk between combatants on either side of a conflict; a network of globally distributed bases from which to launch, recover, and maintain drones; and the potential erosion of a targeted countrys sovereignty, should an intervening country abuse the scope of its intervention.63 According to Brunstetter and Amlie Frey, this latter feature relates to an \"imperial slide,\" which \"occurs when protecting or restoring sovereignty slips into imperial drone use, thus marking the decision to override traditional sovereignty norms of other states.\"64 An imperial slide seems to have taken place in Pakistan during the Obama administration. Though Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf may have welcomed U.S. strikes against al-Qaeda in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in 2004, he later withdrew consent. However, President Barack Obama expanded the U.S. drone program there, leading to public outrage.65 In sum, countries can use drones either for tactical or strategic purposes, something that may help to shape the publics views of strikes.\n\nThe public blowback encouraged Obama to adopt a policy that conditioned strike approval on the \"near\" certainty that no civilian casualties would occur as a result of U.S. drone strikes.\n\nIn addition to the use rule, I propose that there is also an informal rule about countries constraint of drones, which relates to their obligation to prevent civilian casualties. Countries can use drones with unilateral or multilateral constraint. Unilateral constraint is implemented by officials within one country only. This type of constraint does not require the approval of other countries. Rather, it is best characterized by \"delegatory\" accountability in which the enforcement of targeting constraints is the remit of political officials, military leaders, and commanders from a single country that is operating within a conflict zone. Although sanctioning a targeting country for causing civilian casualties usually occurs after the fact, the risk of reputational harm can help to shape a countrys drone policy to prevent such outcomes before a strike is launched.66 In light of this observation, Doyle Hodges describes unilateral constraint as \"military legalism.\" \"When the legitimacy of a U.S. conflict is contested,\" he explains, \"policy-makers are likely to implement rule-based regimes of constraint on the use of force in an effort to re-capture legitimacy.\"67\n\nOne example is Obamas Presidential Policy Guidance that was adopted in May 2013.68 The policy emerged amid heightened global criticism about the considerable harm that U.S. drone strikes were inflicting on civilians in Pakistan. Obama was initially comfortable striking targets based on the appearance of terrorist activity in an area. These \"signature strikes\" were criticized for harming civilians because they did not rely on positive identification of a terrorist being present.69 The public blowback encouraged Obama to adopt a policy that conditioned strike approval on the \"near\" certainty that no civilian casualties would occur as a result of U.S. drone strikes. Obamas stringent targeting protocol dramatically reduced civilian casualties from 2013 until the end of his presidency. Civilian deaths went from approximately 13 per month to just one or fewer, the precision of strikes increased to 95 percent, and nearly 300 civilian deaths were averted.70 Neha Ansaris field research, in which she interviewed 116 residents who had been exposed to the U.S. drone program in Pakistan, shows that Obamas policy change improved the publics perceptions that the strikes were morally legitimate, with one respondent claiming that \"[t]he drone is a justice-delivering technology.\"71\n\nMultilateral constraint, on the other hand, obligates countries to meet the oversight requirements of allies and partners. The purpose of requiring international approval for drone strikes, especially through the United Nations, is to enforce laws and norms that help to legitimize operations.72 Strikes conducted under multilateral constraints typically demonstrate a shared responsibility among countries to protect against civilian casualties.73 Multilateral constraints relate to a \"participatory\" model of accountability, wherein \"the performance of power-wielders is evaluated by those who are affected by their actions.\"74 In the context of drone warfare, multilateral constraints consist of stricter targeting protocols, which are enforced during an inclusive coordination process involving political officials, military representatives, and operational commanders from numerous countries. This results in a negotiated process, usually through a regional or international coalition of cooperating countries, to approve the use of strikes based on their anticipated military advantages. Chief among these benefits is being able to kill terrorists while simultaneously protecting friendly forces and preventing civilian casualties.\n\nIn addition to shifts in the tactical and strategic use of drones, then, countries can also vary the type of constraint under which strikes occur. Constraint, which can consist of unilaterally or multilaterally imposing targeting protocols on countries employment of drones, may also help to shape the publics views of strikes, especially when coupled with different ways of using drones. Integrating these two informal rules enables us to investigate how different combinations of drone use and constraint affect the publics perceptions of moral legitimacy, which suggests deeper constellations of moral norms that are triggered by shifts in why and how countries use strikes.\n\nTheoretical Expectations\n\nTwo primary theoretical expectations emerge from this discussion of informal rules that may govern countries use and constraint of drones. First, I anticipate that variations in the use of drones and types of constraint will cause the public to combine moral norms in unique ways when determining the legitimacy of strikes. Forecasting the exact combination of moral norms that will emerge is beyond the scope of my analysis. The central contribution of this study is to show that the public may draw on multiple moral norms when adjudicating the legitimacy of strikes, which complements existing research and establishes an important baseline for future studies.\n\nSecond, I expect that changes in drone use and constraint will cause the public to perceive the legitimacy of strikes differently. I posit that the public will likely perceive strikes as most morally legitimate when they are used tactically and under multilateral constraint. I also anticipate that tactical strikes with unilateral constraint will confuse the public, even though this pattern of drone warfare now characterizes most drone strikes globally.75 This is because such strikes do not generate as much media attention as U.S. counterterrorism strikes, meaning they literally \"fly under the radar\" of global public opinion.76 Observers, then, have little prior knowledge to assess the moral probity of these strikes.\n\nIn addition, I anticipate that demographic and dispositional variables especially sex, education, political ideology, belief in the managerial role of great powers for global security, and support for the use of force abroad may also condition the publics perceptions of morally legitimate drone strikes.\n\nExperimental Design\n\nTo assess the effects of different types of drone use and constraint on the publics perceptions of what constitutes a morally legitimate strike, I carried out a survey experiment (see Appendix B for the complete survey). Respondents were recruited online from March 15 to 22, 2021, using Amazon Mechanical Turk. The 555 Americans that met the selection criteria, namely their proven ability to successfully complete other surveys in the past, were randomly assigned to one of five groups: four experimental groups and one control group (see Appendix A for the summary statistics).\n\nWhile some scholars question the merits of online-based respondent pools, a body of literature finds that subjects drawn from the internet can provide a representative sample of the public.77 To further ensure as representative of a sample as possible, I used the recent U.S. census to check that the aggregate survey pool met certain demographic percentages. Ultimately, the respondent pool was broadly representative of the American public, except when it came to age, education, and race. Relative to the U.S. population, my respondent pool was slightly younger, more educated, and predominately white. These considerations caution against drawing sweeping conclusions based on the results of the survey. Nevertheless, my findings still reveal key differences in how Americans perceive strikes depending on why they are used and how they are constrained. At the same time, because \"young adults tend to have less-crystallized social and political attitudes than do older people,\" this population is useful in empirical tests of new theories.78\n\nEach group of respondents was presented with a randomized drone strike scenario and then prompted to assess the moral legitimacy of the operation. The scenarios differed in terms of drone use and constraint. Specifically, the four experimental groups received the following drone strike conditions: strategic use and multilateral constraint (group one); tactical use and multilateral constraint (group two); strategic use and unilateral constraint (group three); and tactical use and unilateral constraint (group four).\n\nThe first experimental manipulation involved a fictional countrys Country A use of a drone to kill a terrorist in another country Country B. Groups two and four were told that Country A uses drones as \"a tactic against terrorists on the battlefield,\" and that \"Country A has a small number of drones, does not deploy them to bases across the globe, and prefers raids to drone strikes.\" Groups one and three were told that Country A uses drones \"as a key pillar of its national security policy and military strategy,\" and that \"Country A has the most drones in the world, deploys them to bases across the globe, and prefers drone strikes to raids.\"\n\nThe second experimental manipulation involved Country As constraint of a drone strike. Groups one and two were told that \"Country A allows its allies to approve its drone strikes through coalition military operations.\" Groups three and four were told that \"Country A prefers to use drone strikes without consulting with or seeking the approval of other countries.\" Respondents in the control group, the fifth group, did not receive information on drone use and constraint.\n\nAll respondents, including those in the control group, also learned that the \"strike results in one civilian casualty but removes the terrorist who had been planning to attack Country A.\" According to data collected by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism on U.S. drone strikes from 2002 to 2018, the reported range of civilian casualties per strike is between .53 and 1.15.79 This suggests that the average U.S. drone strike typically results in approximately one civilian casualty or less. Of course, this is a tragic outcome given the promised benefits of drones, which is to protect against unnecessary civilian harms. Yet, this finding helps to justify my decision to include only one civilian casualty in the vignettes rather than multiple civilian deaths, which scholars often include in other surveys about U.S. drone strikes without explaining why.80\n\nAfter reading their vignette, respondents assessed the legitimacy of the drone strike by answering the following question: \"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing not morally legitimate and 10 representing very morally legitimate, how legitimate is Country As use of the drone strike?\" To examine the implications of use and constraint on perceptions of moral responsibility, respondents were also asked to assess culpability for the civilian casualty: \"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing not morally responsible and 10 representing very morally responsible, how morally responsible is Country A for the civilian casualties that resulted from the drone strike?\" Respondents also answered the following open-ended question: \"What factors did you consider while evaluating the moral legitimacy of Country As use of a drone strike in Country B?\" Previous research indicates that asking such a question \"can also yield useful information, especially when researchers need to explore complex issues that do not have a finite or predetermined set of responses.\"81\n\nTo manage these challenges, I constructed scenarios using hypothetical but realistic examples of drone strikes.\n\nIn addition to these main questions of interest, the survey asked respondents to answer several dispositional questions. Respondents were asked to gauge their political ideology using a 7-point scale ranging from \"extremely liberal\" (1) to \"extremely conservative\" (7). They were also asked to assess their support for the use of force abroad as well as their belief that great powers should provide for global security. For both questions, respondents answered on a 5-point scale, ranging from \"strongly disagree\" (1) to \"strongly agree\" (5).\n\nI then analyzed the data using several statistical methods. First, I used an analysis of variance technique to compare respondents average or mean responses for the moral legitimacy of the drone strike, as well as the moral culpability of the country for the civilian casualty.82 Second, when comparing differences in the legitimacy and responsibility outcomes between the control and experimental groups, I used a t-test, which shows the statistical significance of the difference between two means for a given response.83 Third, I used multivariate regression analysis to determine the implications of several demographic and dispositional variables on perceptions of legitimacy when holding all other factors constant.\n\nTo analyze data from the open-ended question, I coded the responses according to their emphasis on soldiers courage (1), the protection of soldiers (2), the protection of civilians (3), or some conflated logic (4). Conscious of the potential to inadvertently misrepresent respondents intentions, I reviewed the responses twice, coding them separately each time, and adjudicated any differences.84 The rejection rate was less than 1 percent and I recoded this small number of responses as conflated logic because it was difficult to determine the emphasis on any one moral norm. Following this process, I determined the percentage of respondents emphasizing different moral norms within each experimental group. Finally, I measured the time it took respondents to complete the survey, which is useful to help determine if those assigned to group four find it difficult to interpret the moral legitimacy of a drone strike used tactically with unilateral constraint. This experimental design is advantageous for several reasons. First, it resembles how people make moral judgments, which is to say for one event at a time in this case for one drone strike, rather than for multiple drone strikes in a given setting.85 Second, randomized controlled trials, such as survey experiments, help to resolve bias that can distort studies that use comparative case analysis.86 Third, randomly and evenly distributing respondents across experimental groups resolves the need to take extra steps to account for bias when drawing inferences about the implications of different types of strikes on perceptions of legitimacy, such as incorporating control variables to capture potentially omitted factors.87\n\nWhile surveys are useful for isolating the effect of an experimental manipulation on some outcome, they are sometimes criticized for resulting in biased findings. Surveys can suffer from priming when respondents are encouraged to answer in a certain way or social desirability bias when respondents feel obligated to give answers that seem more socially acceptable. To manage these challenges, I constructed scenarios using hypothetical but realistic examples of drone strikes.88 Research shows that using fictional country names can minimize respondents tendency to reason by analogy, which risks distorting their intuitions. Preconceived notions are a challenge in drone warfare studies because they represent what methodologists refer to as a pretreatment condition, which is difficult to account for in a survey design. Therefore, they can bias the results. For instance, it is possible that respondents believe that U.S. political and military officials prefer to use strategic strikes with unilateral constraint to kill terrorists abroad, a pattern that has elicited the most public scrutiny. These strikes have been criticized for lacking transparency,89 contravening international law,90 and resulting in more civilian casualties than is acknowledged.91 My approach of using fictional but realistic scenarios, then, helps to enhance the validity of the findings. It also allows me to meet the concerns of scholars who criticize surveys for dubious treatment effects or how well they approximate respondents beliefs in the real world.92\n\nExperimental Results\n\nUse and Constraint\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the respondents generally viewed strikes as relatively legitimate, with the average response across all experimental groups being a 6.2 out of 10. When aggregating across all experimental groups as well, an analysis of variance shows that shifts in countries use and constraint of drones can shape the publics perceptions of what constitutes morally legitimate strikes, which is a highly statistically significant result.93 Countries that submit to multilateral constraint favorably affect the publics perceptions of legitimacy. This effect is strongest when a country uses drones tactically. This pattern of drone warfare encouraged respondents to rate the moral legitimacy of strikes at nearly one point higher than if a country conducted a strike under unilateral constraint.\n\nBy contrast, respondents penalized the moral legitimacy of countries that adopted multilateral constraint but used drones strategically by nearly three quarters of a point. This outcome is similar to the publics perceptions of moral legitimacy for unilaterally constrained strikes, regardless of how they are used. Although at a lower level of statistical significance, an analysis of variance also shows that the type of constraint can shape the publics perceptions of moral culpability for a civilian casualty. Unilateral constraint resulted in nearly a half-point increase in perceived responsibility for the civilian casualty, with more culpability attributed to countries that launched a strategic strike.\n\nFigure 1: Legitimacy and Responsibility Outcomes Across All Experimental Groups\n\nUsing t-tests to compare the legitimacy and responsibility outcomes between the control group and four experimental groups also results in several notable findings (see Appendix C for graphs of the statistical results). The public perceives a country that launches a tactical strike with multilateral constraint (group two) as most morally legitimate (a highly statistically significant outcome). At the same time, a country whose use of drones aligns with group two has a higher probability of escaping moral culpability for a civilian casualty. Statistically speaking, this means that there was no difference between the control group and experimental group two in terms of the moral responsibility for collateral damage. There is, however, a moderately statistically significant difference in moral culpability for a civilian casualty when comparing the control group with experimental group three strategic use and unilateral constraint. Respondents in experimental group three thought that strategically oriented strikes with internally imposed constraint incur more moral responsibility for a civilian casualty than respondents assigned to the control or baseline group.\n\nStatistically speaking, there was also no difference between the control group and experimental group four tactical use and unilateral constraint in terms of the publics perceptions of moral legitimacy. Respondents in experimental group four seemed to demonstrate \"cognitive wrestling\" in making their assessments, meaning that they appeared confused about what constitutes a morally legitimate strike.94 \"If there is no reason to choose one baseline over the other,\" Walter Sinnott-Armstrong explains, \"then our moral intuitions seem arbitrary and unjustified.\"95 Of course, we must be careful to not overinterpret this result. This does not necessarily imply that the public does not perceive this pattern of tactical strikes with unilateral constraint as morally illegitimate. It only shows that we cannot be sufficiently certain whether or not it does compared to alternative models of strikes. Even so, this finding suggests that the use rule is at least as salient as the constraint rule.\n\nMore indicative of group fours confusion, perhaps, is the time it took respondents to complete the survey compared to subjects in other experimental groups. It took respondents assigned to group four about two minutes longer to finish the survey. This is a notable finding because it suggests that respondents may have transitioned to deliberate moral reasoning given a clash of intuitions, which my analysis of subjects responses to the open-ended question seems to corroborate, as I discuss below. Emblematic of the reasoning of other respondents assigned to group four, one participant made the following observation when commenting on the legitimacy of the strike:\n\nThe fact that they were attacking a known terrorist, however, this is an assassination and not what I would consider proper justice, as they may have had the wrong person. But, lives may be lost by attempting to bring the terrorist to court, so its really a double-edged sword.\n\nDemographic and Dispositional Results\n\nMultivariate regression analysis sheds additional light on other factors that can shape the publics perceptions of morally legitimate strikes (see Appendix C for the regression table). First, the results are consistent with previous findings that women can become more hawkish than men when forced to decide between killing U.S. soldiers or other combatants.96 Women in this study were more apt to perceive a countrys strike as morally legitimate than men, and by nearly half a point (a low level of statistical significance).\n\nSecond, higher levels of education are also related to perceptions that a strike is morally legitimate. Yet, the additive value is marginal. More education only accounts for one-tenth of a point improvement in legitimacy (a moderately statistically significant result).\n\nThird, when aggregating respondents across all experimental groups, the multivariate regression analysis does not suggest that political ideology is a good predicator of whether the public will perceive a strike as morally legitimate. When comparing the implications of political ideology for the legitimacy outcomes across the control group and all experimental groups, however, the results suggest a more complicated picture. The more conservative a respondent, the more likely he or she was to perceive a countrys use of drones as morally legitimate, which is consistent with previous research.97 This finding is marginally statistically significant for group one (strategic, multilateral), moderately statistically significant for group two (tactical, multilateral), and highly statistically significant for group three (strategic, unilateral). Political ideology is not statistically significant in terms of group four (tactical, unilateral), meaning that how conservative or liberal a respondent was did not affect the legitimacy outcome. This is an unsurprising result given how confounding the scenario seems to have been for respondents. Indeed, group four is responsible for the statistically insignificant results for political ideology when aggregating respondents across all experimental groups, which the regression analysis reflects.\n\nFourth, support for the use of force abroad had a stronger effect on perceptions of legitimacy than belief in the role of great powers in ensuring global security. Respondents who demonstrated higher support for the use of force abroad (those who selected \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\") perceived a strike to be more morally legitimate than those who did not, and by well over a point. This is the greatest impact of any single factor on perceived legitimacy, which amounts to approximately an 18 percent gain in legitimacy relative to the average perceived legitimacy outcome for respondents across all experimental groups (a highly statistically significant result). As illustrated in Figure 2, support for the use of force had the greatest impact on perceived legitimacy when it came to group two (tactical strike with multilateral constraint).\n\nFigure 2: Support for the Use of Force Abroad and Public Perceptions of Moral Legitimacy\n\nOpen-Ended Question\n\nFinally, my analysis of the open-ended question indicates that the public recalls more than one moral norm when determining the moral legitimacy of a strike (Figure 3). On balance, respondents drew on different combinations of moral norms depending on how a country uses a drone strike (tactically or strategically) and how the strike is constrained (unilaterally or multilaterally). Interestingly, an overwhelming number of participants did not emphasize physical courage when determining the moral legitimacy of strikes. This person-centered norm was only recalled by an average of eight respondents within each experimental group. This finding suggests that while scholars may characterize drones as \"post-heroic,\"98 \"riskless,\"99 \"radically asymmetric,\"100 \"merely a technical vocation,\"101 \"morally deskilled,\"102 or simply a \"desk job,\"103 most Americans do not consider the disconnected status of drone operators from the battlefield as much as other factors when forming a moral judgment. Instead, respondents emphasized either the outcomes of strikes in terms of soldiers safety or a countrys obligation to protect civilians. This finding is consistent with research on Americans reticence to risk soldiers lives in combat.104 Even so, this emphasis on outcomes or obligations can change depending on how strikes are used and constrained, which I discuss below.\n\nFigure 3: Respondents Recall of Moral Norms by Experimental Groups\n\nGroup 1\n\nGroup 2\n\nGroup 3\n\nGroup 4\n\nDiscussion, Policy Implications, and Future Research\n\nBelow, I discuss my findings before addressing their potential implications for U.S. drone policy. To further understand the relationship between public opinion and drone warfare, I conclude my article by making several recommendations for future research.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn line with my initial expectation, responses to the open-ended question suggest that, on balance, respondents did not typically relate the moral legitimacy of a strike to merely one norm, as war ethicists typically argue. Rather, respondents recalled unique combinations of moral norms from their norm system based on how a country uses a strike tactically or strategically and how that strike is constrained unilaterally or multilaterally. Group one (strategic, multilateral) recalled the moral norm of keeping soldiers safe more often than battlefield courage or duties of care to civilians when assessing the legitimacy of a strike. This may suggest that the public believes that the external oversight exercised by regional or international security institutions on a countrys use of drones better accounts for civilian protection, giving respondents the space to emphasize the safety of soldiers more. Indeed, respondents emphasis on the protection of soldiers and civilians flipped when a country uses a drone strategically with unilateral constraint (group three). What this seems to indicate is that the American public is aware that this model of drone warfare imposes greater risks to civilians, causing people to more closely link the moral legitimacy of a strike with the protection of civilians.\n\nThis trend is consistent with respondents understanding of a tactical strike with multilateral constraint (group two), but for a different reason, it seems. Tactical strikes, though they may impose greater harms on soldiers because of heightened reciprocal risk between combatants and a more effective notice of self-defense on the battlefield, are also prone to errors given the lack of information and uncertainty, which is sometimes called the \"fog of war.\"105 This apparently encouraged respondents to prioritize the moral norm of civilian protection most.\n\nThis trend breaks down, however, when a country uses tactical strikes with unilateral constraint (group four). Consistent with my other findings, and notwithstanding that this pattern of drone warfare increasingly characterizes how most countries use strikes, which is to say within their own borders and with little to no external oversight, respondents did not seem to know how to make sense of the legitimacy of these operations. Such confusion was reflected in respondents recall of moral norms in such a way that it is impossible to decipher which one or ones take priority. Indeed, subjects in group four conflated moral norms the most.\n\nIn sum, the results indicate that the use and constraint rules, in combination rather than separately, encouraged respondents to draw on moral norms in unique ways when reflecting on the legitimacy of strikes. These results also echo a recent finding that Americans observing conflict \"integrate instrumental and normative concerns about right and wrong\" when assessing the moral status of wartime behaviors.106\n\nThe findings of this study also corroborate my hypothesis that shifts in why and how a country uses drones can shape the publics perceptions of morally legitimate drone warfare. As I anticipated, a countrys tactical use of strikes under multilateral constraint (group two) garners the most moral legitimacy among Americans. This finding is important for at least two reasons. First, this pattern of drone warfare corresponds to French strikes in Mali, which some experts characterize as a distinct \"French model.\"107 France uses strikes selectively against terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, and in consultation with a peacekeeping mission authorized by U.N. Resolution 2100 adopted in 2013.108 For example, France used a drone strike in August 2021 to kill the leader of the Islamic State in Africa, Adnan Abu Walid al Sahrawi. He was responsible for the deaths of French and Nigerian aid workers as well as four U.S. soldiers in 2017.109 Second, in conducting my analysis, I found that there was virtually no difference between the control group and group two in terms of the publics perceptions of moral responsibility for a civilian casualty, which is helpful for explaining the difference in attitudes toward and coverage of American and French drone strikes in Africa. Compared to Americas adoption of so-called \"over-the-horizon\" strikes,110 characterized by the strategic use of drones with unilateral constraint (group three), respondents understand Frances tactical use of drones with multilateral constraint to be more morally legitimate.\n\nIt is surprising that a country launching a tactical drone strike, rather than a strategic one, should encourage respondents to discount collateral damage resulting from that strike, particularly civilian casualties. What can possibly explain this intuition to discount moral culpability for a civilian casualty in this case? It could be that respondents interpreted this pattern of drone warfare as resulting in \"genuine accident collateral damage.\"111 It is also possible that this pattern of drone warfare encourages the public to discount moral culpability for unintended consequences because strikes seem more reasonable, being conducted in a declared theater of operations with external oversight. David Traven refers to this as the \"intention/side-effect\" distinction that holds \"intended killings are morally worse than unintended, side-effect killings.\"112 Thus, my findings in this case are helpful to corroborate research suggesting that greater external oversight of military robots can shape perceptions of moral responsibilities for mistakes.113\n\nMy analysis indicates that support for the use of force abroad had the strongest impact on participants' understanding of what constitutes a morally legitimate drone strike.\n\nAt the same time, the results confirm my suspicion that Americans cannot easily reconcile the moral legitimacy of a countrys tactical use of drones with unilateral constraint (group four). Indeed, both my statistical analysis and review of respondents feedback on the open-ended question show that Americans struggle to determine the moral legitimacy of this pattern of strikes, which is how most countries are using drones. In the absence of prior knowledge about this emerging pattern of drone warfare, it is possible that respondents assigned to group four simply conflated these strikes with U.S. political and military officials preference to use drones strategically with unilateral constraint. The potential for Americans heuristic reasoning in this case, however, deserves more careful study. Compared to the control group, respondents assigned to group three did not penalize the legitimacy of a countrys strategic use of strikes with unilateral constraint as we may have expected. This pattern of drone warfare corresponds to former U.S. President Donald Trumps use of a strike to kill Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Suleimani in January 2020. A comparison to the control group also reflects that the relationship between a countrys use of strikes strategically with multilateral constraint (group one) and the publics perceptions of moral legitimacy is not statistically significant. What these findings seem to suggest, then, is that a more reasonable explanation for the confusion of respondents assigned to group four is a genuine clash of intuitions that they cannot readily resolve, especially because the strike does not seem to affect them directly.114\n\nFinally, the results reinforce my expectation that several demographic and dispositional factors may also condition the publics perceptions of moral legitimacy, albeit to different degrees. This is an equally important finding because while scholars often assume that social and political factors shape the moral status of drone warfare as intuited by the public, they do not often validate their claims.115 To the extent that scholars do conduct empirical research on the moral legitimacy of war, they focus on ground-based conflict as opposed to drone warfare, and concede that their experimental designs \"hide heterogeneity among subjects.\"116\n\nMy study used empirically derived data to show that sex, education, belief in the managerial responsibilities of great powers for ensuring global security, and support for the use of force abroad can help to shape the publics perceptions of the moral legitimacy of drone strikes. My analysis indicates that support for the use of force abroad had the strongest impact on participants understanding of what constitutes a morally legitimate drone strike. As reflected in Figure 2, respondents perceived legitimacy for a drone strike varied in terms of their support for the use of force abroad. The results in Figure 2 also suggest that, for respondents who do not support the use of force abroad, the tactical use of strikes is considered most legitimate, regardless of the type of constraint. I return to this finding in the conclusion because it suggests the possibility of evolving patterns of drone warfare globally that scholars have yet to rigorously explore in terms of public opinion. Instead, scholars usually interpret drone warfare as a U.S. phenomenon, although strikes against terrorists in faraway places no longer characterizes how countries predominantly use drones.117\n\nTogether, these findings make several contributions to the scholarship on public opinion and drone warfare. First, whereas scholars often relate legitimate strikes to one moral norm, the results of my empirical study show that the public can combine these norms when adjudicating the legitimacy of a strike. These unique constellations of moral norms, which people rapidly recall from their norm system, are shaped by why and how a country uses drones. Second, besides providing new insights on the publics recall of moral norms, the use and constraint rules explored in this study help to explain puzzling variations in the publics perceptions of what constitutes a morally legitimate drone strike. Returning to the difference in how American and French strikes in Africa are viewed, the results suggest that the public may interpret the legitimacy of these strikes differently because of why and how drones are being used there, something that carries important policy and research implications, which I discuss below. Finally, inquiry into the moral legitimacy of strikes ties into the research agenda for the moral psychology of war. Overall, my study emphasizes the importance of taking an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the underlying mechanisms that shapes how the public forms moral judgments about drone warfare.118\n\nPolicy Implications\n\nThese results have a number of implications for U.S. drone policy. My results suggest that the most morally legitimate type of drone warfare in the minds of Americans may be the tactical use of strikes with multilateral constraint. Ironically, this model of drone warfare corresponds to French strikes in Mali. This type of strike represents a compromise between U.S. officials preference for strategic strikes with unilateral constraint take, for example, the Biden administrations operation that killed al-Qaeda Senior Leader Ayman al Zawahiri in Afghanistan and the total abandonment of armed and networked drones, which characterizes Germanys position.119\n\nThis finding does not mean that U.S. officials cannot or should not use strikes strategically to address security challenges abroad, especially terrorism. This is especially true given a body of recent literature that suggests that drones can be effective at reducing the incidence of terrorism both globally and in certain regions and countries.120 Rather, from a strictly moral position, this finding only suggests that it may be best for U.S. officials to refrain from using drones strategically if strikes do not have the approval and oversight of other countries.\n\nEven then, constraint is a complicated matter. Not only have U.S. officials exploited the ease of using drones to circumvent congressional oversight and public accountability for the use of force abroad, causing Milena Sterio to characterize presidents as the \"judge, jury, and executioner\" when it comes to drone strikes,121 but when aggregating the results across all experimental groups, I also find that U.S. citizens generally view strikes as morally legitimate. Indeed, my findings indicate that the public does not always reward multilateral constraint as we might anticipate, though the tendency is for the public to perceive these strikes as most morally legitimate. At the same time, my results suggest that the public does not always punish unilateral constraint as we might predict. Americans, it seems, have outstanding questions about how countries use and constrain drones, which is most clearly reflected by the confusion of respondents assigned to group four (tactical, unilateral).\n\nThus, if U.S. officials continue to use drones strategically with unilateral constraint, which appears to be a foregone conclusion given the trajectory of U.S. drone policy across four successive presidential administrations since 2001, they should clearly explain the security benefits, the legality of the strikes, and the oversight measures that are being adopted to protect against civilian casualties. My analysis suggests that this latter action, notwithstanding strong support from conservatives and those who endorse the use of force abroad for strategic strikes with unilateral constraint, could help to further enhance the perceived legitimacy of strikes, at least among U.S. citizens. This policy adjustment is important because these \"over-the-horizon\" strikes circumvent congressional oversight and public accountability, which can impose unintended security costs. Following the Suleimani strike, for example, Iran used ballistic missiles against U.S. military installations and personnel in the region.122 This suggests that the strategic use of drones with unilateral constraint risks escalating interstate tensions despite research that suggests that drones are inherently de-escalatory compared to other manned platforms, such as bombers and jets.123 This pattern of drone warfare, by necessity, also breaches the sovereignty of other countries and risks egregious, but preventable, errors taking place, as demonstrated by the Biden administrations botched strike in August 2021 that killed 10 Afghan civilians rather than a suspected Islamic State terrorist.124\n\nFortunately, it appears that U.S. officials now recognize that American drone strikes abroad are not widely perceived as being morally legitimate and that they should continue to make critical changes to the countrys drone policy and operations. In early October 2022, for instance, the Biden administration reintroduced the Obama administrations \"near\" certainty standard for no civilian casualties during strikes.125 Several months earlier, in late August 2022, the Department of Defense also released the \"Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan\" to help to minimize civilian casualties during strikes.126 The 36-page plan institutes a blistering set of changes. Among these, it defines the \"civilian environment\" as the context for military operations. It introduces \"Civilian Environment Teams\" to help commanders to understand the human terrain and establishes \"Red-Teaming\" to minimize cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, that can result in preventable targeting errors. The plan introduces a new architecture across the U.S. military, overseen from the Pentagon, to implement these sweeping doctrinal, planning, and training changes to mitigate civilian casualties during future wars. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also emphasized that the plan is applicable to large-scale combat operations between countries as well.127\n\nPolitical officials should continue to emphasize the need for these modifications as a way to change the culture within the U.S. military to further account for the protection of civilians in planning and operations. Indeed, defense leaders are beginning to understand that civilian protection can be both a measure of effectiveness as well as a measure of performance, which is a change that human rights advocates and groups have long endorsed.128 Instead of simply pointing to the lack of civilian casualties as a way to explain how well U.S. forces conduct operations, military leaders increasingly view preventing civilian casualties as a key wartime objective in its own right. Rather than merely asserting that U.S. drone strikes are \"righteous\" or legitimate because they kill terrorists,129 as was the case following the strike in Afghanistan in August 2021, political and military officials now make an effort to explain in great detail what unilateral constraints they adopted to prevent civilian casualties. Bidens statement to the American people following the death of al Zawahiri is one recent example of the U.S. militarys heightened sensitivity to civilian casualties as a result of policy guidance from elected officials. President Joe Biden explained that the \"mission was carefully planned and rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians. And one week ago, after being advised that the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him, and the mission was a success. None of his family members were hurt, and there were no civilian casualties.\"130\n\nFuture Research\n\nThe results of this study also indicate a number of paths for future research on the moral permissibility of strikes. As a first step, researchers should conduct surveys in countries that have also adopted drones to determine the generalizability of this studys findings. Among other scholars, Hodges cautions that \"the concept of legitimacy is highly contingent on context and the audience performing the assessment.\"131 My initial research suggests that, while the publics perceptions of legitimate strikes can be a function of why and how drones are used, the outcomes for legitimacy can also be shaped by which country is conducting strikes, whether the strikes have international approval, and the unintended consequences of such strikes, especially civilian casualties.132\n\n[W]hat are the implications of using cheaper, commercially available, and easily weaponized drones, such as the Chinese-manufactured DJI, on public attitudes toward drone warfare?\n\nResearchers should also consider conducting cross-national surveys to better understand how the use and constraint rules may shape perceptions of morally legitimate drone warfare among publics within targeted countries. This line of inquiry is critical given Jonathan Haidts argument that intuitions are both innate and enculturated, suggesting that the publics perceptions of morally legitimate strikes may be patterned differently across the globe.133 To the extent that other scholars assess the attitudes of publics within countries that are being targeted by drones, they conduct field research in dangerous settings that, while helpful, can be prone to bias. Their respondent pools consist of citizens affected by drones, making it difficult, if not impossible, to determine what actually accounts for citizens perceptions of legitimacy.134 Is it citizens prior beliefs about drones that shape their attitudes? Or is it exposure to harm during a strike that shapes their beliefs?\n\nIt may also be useful for researchers to investigate additional conditions that could shape the publics perceptions of moral legitimacy. Future studies could use different survey designs to vary the type and circumstances of civilian casualties. Researchers could also explicitly identify the targeting and targeted countries, as well as further specify the meaning of multilateral constraint. This includes defining the composition, disposition, and scope of coalitions, as well as authorization from the United Nations for conducting drone strikes. Research shows that approval from the United Nations for the use of force helps to shape the publics attitudes toward wartime behavior, which is likely to extend to drone strikes as well.135 Similar to recent research by Kersten Fisk, Jennifer L. Merolla, and Jennifer M. Ramos,136 as well as Michael Horowitz and Erik Lin-Greenberg,137 scholars could also explore the microfoundations of respondents understanding of legitimate drone warfare, which may reflect that additional core beliefs and values underline subjective beliefs of appropriate strikes. Finally, what are the implications of using cheaper, commercially available, and easily weaponized drones, such as the Chinese-manufactured DJI, on public attitudes toward drone warfare? Audrey Kurth Cronin notes, for instance, that these dual-use capabilities impose security challenges that are not as well understood by scholars.138 Indeed, this model of drone warfare has emerged in Ukraine, but we have little understanding of what the implications are for the publics perceptions of morally legitimate strikes.139\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, though scholars have studied, and continue to study, public opinion about drones, many questions remain. The purpose of this article was to explore one outstanding question relating to how the public understands the moral legitimacy of drone strikes. Scholars often define morally legitimate drone warfare either in terms of soldiers physical courage, the protection of soldiers, or the protection of civilians. While useful, the existing literature is based more on anecdote and scholars intuitions than analysis of empirically derived data about the publics perceptions of moral legitimacy. This reflects a general hesitancy among researchers to treat legitimacy as a dependent variable, though my study shows this is possible to do. At the same time, the existing literature has not explored how and why person-centered and act-based moral norms may work in concert to shape the publics perceptions of morally legitimate drone strikes.\n\nAnticipating that this may be the case, I introduced a novel middle-range theory based on informal rules to help to explain how and why individuals norm systems may be triggered when they learn of a drone strike, thus shaping their judgments about the moral legitimacy of a given operation. I used an original survey experiment among a broadly representative sample of Americans to show that why a country uses a drone tactically or strategically and how it constrains a strike unilaterally or multilaterally can shape respondents understanding of legitimacy, and that these judgments reflect unique combinations of moral norms. In doing so, I respond to previous research that urges scholars to \"unpack\" the mechanisms of perceived legitimacy in the context of military interventions abroad, of which drones are now a favored tool.140 Going forward, this framework may provide scholars, policymakers, and practitioners with a useful way to explain the broader evolution of drone warfare globally and to interpret the legitimacy outcomes, which most experts agree is integral to the sustainability of strikes abroad.\n\nPaul Lushenko is a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, General Andrew Jackson Goodpaster Scholar at Cornell University, and the deputy director of the Cornell Brooks School Tech Policy Institute.

The United States faces many economic, social, and political problems. To ensure you are paying attention, please select \"Independent\" from one of the following five options:\n\nCongress\n\nDemocratic\n\nRepublican\n\nWashington\n\nIndependent\n\nProgramming Note: General prompt provided to all respondents.\n\nThe following HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO describes one countrys use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, often referred to as a drone, to conduct a missile strike against a terrorist. The scenario that you will read describes a situation that has occurred before and will likely occur again. Countries use drone strikes for different reasons, under different conditions, and with different outcomes. I am most interested in how you understand the moral legitimacy of countries use of drone strikes, which relates to right or wrong behavior. I will describe a set of circumstances and ask how you understand the moral legitimacy and moral responsibility of the countrys use of the drone strike.\n\nPlease pay close attention to how Country A understands and uses drone warfare.\n\nProgramming Note: Treatment scenarios are randomized.\n\nScenario #1 Treatment (Strategy, Multilateral): Country A embraces drone warfare as not merely a tactic against terrorists on the battlefield, but as a key pillar of its national security policy and military strategy. Country A has the most drones in the world, deploys them to bases across the globe, and prefers drone strikes to raids to remove terrorists. At the same time, Country A allows its allies to approve its drone strikes through coalition military operations. Country A participates in meetings that afford its allies the ability to verify intelligence on a target, confirm a targets location, and enforce measures to mitigate civilian casualties, such as ensuring a strike is conducted against a target that is alone. Given this information on Country As high use of drone warfare, and its willingness to allow allies to approve its drone strikes, consider the following scenario. Country A, participating as a member of a coalition of allied countries, conducts a drone strike in Country B against a terrorist. The strike results in one civilian casualty but removes the terrorist who had been planning to attack Country A.\n\nScenario #2 Treatment (Tactic, Multilateral): Although Country A can afford to adopt drone warfare as a key pillar of its national security policy and military strategy, it does not embrace drone strikes as anything more than a tactic against terrorists on the battlefield. Country A has a small number of drones, does not deploy them to bases across the globe, and prefers raids to drone strikes to remove terrorists. At the same time, Country A allows its allies to approve its drone strikes through coalition military operations. Country A participates in meetings that afford its allies the ability to verify intelligence on a target, confirm a targets location, and enforce measures to mitigate civilian casualties, such as ensuring a strike is conducted against a target that is alone. Given this information on Country As little use of drone warfare, and its willingness to allow allies to approve its drone strikes, consider the following scenario. Country A, participating as a member of a coalition of allied countries, conducts a drone strike in Country B against a terrorist. The strike results in one civilian casualty but removes the terrorist who had been planning to attack Country A.\n\nScenario #3 Treatment (Strategic, Unilateral): Country A embraces drone warfare as not merely a tactic against terrorists on the battlefield, but as a key pillar of its national security policy and military strategy. Country A has the most drones in the world, deploys them to bases across the globe, and prefers drone strikes to raids to remove terrorists. At the same time, Country A prefers to use drone strikes without consulting with or seeking the approval of other countries. The only oversight of Country As drone warfare is exercised by its political leaders, who have adopted a target validation process prior to authorizing a strike. Given this information on Country As high use of drone warfare, as well as its preference to use drone strikes as it deems fit, consider the following scenario. Country A, acting alone, conducts a drone strike in Country B against a terrorist. The strike results in one civilian casualty but removes the terrorist who had been planning to attack Country A.\n\nScenario #4 Treatment (Tactic, Unilateral): Although Country A can afford to adopt drone warfare as a key pillar of its national security policy and military strategy, it does not embrace drone strikes as anything more than a tactic against terrorists on the battlefield. Country A has a small number of drones, does not deploy them to bases across the globe, and prefers raids to drone strikes to remove terrorists. At the same time, Country A prefers to use drone strikes without consulting with or seeking the approval of other countries. The only oversight of Country As drone warfare is exercised by its political leaders, who have adopted a target validation process prior to authorizing a strike. Given this information on Country As little use of drone warfare, as well as its preference to use drone strikes as it deems fit, consider the following scenario. Country A, acting alone, conducts a drone strike in Country B against a terrorist. The strike results in one civilian casualty but removes the terrorist who had been planning to attack Country A.\n\nControl Scenario (No variation in use and constraint): Country A uses drone warfare to kill terrorists abroad. Given this information, consider the following scenario. Country A conducts a drone strike in Country B against a terrorist. The strike results in one civilian casualty but removes the terrorist who had been planning to attack Country A.\n\na.

Horizontal bars represent 95 percent confidence intervals about each point estimate, which are shown by experimental groups for both graphs. Bars that cross the dashed line at zero indicate no statistically significant results for treatment groups relative to the control group, which is the baseline. All point estimates were calculated using a Welchs T-Test (two-tailed) that estimates the difference in mean responses between the experimental groups and the control group.\n\nSurvey Completion Times by Experimental Groups:\n\nNote: This figure depicts the average survey completion time, in minutes, for respondents assigned to each experimental group. The heightened response time for respondents assigned to group four suggests \"cognitive wrestling,\" which implies that respondents may have transitioned to deliberate moral reasoning given a clash of intuitions.\n\nMultivariate Regression Analysis:\n\nPublic Perceptions of Legitimacy Group 1 0.27 (-0.33, 0.87) Group 2 1.11*** (0.49, 1.74) Group 3 -0.11 (-0.70, 0.47) Group 4 0.13 (-0.47, 0.74) Sex 0.34* (-0.05, 0.73) Education 0.09* (-0.004, 0.18) Political Ideology 0.07 (-0.04, 0.18) Support to the Use of Force 1.15*** (0.91, 1.38) Belief in the Role of Great Powers 0.18* (-0.02, 0.37) Constant -0.27 (-1.57, 1.02) W 546 R2 0.24 Adjusted R2 0.23 Residual Std.

Those threats become more frequent and overt as Ukrainian counteroffensives gain momentum and the Russian military cedes territory. As President Biden stated on October 11, 2022 in response to some of these recent threats, the U.S. is now faced with the first credible threat of nuclear escalation in a generation. Unipolarity fostered an environment in which use of nuclear weapons rarely entered sober public discourse. In a way this is comfortingnuclear deterrence proved successful. On the other hand, much of the body of knowledge surrounding nuclear escalation is untested theory derived from Cold War-era assumptions. Analysis of the progression of the war in Ukraine suggests that legacy escalation theory, when reframed for geopolitical context and the modern character of warfare, remains relevant and can provide insights into the future direction of the conflict.\n\nEscalation Theories and Metaphors\n\nA useful theory of nuclear escalation should suggest how and under what conditions actors are likely to pursue more extreme means of coercive force. Nearly sixty years ago, Herman Kahns On Escalation proposed a simple and plausible framework for understanding escalation as a competition in risk taking, like a game of chicken. An actor escalates because it believes that the other side may find the risks associated with the escalation untenable and subsequently relent. Of course, the act of escalating carries the inherent risk that ones opponent may be incentivized to raise the stakes and escalate further. Continued escalation is particularly likely when actors face existential threatsthe risk of de-escalation is greater than that of escalationor are at a disadvantage at the current level of conflictthe risk of maintaining the status quo is greater than escalation.\n\nThe core of Kahns theory is the \"escalation ladder,\" a graphic and narrative metaphor of iterative ways and means, progressing from interstate disagreement to nuclear Armageddon. His intent was to \"facilitate the examination of the growth and retardation of crises.\" Kahn was quick to point out that his escalation ladders were a tool to aid in understanding and contextualizing but should not be considered as a rigid template for every crisis. To that end, he identifies 44 \"rungs\" representing increasingly risky, provocative, and violent behavioral options, grouped into seven units. The work is an important glimpse at influential early-Cold War scholarship which has informed strategy and analysis for the better part of a century, and persists in influencing security discourse.\n\nThe persistence of Kahns 60-year-old theory raises important questions for scholars. Is this persistence a sign of superlative explanatory power or of analytical stagnation and untestable theses? How well can Cold War-era theory explain escalation behavior in the information age? Has the character of warfare evolved to an extent that undermines the theorys assumptions of state decision calculus? The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine serves as a case study to examine whether modern great power escalatory behavior comports with Kahns framework.\n\nThe Road to War and Beyond\n\nIn many ways, the buildup to the invasion and first several months of the war followed an escalation progression that closely parallels Kahns ladder. The 2014 Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea, and persistent low-intensity conflict in the Donbas are important context. Putins subcrisis maneuvering progressed over years and commenced by establishing a crisis (rung 1) as grounds for conflict. These grounds were further laid by suggesting through political, economic, and diplomatic actions (rung 2), as well as rhetorical repetition that the crisis represented a threat to vital Russian interests (rung 3). The crisis progressed to what Kahn would call \"traditional crisis\" in January and February of 2022, as Russian threats became increasingly pointed and frequent (rung 4). Deliberate and systematic escalation manifested as Russian troops massed on Ukraines borders (rungs 5 and 6) and manufactured \"dramatic military confrontations,\" ostensibly to coerce Kyiv to accept terms (rung 9). The \"harassing acts of violence\" in the Donbass increased significantly, surrounding the recognition of the Luhansk and Donetsk Peoples Republics on February 21 (rung 8).\n\nThe invasion, or \"intense crisis,\" began on February 24 with a flurry of escalatory activity, the penetration of Ukraines borders (rung 12) being only the most visible. Notably, diplomacy was maintained until the day of the invasion, when President Zelensky announced the severing of diplomatic ties (rung 10). Almost simultaneously, Ukraine announced general mobilization. Ukraines deferral of both moves until the invasion began suggests a desire by Kyiv to avoid escalation and deny Moscow a pretext for invasion. The \"large conventional war\" phase of the conflict persisted for months as initial Russian objectives proved unrealistic and the war became one of attrition. A form of compound escalation has flared up periodically in the form of Russian missile attacks against civilians far from the fight (rung 13). Finally, the annexation of Donetsk and Luhansk in early October 2022 represented a de facto declaration of limited conventional war (rung 14). Up to that point, Moscow scrupulously framed the war as a \"special military operation.\" Annexation of the territories reframes Russian military actions there as defensive. Thisdesperate and Orwellian as it may beis significant in that Russia has committed to defending the breakaway republics just as it would its own homeland.\n\nThe Current State of the War\n\nThe present state of the conflict is one of conventional, attritional war punctuated with what Kahn would understand as references to \"barely nuclear\" war (rung 15) and \"nuclear ultimatums\" (rung 16). The Kremlins recent accusation that Ukraine is attempting to create a dirty bomb, despite being an obvious fabrication, creates a pretext for \"barely nuclear\" war. Kahn envisioned this sort of activity as an \"accidental or unauthorized\" use of nuclear weapons, but a false flag dirty bomb might just as easily serve the purpose. It would certainly be escalatory in a conventional sense and could potentially erode the nuclear taboo. Moscows vague and increasingly frequent references to using nuclear weapons serve to \"shatter the illusion that unthinkable means impossible,\" to use Kahns description of nuclear ultimatums. On Escalation places little escalatory stock in threats that are \"vague and heavily qualified,\" yet Putins nuclear saber-rattling has garnered a tremendous amount of attention from the international community.\n\nGoing up?\n\nThat Putin would be willing to cut his losses at this point seems improbable. Likewise, the Ukrainian government insists that it will not negotiate or cease fighting until Ukraines territorial integrity, including Crimea, is restored. Many of Russias prior escalatory measures fell flat because they either failed to credibly convey a sufficient level of risk or because they underestimated Ukrainian risk tolerance. Assuming that Russia is not induced to the negotiating table and that Ukraine continues to retake its territory through grinding offensives, Putin has significant motivation to escalate the conflict. The conflicts potential for further escalation is bound not by capability, but by Moscows appetite for risk as it relates to international response.\n\nA Strong Ladder\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine case study suggests that Kahns escalation framework holds up when adapted to the unique characteristics of the conflict, as the author intended. While a handful of rungs were skipped over or occurred later than Kahn modeled, the ladder proved a relevant framework. Kahn explained that the unique dynamics of each conflict would result in deviations from his model, and exhorted analysts to adapt the ladder to fit relevant circumstances. In applying Kahns escalation ladder to the war, observers should note two important modifiers: the relative power dynamics between the competitors, and the character of the conflict of warfare generally.\n\nFirst, the power dynamics between the competitors are critical context for understanding escalatory behavior in any given conflict. While Kahn had great power competition between nuclear-armed states in mind when crafting his escalation ladder, the current conflict is one in which Russia has a near monopoly on escalation. Russian behavior may be less constrained because the risk of Ukraine escalating to a higher rung is remote. The Russian risk calculus, therefore, is not based on credibility of further Ukrainian escalation, but on the risk of drawing third parties further into the conflict. Ukraines supporters, therefore, have a stake in ensuring that escalation is managed while supporting the objectives and autonomy of the Ukrainian people.\n\nSecond, Kahns ladder tracks surprising closely to the sequence of events in Ukraine which have, fortunately, been at the lower end of the risk continuum thus far. Kahns metaphor may likewise be useful in projecting credible paths to rungs higher on the ladder. As strategists and decisionmakers on all sides weigh how best to achieve their ends while managing risk, they would do well to consider how the structure of a modern escalation ladder reflects developments in warfare. As geopolitical norms and the character of war evolve, conceptions of escalation dynamics evolve in stride. New rungs emerge, old ones disappear, and the rungs assume new orders. Still, 60 years on, Kahns escalation ladder remains strong.",

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nWASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden has been adamant that the United States will back Ukraine in its nine-month fight to repel a Russian invasion. But he has insisted, \"we will not fight the Third World War in Ukraine.\"\n\nSo when a missile struck a village in Poland near the Ukraine border on Nov. 15 and there were early claims it was launched by Russia, he and his top team of advisers were jolted into crisis mode. The United States and other NATO nations would be obliged to defend fellow NATO member Poland militarily if it were a Russia attack - a situation that could escalate into the global war most wanted to avoid.\n\nBiden, in the waning days of a week-long Asia trip, was woken up by aides in the middle of the night in Bali, Indonesia, to let him know that a missile had killed two people in Poland, a U.S. official said.\n\nUkrainian officials publicly blamed Russia, as did a since-corrected Associated Press report, citing an unnamed senior U.S. intelligence official.\n\nThe reports sent stock markets diving and officials scrambling. Eastern European countries responded angrily and the temperature rose.\n\nPreliminary information from U.S. sources indicated that Ukraine may have fired the missile in an attempt to repel a blizzard of incoming Russian missiles and it had accidentally landed in Poland.\n\nAs they sought confirmation, the White House and other U.S. agencies publicly said little. \"We cannot confirm the reports or any of the details at this time. We will determine what happened and what the appropriate next steps would be,\" said White House spokesperson Adrienne Watson.\n\nBehind the scenes, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman was reaching out to some foreign diplomats, asking them to adopt a cautious approach and to be \"measured\" while the United States worked out how it would respond, Western diplomats told Reuters.\n\nFlanked by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security adviser Jake Sullivan, and wearing a t-shirt and khakis, Biden made an early-morning call to Polish President Andrzej Duda, offering his condolences and support for an investigation, the White House said.\n\nSOME MOSCOW COMMUNICATIONS FAILED\n\nAs tensions simmered, and European allies fretted, the U.S. military tried to reach out to Moscow.\n\nThe Pentagon has stressed the importance of military-to-military communication with Moscow during the nine-month-long Ukraine war.\n\nFor instance, the White House has had talks with Russia about its threats to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, and top defense officials spoke with their Russian counterparts in October after Moscow accused Ukraine of planning a \"dirty bomb\" attack.\n\nBut at the Pentagon on Tuesday, efforts to contact Russia's military failed.\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said his staff tried to arrange a call with his Russian counterpart, Chief General Staff General Valery Gerasimov.\n\n\"Some attempts were made. No success,\" Milley told reporters.\n\n\"My staff was unsuccessful in getting me linked up with General Gerasimov,\" he said.\n\nSullivan, who has been in touch with Russian officials about the risks around the Ukraine invasion, did not make contact in relation to this incident, a White House official said.\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns, who had met with his Russian counterparts at the Russian intelligence agency SVR in Ankara on Monday, was in Kyiv on Tuesday, the day the missiles hit Poland, and traveled to Warsaw the next day.\n\nA U.S. official said that in Ukraine Burns \"discussed the U.S. warning he delivered to the head of Russia's SVR not to use nuclear weapons and reinforced the U.S. commitment to provide support to Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.\"\n\nThe U.S. official said Burns met with officials in Poland and \"discussed the current situation\" but would not comment when asked whether Burns had reconnected with SVR after the Poland incident.\n\nA Kremlin spokesperson said he did not know if Russian channels with the United States were activated to prevent any further escalation but noted that the American reaction was \"restrained.\"\n\nINVESTIGATION\n\nBiden and his aides convened an emergency meeting of G7 leaders at 9am Wednesday morning in Bali to discuss the incident, where he told them what the United States had learned - that the blast was caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile.\n\nHe was a little more vague answering reporters' questions after the meeting, saying it was \"unlikely\" that the missile was fired from Russia based on its trajectory.\n\nLater, NATO's secretary-general said the blast was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile that went astray but that Russia was ultimately responsible because it started the war.\n\nPoland has been conducting its own investigation into what happened. The U.S. military has sent American explosives experts to the site to help with the probe, at Poland's request, a U.S. official said.\n\nThe official said the investigation is expected to conclude fairly quickly that Ukraine fired the missile. \"It's now just a matter of doing forensics work to determine what kind of missile it was,\" the official said.\n\nUkraine has insisted there was a \"Russian trace\" in the blast and has sent its own experts to the site to investigate.\n\nThe incident highlights just how dangerous the Russian invasion of Ukraine is for Europe, and the rest of the world, observers said.\n\n\"Poland and the Baltics have been warning for some time that there is a real risk of something happening that draws the West into a wider conflict,\" said one European diplomat. \"What happened on Tuesday makes it clear that this war is not managed, it is not controlled.\"\n\nReporting by Steve Holland and Phil Stewart; additional reporting by Michael Martina, Nandita Bose and Andrea Shalal; Editing by Heather Timmons and Rosalba O'Brien\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Nikita Chibrin, 27, said that he spent more than four months in Ukraine as part of the 64th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, a unit accused of committing war crimes in the Kyiv region in March. Chibrin landed in the Spanish capital on Tuesday and was being held at the airports immigration centre. In a phone interview from the airport on Wednesday evening, Chibrin denied involvement in the reported war crimes of his unit, saying he did not fire a gun \"once\" while in Ukraine. Nikita Chibrin served in the 64th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, a unit accused of committing war crimes near Kyiv in March. Photograph: Supplied He said he was eager to testify in an international court about his experiences in Ukraine. \"I have nothing to hide,\" he said. This is a criminal war that Russia started. I want to do everything I can to make it stop. Chibrin said he decided to flee Russia after deserting from his unit in Ukraine in June. According to Chibrin, he told his commanders of his opposition to the war on 24 February, the first day of the invasion. Chibrin says he was removed from his rank as an army mechanic after he spoke out and was then tasked with performing manual labour. \"They threatened to jail me. In the end, my commanders decided to use me as a cleaner and a loader. I was placed away from the battlefield,\" he said of his time in Ukraine. The Guardian has not been able to verify all the details of Chibrins story independently. Chibrin has supplied documents and photographs showing he was stationed with the 64th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade in Ukraine.

Borrell told Reuters: I am afraid Russia is not ready to withdraw and as far as it doesnt withdraw, peace will not be possible.

A joint Polish and US investigation had begun at the site, outside the village outside the rural eastern Polish village of Przewodow, about four miles from the Ukrainian border. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy yesterday said he had no doubt that the blast was not caused by a Ukrainian missile, adding that he believed Ukraine should already have been given access to the site.\n\nUpdated at 11.52 EST\n\n17 Nov 2022 11.16 EST Blinken: Russia ultimately responsible for Poland missile incident The US secretary of state Antony Blinken said an investigation into Tuesdays missile incident in eastern Poland was ongoing but that the US had \"seen nothing so far that contradicts\" Polands preliminary assessment that Ukrainian air defences were to blame for the border blast. However, Blinken reiterated: Whatever its final conclusion, we already know the party ultimately responsible for this tragic incident Russia. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, talks to reporters during a press conference at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC summit.

Ukraine has the right to defend itself and we are committed to supporting Ukraine.

The blast in Poland was certain to be raised.\n\nMeanwhile, Poland confirmed early Wednesday that a missile fell in the countrys east, as US President Joe Biden said it was \"unlikely\" it was fired from Russia.\n\nIn their statements, Poland and NATO used language that suggested they were not treating the missile blast as an intentional Russian attack, at least for now.\n\nA NATO statement called it a \"tragic incident\".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy initially decried the explosion as \"a very significant escalation\" and prompted Biden to call an emergency meeting of G7 and NATO leaders.\n\nA deliberate, hostile attack on NATO member Poland could trigger a collective military response by the alliance.\n\nBut questions around the rocket remained, especially since the incident came during a blistering series of Russian missile attacks across the nearby border in Ukraine, none larger than who fired it.\n\nRussia denied any involvement in the Poland blast and summoned the Polish charg daffaires.\n\nPreliminary assessments suggest the missile was launched by Kyivs forces at an incoming Russian one in the crushing salvo against Ukraines electrical infrastructure Tuesday.\n\nThat assessment and Bidens comments at the G20 summit in Bali contradict information earlier Tuesday that Russian missiles crossed into Poland.\n\nSoon after the blast, a statement from the Polish foreign ministry identified the weapon as being made in Russia. President Andrzej Duda was more cautious, saying that it was \"most probably\" Russian-made, but that its origins were still being verified.\n\nBy Wednesday, he changed track altogether, saying the rocket was likely part of Ukraines defence mechanism.\n\nThe Kremlin accused some Western countries, especially Poland, of reacting \"hysterically\", but praised Biden for showing restraint.\n\n\"We have witnessed another hysterical, frenzied Russophobic reaction, which was not based on any real data,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"I want to invite you to pay attention to the rather restrained reaction of the Americans, which contrasted with the absolutely hysterical reaction of the Polish side and a number of other countries,\" he said.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry claimed the photos of the wreckage published on Tuesday evening were \"unequivocally identified by Russian defence industry specialists as elements of an anti-aircraft guided missile of the S-300 air defence system of the Ukrainian air force.\"\n\nStill, US defense secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday also said Russia \"bears ultimate responsibility\" for the incident, while adding the Biden administration has \"full confidence\" in Polands investigation.\n\nFor his part, Zelenskyy said he believed Tuesdays explosion was caused by a Russian missile, adding that he based his conclusions on reports from Ukraines military which he \"cannot but trust\".\n\n\"I have no doubt that it was not our missile,\" he said, according to Interfax Ukraine news agency.\n\nHe argued Ukraine should already have been given access to the site of the explosion. \"Do we have the right to be in the investigation team? Of course,\" he said.\n\nKyiv on Wednesday requested access to the site of the deadly blast.\n\n\"Ukraine requests immediate access to the site of the explosion,\" the secretary of Ukraines national security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said on Twitter.\n\nHe added that Ukraine has evidence of a \"Russian trace\" in the explosion, without giving any details.\n\nDanilov said Ukraine wanted a joint study of Tuesdays incident with its partners and to see the information that provided the basis for its allies conclusions.\n\nKyiv is \"completely open to a comprehensive study of the situation,\" he wrote on the councils official Facebook page.\n\nDanilov echoed Zelenskyy in blaming Russias \"missile terror\". He provided no details of what evidence he was citing when he referred to a \"Russian trace\" behind the incident.",

Few military experts believe Ukraine, despite recent successes, could take the highly defended Russian positions, including Crimea, before February with an expected winter slowdown in the fighting.\n\nMacron also said the immediate task was to do everything to help Ukraine resist, and regardless of the source of the stray missile that landed in Poland on Tuesday, Russia had fired as many as 85 missiles into Ukraine that day in an attack on its energy infrastructure. He described it as \"a terrible day for the Ukrainian people\", and possibly designed as a message to members of the G20.\n\nA draft declaration issued from G20 leaders at the close of the summit said \"most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine\" and demanded Russias \"complete and unconditional withdrawal\" from its neighbours territory. The reference to war is a rejection of Russias claim that it is involved in a \"special military operation\".\n\nBut the draft also said, \"There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions,\" reflecting the divisions among G20 states over Russia. China and India have both refrained from outright criticism of the Kremlins invasion.\n\nMacron said: \"The G20 has not looked away from the war in Ukraine. Even if Vladimir Putin did not come, the message sent to him was very clear, the vast majority condemns the war in Ukraine. That is a fact.\"\n\nHe added that behind the scenes at the summit there had been a growing consensus. \"There is space of convergence, including with the major economies China and India, to push Russia to de-escalate.\n\n\"We have brought together Senegal, Rwanda, South Africa, Argentina and Mexico to create convergences and have a clear message vis-a-vis Russia, a complete call for Russia to end this war.\"\n\nBut he repeatedly said there was a consensus that the war must end in negotiations. He has previously said, and faced criticism for saying, that the war cannot end in humiliation for Russia, a remark he has not recently repeated as Russias methods have become ever more brutal.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At his press conference he said he was convinced that Xi was sincere, and upheld the UN charters support for the sovereignty of nations. The summit represented a formal end to Xis diplomatic isolation caused by Covid, and the west led by the US clearly is in a mood to reopen lines of communication.\n\nSceptics say that Putin and Xi committed themselves to a partnership without limits very soon before the invasion, and China has done little to distance itself from Russia subsequently. But Chinese sources told the FT they felt they were lied to by Putin, remarks that implied a weakening in the relationship.\n\nG20 leaders left Bali relieved that the missile that landed in Poland, killing two people, was most likely a Ukrainian air defence missile, rather than a deliberate Russian provocation, but the episode underlined the vulnerability of the Eastern borders of Nato. \"It is an instructive lesson in how fragile this state of affairs remains\", said one European diplomat.\n\nMacron was at the forefront of western efforts at the summit to connect with the global south, saying he supported the African Union becoming a full permanent member of the G20. He also vowed to hold a new international conference on a financial pact with the south in Paris in June with the aim of creating a boost in finance to the south.\n\n\"We must not ask these countries to support multilateralism if the system is not able to respond to these vital emergencies. He also hailed the likely long term renewal of the grain and fertiliser deal allowing exports from Ukraine and Russia to be renewed by the end of the year.",

The officials were not identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nMr. Trudeau would not comment on the origin of the missile, saying an investigation needed to take place, but said Russia had obviously chosen \"to thumb its nose\" at the G20.\n\n\"One thing is absolutely clear, whether it was direct or indirect responsibility, Russia is responsible for what happened because Russia chose to launch over 100 missiles while we were gathering to talk about the consequences of this illegal war on the global economy, to call for peace.\"\n\nAfter a discussion with representatives of NATO and the European Union early Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said, \"Were going to make sure we figure out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Then were going to collectively determine our next step as we investigate and proceed.\"\n\nMr. Biden also condemned Russias \"totally unconscionable\" strikes against Ukraine Tuesday, saying that at a time \"when the world came together at the G20 to urge de-escalation,\" Russia had \"chosen to escalate in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe missile barrage followed a Monday visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the recently liberated city of Kherson and his address to the G20 summit.\n\nIn a prerecorded video, he outlined a 10-point peace plan and called for a special tribunal to investigate Russian war crimes. He compared the liberation of Kherson to the D-Day landings \"not yet a final point in the fight against evil, but it already determined the entire further course of events.\"\n\nThe speech was criticized by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at a news conference for Russian state media later the same day. Mr. Lavrov said Kyiv, not Moscow, was standing in the way of peace.\n\nHe also accused Western countries of trying to \"politicize\" the G20 leaders joint declaration by trying to add \"statements that would condemn the actions of the Russian Federation on behalf of the entire G20.\" He said such matters were \"not on the agenda and not in the competence of the G20 group.\"\n\nMr. Lavrov left Bali Tuesday, before the final day of the conference, as Russian missiles were striking Ukraine.\n\nThe focus on Ukraine proved frustrating for some G20 countries, which would have preferred prioritizing economic matters, particularly given the ongoing ramifications of the pandemic.\n\nIn their statement, G20 leaders said they were \"deeply concerned by the challenges to global food security exacerbated by current conflicts and tensions.\"\n\n\"We therefore commit to taking urgent actions to save lives, prevent hunger and malnutrition, particularly to address the vulnerabilities of developing countries, and call for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems and supply chains,\" they said.\n\nPart of that includes an agreement brokered by Turkey and the United Nations to secure the transport of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea. Speaking to reporters in Bali on Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said discussions were \"ongoing\" to renew that deal, which is due to expire Nov. 19.\n\n\"As for now I am of the opinion that this will continue, there is no problem regarding this,\" he said. \"As soon as I go back, I will be on the phone with Mr. Putin.\"\n\nMr. Erdogan noted that \"extremely high energy, food and raw material prices seem to be pushing all economies to the brink, without any discrimination whatsoever.\"\n\nMany of the leaders who gathered in Bali came directly from Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, where they attended the COP27 climate conference. In their joint statement, they reiterated a \"commitment to achieve global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions/carbon neutrality by or around mid-century.\n\n\"We call for continued support for developing countries, especially in the most vulnerable countries, in terms of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy,\" they said.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S., Canada, and a number of other developed countries agreed to a deal with Indonesia to help that country expedite its transition away from coal-fired power generation.\n\nThe fourth-most populous country in the world and the largest economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia currently relies on coal for some 60 per cent of its energy. The new deal, worth US$20-billion, would bring forward that sectors peak emissions date by seven years, to 2030.\n\n\"Indonesia is committed to using our energy transition to achieve a green economy and drive sustainable development,\" President Joko Widodo said. \"This partnership will generate valuable lessons for the global community.\"\n\nMr. Trudeau praised the G20s work on climate change, saying his government was committed to supporting Indonesia in its efforts.\n\nWith files from Reuters and the Associated Press",

Meanwhile, the president of France told Asian business leaders that the conflict is \"your problem\" too. DW has the latest.\n\nMillions of Ukrainians were left without power on Friday after Russia bombarded the country's electricity grid a day earlier.\n\nThe damage comes as Kyiv and other cities recorded their first snowfall of the winter. It follows a similar barrage on Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Friday that half the country's energy system has been disabled by Russian attacks. He also met with European Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis to discuss Russian attacks on Ukrainian enegry infrastructure.\n\nMykola Povoroznyk, the deputy head of the Kyiv city administration, said in televised comments on Friday that they were preparing for different scenarios, \"including a complete shutdown.\"\n\n\"Currently, more than 10 million Ukrainians are without electricity,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday.\n\nThat constitutes almost a quarter of the pre-war population of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy said the regions of Odessa, Vinnytsia, Sumy and Kyiv were the hardest hit. Many towns reported injuries and deaths.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said on Friday it downed two cruise missiles, five air-launched missiles and five Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in the past 24 hours.\n\nIn addition to crippling the electricity grid, other energy infrastructure was also affected by the airstrikes.\n\nThe head of state energy company Naftogaz, Oleksiy Chernishov, said Russia \"launched a massive attack on gas production infrastructure\" in eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said on Friday that its airstrikes on Thursday targeted energy infrastructure and what it claimed were \"missile manufacturing facilities.\"\n\nRussia launches new wave of missile strikes To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHere are the other main headlines from the war in Ukraine on Friday, November 18:\n\nKyiv says experts working at Polish blast site\n\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukrainian experts were on site in Przewodow, the Polish border town where two were killed after en explosion caused by a missile.\n\nKyiv had maintained that it was a Russian attack, while the US and Poland have said the missile likely originated with Ukraine's air defense.\n\nOn Twitter, Kuleba wrote, \"Ukraine and Poland will cooperate constructively and openly on the incident caused by Russian missile terror against Ukraine.\"\n\nKyiv's air defense was triggered by a barrage of over 80 missiles Russia fired at critical infrastructure and residential targets in Ukraine. It is believed the air defense missile veered off course after fired at an incoming Russian missile.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda warned Poland could expect further fallout from Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\n\"Unfortunately we have to be prepared in a sense for accidents to happen again on our border as a consequence of the war,\" Duda said.\n\nRussia 'fortifying' Crimea\n\nRussia said on Friday it is fortifying its positions on the Crimean peninsula.\n\n\"Fortification work is being carried out on the territory of Crimea under my control with the aim of guaranteeing the security of all Crimeans,\" the Moscow-installed governor of the region, Sergei Aksyonov, posted on social media.\n\nRussia annexed Crimea in 2014. Russian military and naval bases on the peninsular have been subject to drone attacks in recent months.\n\nMost APEC nations condemn Russian invasion\n\nThe 21 countries at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bangkok, Thailand, have released a joint declaration in which most members condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine \"in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\n\"Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy,\" the joint statement read.\n\nBut, it added that \"there were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions.\"\n\nThe statement uses almost identical phrasing to the G20 declaration that was made two days earlier in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nSweden finds evidence of Nord Stream sabotage\n\nInvestigators in Sweden found traces of explosives at the site of the damaged Nord Stream pipelines, a prosecutor said on Friday.\n\n\"It is a case of serious sabotage,\" the Swedish Security Service said.\n\nIt added that \"the extensive damage to the gas lines as a result of the detonations have been extensively documented.\"\n\nSwedish authorities did not blame any country or other entity in their findings.\n\nThe Nord Stream 1 pipeline was a major source of Russian gas for the European Union. Underwater explosions in September took the pipeline offline and contributed to the energy crisis caused by Russias invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMacron tells Asia 'this war is also your problem'\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has urged Asian countries to join the \"increasing consensus\" condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking at the a gathering of business leaders on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Bangkok, the French president said \"this war is also your problem.\"\n\nHe said France wanted to create a stronger global consensus against the war in order to prevent further destabilization in different regions.\n\nPope willing to mediate peace\n\nPope Francis reiterated his offer to mediate peace between Ukraine and Russia in an interview with Italy's La Stampa newspaper on Friday.\n\nHe said the Vatican is ready to do anything to stop the war.\n\n\"But everyone must commit to demilitarizing hearts, starting with their own, and then defusing, disarming violence,\" the Pope added.\n\n\"We must all be pacifists. Wanting peace, not just a truce that may only serve to rearm. Real peace, which is the fruit of dialogue.\"\n\nCanada to issue $500 million bond to support Ukraine\n\nThe Bank of Canada announced plans to issue a five-year $500 Canadian million (361 million or $374 million) bond dubbed the \"Ukraine Sovereignty Bond\" that offers the chance to directly support Ukraine.\n\nThe bond will be issued later this month.

                "cc_text": "On Tuesday, Russia conducted nearly 100 missile strikes on military targets and the civilian power grid in Western Ukraine. Ukraine responded with its air defense missiles, shooting down about 70 of the Russian missiles. One Ukrainian woman was killed when a missile struck a residential area, and Ukraines already strained energy infrastructure sustained extensive damage.\n\nUnfortunately, this exchange of rockets over the skies of Ukraine would have been an unexceptional day in the eight months since this war began. Except, this time, one of those rockets strayed from the intended battlefield into NATO territory. A Ukrainian air defense missile did not hit its intended target but instead struck Przewodw, a rural village in Poland just a few kilometers from the Ukrainian border, killing two people.\n\nInitially, it wasnt clear where the missile had come from or why. Confusion and fear reigned in the following 24 hours. An early Associated Press alert reported that a senior US official attributed the stray missile to Russia. Ukraines government echoed this interpretation, calling the attack a \"significant escalation\" that required a heightened NATO response. Russia denied that the missile was theirs and called it a \"deliberate provocation in order to escalate the situation.\" Polands response was more subdued, acknowledging that it would not have definitive evidence of the missiles origin until it could investigate further.\n\nThis crisis illustrates the concept of the fog of war. This phrase was first used in the 19th century to describe how it is impossible to have perfect information during a conflict. You can never be certain what an adversary has done, what an adversary can do, and what an adversary intends to do. Leaders must make decisions in this fog, and often they are pressured to make decisions when the fog is thickest, when they have the least information about what has happened.\n\nThe information environment becomes even more clouded in the age of social media, when rumors and disinformation spread faster than wildfire. In the hours following the crisis, government officials, experts, and amateurs were alight with speculation on Twitter, trading theories and accusations.\n\nIt was perhaps fortunate that, when this crisis developed, many world leaders had already assembled. The G20, a forum of the worlds 19 largest economies and the European Union, were meeting for a two-day summit in Bali, Indonesia. The morning following the missile strike, US President Biden called for an emergency meeting with present NATO members. From this discussion, leaders emerged with a united message: before any action is taken, facts must first be established through a calm and careful investigation.\n\nA few hours later, Polands president announced that the rocket which had struck Poland had not originated from Russia but from Ukraines air defense system. The missile strike on NATO soil was a tragic accident caused by an unjust war, not a deliberate attack by Russia. For now, fears of escalation have calmed.\n\nThis incident underscores how crucial it is that leaders remain calm and steady in times of crisis. Decisions must be made with incomplete information, often in unideal circumstances. In this case, President Biden had just flown across the world to attend an important diplomatic summit in a time zone 13 hours ahead of DC. After a full day of events and meetings, he would have been jet-lagged and exhausted. He was shaken awake in the middle of the night to learn that a missile had struck a NATO ally that it might have come from Russia that the choices he made could impact whether this was the beginning of a major war between Russia and NATO.\n\nIt isnt difficult to imagine, in those circumstances, how easy it would be to speak or act hastily, to make the wrong decision with limited information. Thats what makes the fog of war so dangerous. And in the nuclear age, the time constraints on decision-making are much greater, while the consequences of a mistake could be unimaginably high. Because the United States and Russia keep hundreds of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert, leaders might believe they have only minutes to decide how to respond to a possible nuclear strike.\n\nSince the outbreak of Russias war on Ukraine, experts have worried about the scenario of inadvertent escalation when the effects of battle spill out from Ukraines borders. Even if Russia and NATO do not intend to escalate this conflict, escalation cannot always be controlled.\n\nAs long as Russia wages a war at NATOs borders, the risk of these kinds of incidents will continue. But we are not helpless. Right now, we should model the calm that we want to see from our leaders. We will need steady hands to see us through this war and the crises to follow.\n\nHowever, we dont just need wise leaders; we can and must lower the risks that unintended escalation leads to catastrophe. The United States could do so in several ways. We could take our land-based missiles off hair-trigger alert. We could make sure that that the decision to launch is not placed in the hands of just one person. We could make clear that we will never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict. We cannot eliminate conflict; we cannot eliminate uncertainty; but we can make sure that existential threats to humanity are not balanced on the judgment of a single person woken up in the middle of the night.",

                "cc_text": "After meeting Xi Jinping last week, Joe Biden did his best to paint a rosy image of US-China relations. \"As the leaders of our two nations,\" he said, \"we share a responsibility to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever near conflict and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation.\"\n\nOn paper, Bidens words appear to be an encouraging sign of thawing tensions. The truth, however, is that the US-China relationship is at its lowest point since they established diplomatic relations in 1979. And much of the blame for that lies with the Biden administration.\n\nWhile tensions between the two superpowers have been simmering for years, the new administration has taken the confrontation with China to a whole new level. Since he was elected, Biden has taken a much more hard-line approach to Taiwan than Trump, further boosting ties with the country and undermining the \"One China\" policy, under which the US acknowledges that \"China maintains there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China\", but doesnt recognise Chinas sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nBiden has also made clear he believes the US should come to Taiwans defence if China were to launch an invasion irresponsible remarks that have led the White House to clarify this would fall short of American military intervention. And yet, the presence of US warships in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea has increased significantly this year, to which China has responded by launching extensive military exercises around the self-ruled island. Admiral Michael Gilday, US Chief of Naval Operations, last month went as far as saying that the United States should be prepared \"for a 2022 window or potentially a 2023 window\" for war over Taiwan with China.\n\nDespite such inflammatory statements, the chances of an all-out war between the US and China remain remote just like those of a US-Russia conflict. Yet one cannot help but find the notion of a US administration openly raising the possibility of conflicts with the worlds two largest nuclear superpowers at the same time, and acting in ways that make such conflicts more likely, deeply alarming. Even more worrying, the Pentagons recent Nuclear Posture Review opened the door to the possibility of a first-strike attack by US nuclear forces.\n\nTaiwan is not the only issue on which Biden is escalating tensions with China. Last month, he also launched what Edward Luce has appropriately called \"a full-blown economic war on China\", by introducing a vast array of restrictions on the sale of semiconductor chips to Chinese firms, as well as on the equipment needed to make them. Given the US controls some of the most critical nodes of the global semiconductor supply chain, such as advanced chip research and design, and that China still relies on imports for much of its high-end chip consumption, the impact on the country could be significant affecting not only the production of goods that require semiconductors but also Chinas ability to produce its own chips.\n\nThe potential impact of these measures becomes apparent when we consider the extent to which semiconductors have become the lifeblood of modern societies. As the historian Chris Miller writes in his new book Chip War: \"Microchips are the new oil the scarce resource on which the modern world depends. Today, military, economic, and geopolitical power are built on a foundation of computer chips.\" All of which means the US embargo could potentially hinder Chinas ability to produce a large swathe of goods not the best news for the world at a time of high inflation driven, in part, by supply chain bottlenecks.\n\nThe overlapping nature of the economic and military dimensions of the measure becomes apparent when we consider that more than 90% of the worlds supplies of advanced chips are produced by a single company, Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which happens to be located in Taiwan. This partly explains the heightened tensions around the island. It also means the ban could have serious geopolitical implications, potentially prohibiting Taiwan from selling semiconductor manufacturing equipment and advanced chips to Chinese companies.\n\nThat said, China already produces about 15% of semiconductors globally, and its only a matter of time before it figures out how to produce more chips on its own, even at the higher end of the technological scale. Some analysts even believe the move may actually end up hurting the US and its Western allies more than China, in a way not dissimilar to the way in which anti-Russian sanctions have ended up dramatically backfiring on Europe, further disrupting global supply chains that were already severely unsettled by the pandemic and then the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nYet such economic reasoning has its limits. Many in the US establishment view war with China as inevitable, and so the move could be understood as a way to primarily weaken Chinas military capabilities in view of the \"big one\": a US-China military confrontation. As US Strategic Command head Admiral Charles Richard recently said: \"This Ukraine crisis that were in right now, this is just the warm-up. The big one is coming. And it isnt going to be very long before were going to get tested in ways that we havent been tested in a long time.\" This may be seen simply as an attempt by the Pentagon and to ramp up fears in order to increase their bloated budgets. But ballooning defence budgets also tend to be self-fulfilling, increasing the demand for actual wars.\n\nThe most appalling aspect of all this is that theres nothing inevitable about a US-China war. If China represented a security threat to Americas survival, this might be the case. But it does not. The problem with China, as the recently released US National Security Strategy emphasised, is that it is the only competitor of the US with \"the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favour of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit\", meaning the US should aim to \"out-compete\" China. The Pentagons latest National Defense Strategy also concludes that China \"remains our most consequential strategic competitor for the coming decades\", due to its \"coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavour to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences\".\n\nIn other words, China is not a threat because it undermines US security interests, but because it will want to shape and indeed is already shaping the global political and economic order in a manner that serves its own interests, rather than just those of the US and other Western nations, as has been the case since the Second World War. The real threat, then, is not to America but to Americas hegemonic unipolarist ambitions and those who benefit from it. Recognising this is not about being \"anti-China\" or \"pro-China\" its about acknowledging that a peaceful world order rests on our ability, as Westerners, to accept a more equitable distribution of global resources, and to tolerate different national cultures, institutional arrangements and practices, even if we find them disagreeable.\n\nAnd yes, this will also depend on Western countries becoming less reliant on far-flung countries and overstretched supply chains for the provision of a wide range of industrial goods. But the current trend towards deglobalisation and reshoring in itself a positive thing, given the disastrous consequences of hyperglobalisation on Western workers and manufacturing bases is not driven by the desire to create more just, sustainable and self-sufficient economies, but rather by the desire to crush Chinas rise, even at the expense of the well-being of Western citizens.\n\nTake, for instance, Bidens focus on boosting Americas chip-making capacity. While semiconductors may be strategically important in \"out-competing\" China, theyre not particularly labour-intensive. Reshoring traditional manufacturing sectors would benefit US workers much more but its not their needs that are driving policy. As the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik writes: \"It is good that we are now moving away from [hyperglobalisation], given how damaging it was to our social fabric Unfortunately, the great powers seem to have chosen a different, even worse path. They are now handing the keys to the global economy to their national-security establishments, jeopardising both global peace and prosperity.\"\n\nThe good news is that the Ukraine crisis has shown that the days when the US could single-handedly dictate global politics are long gone: most countries have not followed America in slapping sanctions on Russia. On the contrary, more than a dozen countries have formally applied to join the BRICS grouping, following its decision to allow new members earlier this year. If accepted, the new BRICS members would create an entity with a GDP 30% larger than the United States, over 50% of the global population and in control of 60% of global gas reserves.\n\nAnd when it comes to the prospect of engaging in a Cold War 2.0 with China, the US appears even more isolated even vis--vis its closest allies. Recent reports suggest that Washington failed to convince its allies to take part in the sanctions and had to proceed unilaterally. This is unsurprising, considering the devastating consequences of Europes ill-advised decision to join the US in waging a proxy war against Russia. Thus Rishi Sunak recently hinted he will abandon plans to declare China a \"threat\" to national security as part of a major review of British foreign policy, while Emmanuel Macron, following a face-to-face meeting with Xi at the G20, made clear (according to Beijings readout) that he \"hopes to continue working with China and deepen cooperation in areas such as trade, economy, aviation and civilian nuclear energy\".\n\nBut the country that has most openly defied US consensus on China is also the one that is suffering the most Germany. A few days after America imposed its sanctions, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that decoupling from China was \"the wrong answer\"; earlier this month, he went to Beijing and met with Xi Jinping, accompanied by a business delegation of powerful German CEOs. In an essay in Politico, Scholz later explained the reasoning behind his trip: \"No country is the backyard of another. What is true in Europe regarding Ukraine is also true in Asia, Africa or Latin America. It is here that new centres of power are emerging in a multipolar world, and we aim to establish and expand partnerships with all of them. Thus, in recent months, we have carried out in-depth coordination at the international level.\"\n\nUnderstandably, many interpreted this as a rebuttal of Americas new Cold War, bloc-minded strategy. It remains to be seen whether this signals Germanys intention to rebuild a trans-Eurasian geopolitical corridor. But it does show that its not China that is becoming increasingly isolated from the world but the United States. The latter would do well to accept that the days of American unipolarity are over, and its attempts to drag the world into a war with China will only accelerate its decline.\n\n***\n\nThe definition of \"One China policy\" has been amended for clarity.",

There had been an explosion in the village of Przewodw near the border with Ukraine. Two people had been killed. Russia was thought to be responsible. The Associated Press cited a senior US intelligence official as saying that Russian missiles had crossed into Polish territory. Polands government ministers rushed into an emergency meeting of the national security council in Warsaw. Polish military units were ordered to a heightened state of combat readiness. If the strike was found to be deliberate, it would mean that Russia had attacked a Nato member, which could then decide to invoke Article Five of the alliances treaty, according to which an attack against one member is considered to be an attack against them all.\n\nOn the other side of the world, the US president, Joe Biden, who was attending the G20 summit in Bali, was woken by his aides. In the early hours of the morning, wearing a T-shirt and looking distinctly sleep-deprived, he spoke by phone with Polands president, Andrzej Duda. Soon afterwards, Biden and the leaders of the other Nato countries at the summit, including the British prime minister Rishi Sunak, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, and French president Emmanuel Macron, gathered. A photograph of the meeting showed the leaders huddled together, their facial expressions uniformly tense.\n\nFrom the outset, Biden urged caution, pointing to preliminary information about the missiles trajectory and questioning whether it could really have been fired from Russia. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, also warned against jumping to conclusions. \"I am calling on all Poles to remain calm in the face of this tragedy,\" he said in a late-night press conference. \"We must exercise restraint.\"\n\nWithin hours, it was clear that the early reports were wrong and that there had been no Russian attack. Investigators concluded that the missile was likely a Soviet-era S-300 rocket fired by Ukrainian anti-aircraft defences in response to the Russian air strikes that had pummelled the country throughout the day. \"This is not Ukraines fault,\" stressed Jens Stoltenberg, Natos secretary-general, who is interviewed on page 24. \"Russia bears ultimate responsibility.\"\n\nRelated\n\n[See also: Letter from Kherson: The war of the villages]\n\nSubscribe to Morning Call View all newsletters The quick and essential guide to domestic and global politics from the New Statesman's politics team.

THANK YOU Close\n\nYet the incident laid bare the usually subterranean tensions between the Ukrainian government and its Western backers. Speaking on television on 16 November, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraines president, insisted that \"it was not our missile\" that struck Poland. He said that he had been personally briefed on the issue by his military leadership, and that he had \"no grounds to doubt them\". When asked about Zelenskys comments on his return to the White House the following morning, Biden responded curtly: \"Thats not the evidence.\"\n\n\"This is getting ridiculous,\" an unnamed diplomat from a Nato country told the Financial Times in Kyiv. \"The Ukrainians are destroying [our] confidence in them. Nobody is blaming Ukraine and they are openly lying. This is more destructive than the missile.\" Zelensky subsequently adopted a more equivocal approach, sending investigators to Poland and conceding that he did not know \"100 per cent\" what had happened. A Ukrainian air force spokesman acknowledged on 18 November that it was possible that at least some of the missile fragments had come from Ukraine as he described an intense battle to defend the country against the Russian bombardment.\n\nThe narrowly averted crisis also focused attention on the danger that the conflict could escalate beyond Ukraine, drawing Nato members into the fighting and leading to a direct confrontation between nuclear powers. This is not a new concern. Since the start of the war on 24 February, the US and its European allies have weighed how to enable Ukraine to defend itself without risking a wider war.\n\nThis calculation played into Natos decision to turn down Ukrainian pleas to \"close the sky\" by enforcing a no-fly zone over the country during the early weeks of the war. When Poland offered to send fighter jets to Ukraine in March, the US similarly shut down the idea, concerned that a Russian attack on the planes during their transfer or on the US air force facility in Germany where they are based could drag Nato into the war.\n\nWashington has also taken a cautious approach to the supply of long-range weaponry to Kyiv, such as the Army Tactical Missile System, which it has refused to send (although it has provided Himars and other powerful rocket systems), wary of facilitating strikes deep into Russia that could be viewed by the Kremlin as crossing a red line. As Biden has reportedly reminded his aides at regular intervals: \"Were trying to avoid World War Three.\"\n\nVladimir Putin has deliberately exploited these fears to deter greater Western involvement. Three days into the conflict, on 27 February, the Russian president was shown on television ordering the countrys nuclear forces to be placed on a \"special regime of combat duty\". The order itself appeared to have no practical effect, but it achieved the desired result of sending chills through European capitals and focusing minds on Russias nuclear arsenal. Putin has returned to his nuclear threats on several occasions since: invoking the US bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, which he said had \"created a precedent\"; and when he announced the \"annexation\" of four new regions of Ukraine in September, promising to use \"all available means\" to defend the territory.\n\nIn addition to this nuclear sabre-rattling, the suspected Russian sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea in September seemed designed to highlight the vulnerability of Europes energy infrastructure if the Kremlin decided to extend the scope of the war. Russia has also threatened to pull out of a United Nations-brokered deal to allow Ukrainian grain and other agricultural goods to be shipped from the countrys Black Sea ports, ending a months-long naval blockade that had exacerbated a global food crisis. \"People cannot be fed with printed dollars and euros,\" Putin warned in his annexation ceremony speech. \"And you cant heat anyones home with inflated capitalisations you need energy.\"\n\nIn other words, he has continually sought to stoke fears of how the conflict could expand beyond Ukraine, and how many others in Europe and around the world could be made to suffer, if he is pushed too far.\n\nThis strategy has proved effective. Comparing the threat to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Biden warned of the prospect of \"Armageddon\" during a speech in October. \"We are trying to figure out: what is Putins off-ramp?\" he said. \"Where does he find a way out?\" Each new Ukrainian victory has been followed by hand-wringing among international observers as to how much further it should attempt to go. Putins decision to begin mobilising Russian citizens and signs that his forces are digging in along more defensible lines in southern and eastern Ukraine where they have been installing concrete fortifications known as \"dragons teeth\" have also raised questions as to how long the West will be able to sustain the current level of support.\n\n[See also: Can the Ukraine war now end only with Russias defeat?]\n\nThose concerns have only intensified as Russia has systematically targeted Ukraines power and water plants, damaging or destroying an estimated 40 per cent of the countrys critical energy infrastructure as winter sets in, with no end to the bombardments in sight.\n\nRenewed shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 20 November, which Kyiv and Moscow blamed on each other, has also increased fears of an accidental catastrophe. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UNs nuclear watchdog, warned that whoever was behind the attack was \"playing with fire\" and that if the plants cooling systems lost power, it could cause a major nuclear disaster.\n\nWhile publicly vowing to support Kyiv for \"as long as it takes\", US officials have also privately urged the Zelensky administration to show that it is open to negotiations with Russia to head off growing \"Ukraine fatigue\" as the conflict enters its tenth month. There has been little domestic political cost for Western governments supporting Ukraine so far. Boris Johnsons repeated visits to Kyiv and public backing for Zelensky during the early months of the war arguably helped him to cling on as prime minister into the summer before he was finally consumed by a tide of scandals and incompetence.\n\nEven Giorgia Meloni, the new far-right prime minister of Italy, has vowed to continue the countrys support for Ukraine, although some Italian commentators have suggested that she faces opposition from within her own party. A relatively mild European autumn has seen gas prices fall and fears of imminent power shortages recede, but Putin will undoubtedly be hoping for a long, cold winter and surging inflation to erode popular support for Ukraine.\n\nIn the US, which has provided the bulk of military and financial support to Ukraine, Biden has asked Congress to approve another $37bn in emergency aid before the Republican Party assumes control of the House of Representatives in January. But a group of Republicans led by the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has already unveiled a resolution calling for an audit of all aid to Ukraine.\n\nPolling carried out by the Wall Street Journal in October found that while a majority of Americans still supported sending aid to Ukraine, 48 per cent of Republicans surveyed said the US was doing too much to help, up from just 6 per cent in March. Donald Trump Jr responded to the missile incident by asking his 9.2 million Twitter followers: \"Since it was Ukraines missile that hit our Nato ally Poland, can we at least stop spending billions to arm them now?\"\n\nYet the problem with the entirely rational focus on how long the West can sustain its support for Ukraine is that it overshadows the much more important question: what will happen if it doesnt? Russias aggression against Ukraine didnt start in February. Even before the first Russian tanks crossed the border earlier this year, more than 14,000 Ukrainians had already died in the war that started in the countrys east in 2014.\n\nI reported extensively from both sides of the front line during the conflict, and I was in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol (currently occupied by Russia) in September 2014 when the first Minsk agreement was signed. The 12-point ceasefire deal, named after the Belarusian capital where it was agreed, was meant to halt the fighting and lead to the withdrawal of heavy weaponry, but on the ground little changed. The shelling continued around us. If anything, it intensified.\n\nNone of the Ukrainian soldiers I spoke to expected the \"ceasefire\" to last, if it even took effect. \"If there is a ceasefire, it will only be from our side, so its meaningless,\" a Ukrainian volunteer sitting on top of an armoured personnel carrier on the outskirts of the city told me. \"Putin cant be trusted,\" said a journalist-turned-soldier named Tatyana, whose husband had been killed in the fighting three weeks earlier. \"We have experience with that.\"\n\nShe was right. The first Minsk deal soon broke down, as did the second, which was signed in February 2015. Ukraine had also signed an agreement with Russia, along with the US and the UK, in 1994, known as the Budapest Memorandum, which was supposed to assure the countrys security and protect Ukraine from the threat or use of force in return for giving up its nuclear weapons. Even if Moscow was showing any real interest in negotiations, which it is not, why would Kyiv view this as anything other than an attempt to pause the fighting to allow the Russian forces to regroup and rearm before resuming their offensive?\n\n[See also: Russia has forgotten historys lessons about waging war in winter]\n\nUkraines reluctance to pursue a new ceasefire deal without \"removing the root causes of the problem\" is based on \"our experience with the Minsk I and II agreements in 2014-15\", Mykola Bielieskov, a defence analyst at the National Institute for Strategic Studies in Kyiv, told me. \"These agreements brought a false sense of normalcy at the expense of Ukrainian citizens and territories and allowed Russia to continue modernising the army and launch a new round of aggression.\" Rather than asking why Ukraine was not more focused on achieving a truce, he said many of the people he spoke to in Kyiv were \"perplexed that Western governments dont want to learn the lessons of dealing with Russia, like the fate of Minsk I and II\".\n\nIt is not only Russia that will be closely studying the Wests actions in the coming months. If domestic political divisions prevail and Ukraines backers falter, other revisionist powers such as China with its military modernisation almost complete and its sights firmly on Taiwan will learn that Western resolve is liable to crumble in the face of any real cost. Beijing will be reassured that its assessment of the West as divided and decadent turned out to be true. Do we really want to send the message to authoritarian regimes, such as North Korea, that neighbouring countries can be invaded and their borders changed by force as long as you possess a suitably powerful nuclear arsenal?\n\nInherent in the idea that it is possible to offer Putin a tempting \"off-ramp\" and a truce deal that will restore lasting peace to Europe in the near term is a desire to time-travel; to go back to an earlier period perhaps the late 1990s or the early 2000s when the post-Cold War order seemed assured and the prospect of large-scale conflict between states appeared to be receding. Russia was instituting democratic elections. China was opening up and joining the World Trade Organisation. North Korea was a communist relic that seemed destined to collapse. But these states learned different lessons from the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. That order was never as durable as it appeared.\n\n\"The post-Cold War era is definitively over,\" said the Biden administrations national security strategy, released in October, \"and a competition is under way between the major powers to shape what comes next.\" That contest is already taking place in Ukraine. The Wests capacity to stay the course and sustain Ukraines ability to fight will determine whether that order is shaped by liberal democratic principles and international norms, or a world of great-power rivalry in which might makes right and Putin and his fellow autocrats learn that they can take what they want with enough force.",

Russia is waging war on electricity and heat for people by blowing up power plants and other energy facilities,\" said Zelenskyy.\n\nIn the southern Odesa region, a Russian raid hit infrastructure and the governor warned residents of the threat of a \"massive\" missile attack, urging them to seek shelter.\n\nThe eastern region of Kharkiv was also struck, governor Oleg Synegubov announced, adding Russia hit \"critical infrastructure\".\n\nThis is their consequence\n\nIn response, Zelenskyy described Russia as a \"terrorist state\" and said Moscow \"wants to bring Ukrainians only more pain and suffering\".\n\nRussia, however, said Kyiv was ultimately to blame for the blackouts.\n\n\"The unwillingness of the Ukrainian side to settle the problem, to start negotiations, its refusal to seek common ground this is their consequence,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\n\"First they negotiate, then they refuse to negotiate, then they pass a law that prohibits any kind of negotiations, then they say they want negotiations, but public ones,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\n\"Therefore, its difficult to imagine public negotiations One thing is for sure: the Ukrainians do not want any negotiations.\"\n\nPeskov said in this context Moscow would continue what it calls a \"special military operation\", and missile raids on targets across Ukraine were the result of Kyiv not being willing to meet at the negotiating table.\n\nA UN agency said a serious humanitarian crisis loomed with millions facing \"constant power cuts\" as Ukraines typically long, cold winter begins.\n\nGrain deal renewed\n\nThe raids on Ukraines power grid follow a series of battlefield setbacks for Russia, including last weeks retreat from Kherson.\n\nHowever, Moscow and Kyiv managed to extend an agreement allowing Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea after the deals looming expiration sparked fears for the global food supply.\n\nThe Black Sea grain initiative will be extended for 120 days, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Nations announced. The agreement provides safe passage for cargo ships using Ukraines Black Sea ports.\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres said the deal was \"essential\" to averting a worldwide food crisis.\n\nRussia confirmed the deal was renewed. \"Any attempts to use the humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea for provocative military purposes will be firmly suppressed,\" its foreign ministry warned.",

In November, NATO agreed to Turkey's request for the deployment of Patriot missiles as a defensive measure\n\nOn 10 February 2002, Turkey invoked the article as a result of the armed conflict in neighbouring Iraq. NATO agreed a package of defensive measures and conducted Operation Display Deterrence\n\nWhat is likely to have happened?\n\nAlthough initial reports suggested the missile was fired by Russia, NATO Secretary General Mr Stoltenberg said in Brussels on Wednesday: \"Our preliminary analysis suggests that the incident was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile fired to defend Ukrainian territory against Russian cruise missile attacks.\n\n\"But let me be clear, this is not Ukraine's fault.

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\nPresident Joe Biden arrives in Washington on Wednesday evening after a whirlwind slate of summits across two different continents his largest opportunity yet to play diplomat-in-chief among other world leaders in a world reemerging from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe trip spanning Egypt, Cambodia and Indonesia for summits focused on climate, Southeast Asia and the global economy came at a tricky moment, challenging the president to balance his attention on both ongoing domestic political battles and the international matters in front of him.\n\nBiden, for instance, would be thousands of miles away from Washington as votes continued to be tabulated in midterm races across the country. He would be in Indonesia while his 2020 competitor and predecessor, former President Donald Trump, announced his third run for the presidency in Florida. And through it all, Biden would try to thread the needle of diplomacy with allies and adversaries who might not know if his brand of foreign policy would stick around for the long term.\n\nBut flying away from Asia on Wednesday, the president departed having been able to celebrate some political victories while abroad, smooth over some of the pricklier dynamics hed faced with key leaders without promising any deliverables and test the mettle of his alliances when an emergency called on them to come together and hatch a plan.\n\nHere are takeaways from Bidens trip:\n\nCooling tensions with China\n\nBiden held three-hour talks on the sidelines of the G20 in Bali on Monday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, their first in-person meeting since Biden took office. The meeting was a chance to smooth over longstanding tensions. Though the two leaders left without resolving the litany of issues that have helped drive the US-China relationship to its lowest point in decades, they committed to reestablishing coordination.\n\nRelations have deteriorated rapidly amid economic disputes and an increasingly militarized standoff over Taiwan. The tensions have led to a decline in cooperation on areas where the two countries once shared common interests, like combating climate change and containing North Koreas nuclear program.\n\nEmerging from the talks afterward, Biden told reporters that both he and Xi were \"open and candid\" about their disagreements. And importantly, Biden cast doubt on an imminent invasion of self-governing Taiwan, and seemed hopeful his message about avoiding all-out conflict was received.\n\n\"Im not suggesting this is kumbaya,\" Biden said at a news conference, \"but I do not believe theres a need for concern, as one of you raised a legitimate question, a new Cold War.\"\n\n\"He was clear, and I was clear that we will defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights and stand up for the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners,\" Biden continued. \"Were going to compete vigorously but Im not looking for conflict.\"\n\nThe White House said in a statement after the meeting that Biden raised concerns about human rights and Chinas provocations around Taiwan. But they found at least one area of apparent agreement that nuclear weapons cannot be used in Ukraine, where that nation is trying to fight off a Russian invasion.\n\nIn a sign both men arrived to meeting hoping to improve the souring relationship, Biden announced his Secretary of State Antony Blinken would visit China and said officials from each country would begin working together through issues. Formal talks on climate cooperation between the US and China are expected to resume as well as part of a broader set of agreements between Biden and Xi, two US officials tell CNN.\n\nChina previously halted talks viewed by the Biden administration as a key area where the two nations must work together as part of retaliation for the visit to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The US and Chinese envoys for climate change are talking, but the Biden administration will see what China is prepared to do to make concrete progress, one of the US officials said.\n\nA midterms boost and Trumps presidential announcement\n\nThe White House had prepared for domestic politics to loom over the trip given Trumps expected announcement and the lag in midterm elections results. The issue, it seems, also hovered in the minds of leaders Biden met with throughout the trip.\n\nBiden brought up the political headwinds working in his favor at the top of Mondays news conference, after it was projected that Democrats would secure their majority in the US Senate.\n\n\"The American people proved once again that democracy is who we are. There was a strong rejection of election deniers at every level from those seeking to lead our states and those seeking to serve in Congress and also those seeking to oversee the elections,\" Biden said.\n\nSpeaking of his time in Asia and meeting with world leaders, Biden said the election has sent \"a very strong message around the world that the United States is ready to play\" and \"fully engaged in the world.\"\n\nThroughout the course of his meetings in Asia, Biden was approached by fellow leaders bearing congratulations following the midterm results, a signal the American political contests were being closely monitored by leaders on the opposite side of the world. It was a phenomenon that surprised some of his aides, particularly the specificity with which many of the leaders were watching.\n\nWhite House officials were also anticipating a split screen moment this week as Biden met world leaders in Bali at the same moment his predecessor was announcing a third presidential run. But the dynamic was amplified as Biden convened the emergency talks over a missile killing two people in Poland at the same hour Trump loyalists filled the Mar-a-Lago ballroom for the former presidents announcement.\n\nTrumps announcement will surely prompt renewed attention on Bidens on decision-making on running for reelection. By all accounts, including from his closest advisers, Biden will feel more propelled to seek a second term if Trump is in contention.\n\nUniting allies around Ukraine and acting quickly on Poland\n\nBiden administration officials had billed the G20 summit as another effort to rally world leaders in support of Ukraine amid Russias ongoing aggression, but the issue reached a new level of urgency when leaders in Indonesia were awoken early Wednesday to reports that a missile had landed in Poland Ukraines neighbor to the west and a NATO ally and killed two people.\n\nNATO and G7 allied leaders at the summit, led by Biden, held and emergency meeting in Bali to discuss their approach to the explosion.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the incident, which marked the first time a NATO country had been directly hit during the almost nine-month conflict, remain unclear.\n\nBiden said after the meeting that preliminary information suggested it was \"unlikely\" the missile was fired from within Russia, but was unable to say conclusively until the investigation was complete. Polands president and the head of NATO have both said Wednesday that its likely that the missile strike was accidentally caused by Ukrainian air defenses, with no sign that it was a intentional attack on Poland.\n\nAt the G20 a group of nations, including Russia, broadly focused on the global economy Russias international isolation grew as world leaders issued a joint declaration condemning its war in Ukraine.\n\nThe summit concluded Wednesday with a leaders statement that \"deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe 17-page document is a major victory for the US and its allies who have pushed to end the summit with a strong condemnation of Russia, though it also acknowledged disagreements among member states.\n\n\"Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy,\" it said. \"There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions.\"\n\nThe passing of the joint declaration would have required the buy-in from leaders that share close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin most notably Xi, who declared a \"no-limits\" friendship between their countries weeks before the invasion, and Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nWhile India is seen to have distanced itself from Russia, whether there has been any shift of position from China is less clear. Xi has called for a ceasefire and agreed to oppose the use of nuclear weapons in a flurry of bilateral meetings with Western leaders on the sidelines of the G20, but he has given no public indication of any commitment to persuade Putin to end the war.",

That's why we need...access to all the data that our partners have and the site of the explosion,\" Zelensky said in his nightly address.\n\nZelensky had earlier said Kyiv had not seen proof that the missile was Ukrainian and that it was imperative that Kyiv become part of an investigation.\n\n8:29pm: Top US general says Ukraine unlikely to reclaim all territory seized by Russia\n\nThe top US general has said there's a low probability that Ukraine can militarily force Russia to leave all of the Ukrainian territory it occupies, including Crimea.\n\n\"The probability of a Ukrainian military victory defined as kicking the Russians out of all of Ukraine to include what they claim as Crimea the probability of that happening anytime soon is not high, militarily,\" Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a news conference in Washington.\n\n\"Politically, there may be a political solution where, politically, the Russians withdraw. That's possible,\" he added, saying Russia \"right now is on its back\".\n\n8:08pm: CIA chief meets Polish president\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda met CIA chief William Burns in Warsaw this evening, according to the head of Poland's National Security Bureau.\n\n\"In the evening, President @AndrzejDuda talked with the head of the CIA, William Burns, who is in Warsaw after his visits to Ankara and Kyiv,\" Jacek Siewiera wrote on Twitter. \"The conversation concerned the general security situation, the context of recent events came up.\"\n\nWieczorem Prezydent @AndrzejDuda rozmawia z szefem CIA Williamem Burnsem, ktry po wizytach w Ankarze i Kijowie jest w Warszawie.

Zelensky said the CIA head had spent time in a bomb shelter before the two men met.\n\n6:58pm: US sees 'nothing that contradicts' Polish assessment on missile blast\n\nThe US has not seen anything that contradicts Poland's preliminary assessment that a missile which landed within its borders on Tuesday was most likely the result of a Ukrainian air defence missile, said US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.\n\n\"Whatever the final conclusions may be, it is clear that the party ultimately responsible for this tragic incident is Russia, which launched a barrage of missiles on Ukraine specifically intended to target civilian infrastructure,\" Watson said, adding that Ukraine had every right to defend itself.\n\n5:51pm: Ukrainian missile did not cause blast in Poland, Zelensky tells local media\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been quoted by Interfax Ukraine news agency as saying he had no doubt that an explosion that killed two people in Poland was not caused by a Ukrainian missile.\n\n\"I have no doubt that it was not our missile,\" he was quoted as telling Ukrainian media.\n\n5:32pm: Kherson tries to resume some 'semblance of normal life'\n\nNearly a week after Russian troops withdrew from Kherson, the city is still trying to regain some semblance of normal life, said FRANCE 24s Luke Shrago, reporting from the southeastern Ukrainian city. \"The city is still without power, heat and water.

He however said \"protecting the Ukrainian sky\" would be a priority at a planned meeting with allies in Germany.\n\n\"Together with our partners were working on an integrated & echeloned air defence system. We are preparing for winter on the battlefield,\" he wrote.\n\nProtecting the sky is our priority #1 and topic #1 at #Ramstein 7.\n\nTogether with our partners were working on an integrated & echeloned air defense system.\n\nWe are preparing for winter on the battlefield.\n\nThank you @SecDef for leading the international coalition against evil. pic.twitter.com/tqX5E6jhNX Oleksii Reznikov (@oleksiireznikov) November 16, 2022\n\n4:56pm: Czechs plan to train to 4,000 Ukrainian troops\n\nThe Czech government plans to provide training to as many as 4,000 Ukrainian troops over the next year, said Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova.\n\nThe training would be done in five four-week cycles with up to 800 troops attending each, and cost 975 million crowns ($41.60 million), the Defence Ministry said.\n\nThe training programme would be started with the first batch of troops this year and eventually be folded under a planned EU training scheme for Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has shown interest in training of mainly mechanised battalions and also medics, engineering and chemical troops, Cernochova said.\n\n4:47pm: Russia summons Polish envoy after missile incident\n\nRussia has summoned thePolish ambassador to Moscow to the foreign ministry, said ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova following Tuesday's deadly incident in a Polish border village.\n\n\"The Polish ambassador has been summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry,\" Zakharova said in a statement, after Warsaw said it was likely that the missile was launched by Ukraine but that Russia was ultimately to blame.\n\nEarlier the Kremlin accused Poland of reacting in \"absolutely hysterical\" fashion to Tuesday's incident when two people were killed by a missile in eastern Poland.\n\n3:43pm: Ukrainian access to missile probe needs Polish, US approval, says Poland\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda said both Poland and the US would have to agree to Ukraine's participation in the investigation into a missile that hit a Polish border village, killing two people.\n\n\"The proceedings are conducted by Polish and American experts and if anyone was to be allowed to take part in these proceedings it would need at least the agreement of both parties,\" Duda told a news conference.\n\n3:02pm: An accident waiting to happen\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has expressed his solidarity with Poland and has cautioned that more analysis of the circumstances around Tuesdays deadly blast was required. FRANCE 24s Douglas Herbert explains that, \"the circumstances under which this happened are during an intensifying conflict, a conflict which the G20 leaders meeting in Bali recognise as a Russian invasion of Ukraine in their final statement it was an accident waiting to happen and its exactly the kind of scenario NATO has feared\" since the February 24 start of the invasion.\n\n02:47\n\n1:27pm: Ukraine seeks access to site of Poland missile strike\n\nUkraine wants access to the site of an explosion in eastern Poland which Western officials say was probably caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile, a senior Ukrainian defence official said on Wednesday.\n\nOleksiy Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, said Ukraine wanted a joint study of Tuesday's incident with its partners and to see the information that provided the basis for its allies' conclusions.\n\n12:51pm: 'Changes very little' if Poland blast was not due to Russia, Italy's Meloni says\n\nItaly believes it does not make much difference if the missile that caused a deadly explosion in Poland was not Russian, because Moscow is still to blame for attacking infrastructure in Ukraine, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Wednesday.\n\nTalking to reporters at the G20 summit in Bali, Meloni said she spoke to Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.\n\n\"The possibility that the missile falling on Poland was not a Russian missile but a Ukrainian one changes very little,\" she said.\n\n12:50pm: 'No indication of deliberate attack' on Poland, NATO's Stoltenberg says\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday a deadly explosion in Poland was probably the result of Ukrainian anti-aircraft fire but that Russia bears \"ultimate responsibility\" for the war.\n\n\"An investigation into this incident is ongoing, and we need to await its outcome [...]. But we have no indication that this was the result of a deliberate attack,\" Stoltenberg said after chairing a meeting of NATO ambassadors.\n\n\"Our preliminary analysis suggests that the incident was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile fired to defend Ukrainian territory against Russian cruise missile attacks.\"\n\n12:27pm: Poland says missile that struck border village 'very likely' from Ukraine's air defence\n\nPoland's President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday said it was \"very likely\" that the deadly missile that struck a Polish border village was from Ukraine's air defence.\n\n\"Absolutely nothing indicates that this was an intentional attack on Poland ... It's very likely that it was a rocket used in anti-missile defence, meaning that it was used by Ukraine's defence forces,\" he told reporters.\n\nDuda described the blast in the village as most likely an unfortunate accident. He also said that the ultimate responsibility lies with Russia, which launched a barrage of missile attacks on Ukraine on Tuesday.\n\n11:59am: Germany offers to aid Polish air patrols after rocket strike\n\nGermany said Wednesday it could send its own warplanes to support patrols over Poland following a deadly rocket strike in a village close to the border with Ukraine.\n\n\"As an immediate reaction to the incidents in Poland, we will offer to strengthen air policing with combat air patrols over its airspace with German Eurofighters,\" defence ministry spokesman Christian Thiels said at a regular press conference. \"This can happen from tomorrow, if Poland so wishes.\"\n\n11:43am: Ukraine races to restore power after Russian missile barrage\n\nPower was fully restored on Wednesday in seven Ukrainian regions, including in the capital Kyiv, less that 24 hours after a Russian missile barrage on energy infrastructure across the country.\n\nWork to restore electricity was also under way in seven other regions, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine's presidential administration.\n\nHe wrote on the Telegram messaging app that emergency cut-offs were still possible, and national grid operator Ukrenergo said it was implementing planned outages across the entire country as repair work continued \"around the clock.\"\n\n11:32am: Macron urges China to play 'greater mediation role' on Ukraine\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday urged China to play a \"greater mediation role\" to help avoid an escalation of the Ukraine war, a day after talks with his Chinese counterpart.\n\n\"China can play a greater mediation role, alongside us, in the coming months,\" said Macron, adding that he had discussed a possible trip to China early next year with President Xi Jinping.\n\nChina has declined to put pressure on Moscow over its nearly nine-month-old invasion, and helped shield Russia from diplomatic censure at forums such as the United Nations.\n\n11:14am: Macron says US has shared information on Poland blast, 'but we must remain careful'\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday the US had shared preliminary information about the missile blast in Poland but that it was too early to say what happened.\n\n\"There is preliminary work that was shared by the United States but we must remain careful,\" he told a news conference in Bali after a G20 summit.\n\n10:54am: 'Convergence within G20 to push Russia towards de-escalation', Macron says\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said at a press conference at the G20 summit in Indonesia on Wednesday that there is a \"convergence within the G20 that Russia must be pushed towards de-escalation\" in its war against Ukraine, after Poland said that two Russian-made missiles fell on its territory on Tuesday, killing two people.\n\nMacron said that France expresses \"full solidarity\" with Poland and that it will \"cooperate\" with Warsaw to find out exactly what happened.\n\n10:23am: Biden said Ukraine air defence missile responsible for Poland blast, NATO source says\n\nUS President Joe Biden told G7 and NATO partners that a missile blast in Poland was caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile, a NATO source told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nThe blast raised global alarm that the Ukraine conflict could spill into neighbouring countries.\n\n9:56am: G20 summit host Indonesia says Ukraine war most debated part of leaders' declaration\n\nThe war in Ukraine was the most debated article of a declaration of G20 leaders who gathered at a summit this week, the Indonesian president said on Wednesday, while urging all sides not to escalate tensions further.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo added the war had caused devastation and huge human suffering and weighed on global economic recovery.\n\n9:27am: NATO holds emergency talks after missile lands in Poland\n\nAmbassadors from the 30 NATO nations gathered in Brussels Wednesday for emergency talks after Poland said that a Russian-made missile fell on its territory, killing two people, and US President Joe Biden and his allies promised support for the investigation into the incident.\n\nThe blast came as Russia launched widespread aerial strikes across Ukraine and immediately raised concern and confusion about whether Russia might be broadening the war it launched in Ukraine in February, potentially dragging NATO into the conflict.\n\nBut three US officials said preliminary assessments suggest the missile was fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian projectile, and Biden said it was \"unlikely\" that it was fired from Russia. NATO chief spokeswoman Oana Lungescu described the blast as a \"tragic incident\".\n\nPoland said late Tuesday that it was considering calling for emergency consultations under Article 4 of NATOs founding treaty, which provides for such talks if one of the 30 allies considers that its territory might be under threat. But Wednesdays meeting did not appear to include Article 4 consultations.\n\n9:14am: G20 leaders end meeting condemning war but note divisions\n\nG20 members ended their meeting Wednesday by declaring that most of them strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and warning that the conflict is intensifying fragilities in the world's economy.\n\nThe summit's closing declaration was noteworthy in highlighting the war given the divisions among the group, which includes not only Russia but also countries such as China and India that have significant trade ties with Moscow and have stopped short of outright criticism of the war.\n\nStill, the declaration acknowledged \"there were other views and different assessments\" and stated that the G20 is \"not the forum to resolve security issues\".\n\n9:44am: Fuel depot explodes in southern Russia\n\nA fuel depot exploded on Wednesday in southern Russia near Ukraine following a suspected drone attack, Russian authorities said.\n\nThere were no casualties reported in the alleged attack which took place some 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the Ukrainian border in the province of Oryol.\n\n\"Today (Wednesday) at 04:00 (0100 GMT) a suspected drone blew up a fuel depot in the village of Stalnoi Kon. There were no casualties,\" the governor of the Oryol region, Andrei Klytchkov, said in a statement posted on Telegram.\n\nSince the launch of the Russian offensive in Ukraine, several fuel or ammunition depots in southern Russia have been attacked by drones or helicopters, with the Russian authorities blaming Ukrainian forces.\n\nMost of the attacks occurred against targets only tens of kilometres from the border, which makes Wednesday's incident stand out for taking place deeper into Russian territory.\n\n9:18am: Germany's Scholz calls for Poland missile strike inquiry\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday a missile strike in eastern Poland near the Ukrainian border, in which two people were killed, should be fully investigated before conclusions are drawn.\n\nIn his closing statement following the G20 summit in Bali, Scholz called it a positive sign that the US had offered to assist Poland with the probe.\n\nScholz welcomed the clear language found at the summit to condemn the war in Ukraine, adding: \"The Russian president is almost alone in the world with his policy.\"\n\n9:17am: Lithuania calls for more air defences along NATO's eastern border\n\nNATO should swiftly deploy more air defences on the Polish-Ukrainian border and the rest of the alliance's eastern flank, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Wednesday after Tuesday's missile strike that killed two people in Poland.\n\n\"Lithuania will be actively support deploying (NATO) air defences along the Polish-Ukrainian border,\" Nauseda told reporters, adding that this also applied to the rest of the eastern flank.\n\n\"I hope by next year's NATO summit in Vilnius we will be able to make progress, as the situation confirms it is the right decision and needs swift implementation\", Nauseda said.\n\n9:11am: UK, Canada stress importance of full probe into Poland missile strike\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to stress the importance of a full investigation into a missile strike on Poland, Sunak's office said on Wednesday.\n\n\"The prime minister and Prime Minister Trudeau emphasised the importance of a full investigation into the circumstances behind missiles falling in Poland yesterday,\" Sunak's office said, after the two leaders spoke to Zelensky from the G20 summit in Indonesia.\n\n8:42am: NATO envoys hold emergency meeting on Poland blast\n\nNATO ambassadors will hold an emergency meeting at 0900 GMT on Wednesday to discuss a missile strike in eastern Poland close to the Ukrainian border that killed two people on Tuesday, two NATO officials and a European diplomat said.\n\nThe Brussels gathering will be chaired by Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who will hold a news conference around 1130 GMT, NATO said, amid concerns that the incident could be a trigger for the Ukraine war to spill into neighbouring countries.\n\nNATO member Poland said the rocket landed on a grains facility in a village about 6 kilometres from the border. NATO allies were quick to express concern and support.\n\n8:38am: Cuban president to meet Putin next week in Moscow\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin next week in Moscow, the RIA News agency reported on Wednesday, citing the Cuban ambassador.\n\n8:38am: Zelensky tells G20 leaders 'terrorist state among you'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told G20 leaders Wednesday there was a \"terrorist state\" among them, accusing Russia of a missile strike on Poland that killed two people.\n\nSpeaking by video link, Zelensky called the strike \"a true statement brought by Russia for the G20 summit\", according to a copy of his speech seen by AFP. Poland has said there is no clear evidence on who launched the missile.\n\n8:31am: China urges 'calm' after missile strike in Poland\n\nChina on Wednesday called for \"calm\" following a deadly missile strike on a Polish village near the border with war-ravaged Ukraine.\n\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular press briefing: \"Under the current situation, all relevant parties should stay calm and exercise restraint to avoid escalation of the situation.\"\n\n8:31am: 'Problem for the Russians is they always categorically deny'\n\n\"We're still not absolutely certain where that rocket came from,\" said FRANCE 24's Chief Foreign Editor Robert Parsons. \"It does seem certain that it was of Russian provenance, but that doesn't mean of course that Russia fired it, because Ukraine uses Russian rockets [...].\n\n\"At the moment, it's beginning to look as though the rocket was fired from within Ukraine itself, which rather suggests it was a response by the Ukrainian armed forces to that missile attack that took place on Tuesday a massive wave of rockets; at least 90 cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, as well as drones in which case it's either a rocket that went off course or struck a Russian rocket and then fragments of it landed in Poland.\n\n06:10 \"We're still not absolutely certain where that rocket came from,\" FRANCE 24 Chief Foreign Editor Robert Parsons said. France 24 screengrab\n\n\"The problem, I think, for the Russians here is that they always categorically deny [...] So in the past we've had them deny that they were responsible for assassinating Russian agents [Sergei] Skripal in Britain and [Alexander] Litvinenko; they denied they shot down the Malaysian airliner [in 2014]; they denied that they invaded Crimea in 2014; they denied they were going to attack Ukraine earlier this year [...] So suspicion will fall on Russia even if they're innocent.\"\n\n8:29am: Sweden promises $287 million Ukraine military aid package\n\nSweden said on Wednesday it would deliver military aid worth 3 billion Swedish crowns ($286.98 million) to Ukraine.\n\nDefence Minister Pal Jonson told a news conference the package would include an anti-aircraft system.\n\n7:34am: Polish military on high alert after missile strike\n\nPoland's military was on high alert Wednesday after a deadly missile strike on a village near the border with war-ravaged Ukraine.\n\nWestern leaders held an \"emergency roundtable\" on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, where they urged against jumping to any conclusions about the origins of the strike.\n\nThe talks came after Poland's President Andrzej Duda said there was no clear evidence of who fired the missile that killed two people in the southeastern village of Przewodow, near the border with Ukraine.\n\nHe also said the missile was \"most probably Russian-made\".\n\n7:12am: G20 leaders' declaration denounces Russian aggression against Ukraine\n\nG20 leaders made a declaration on Wednesday saying they \"deplore in the strongest terms\" Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe declaration, approved on Wednesday, said most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine but there were other views. It said international law must be upheld and the threat of the use of nuclear weapons was inadmissible and welcomed the Black Sea grain initiative.\n\n7:10am: Erdogan says he believes Ukraine grain exports will continue\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday he believed a deal allowing Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea that is set to expire Saturday would remain in place.\n\n\"I am of the opinion that it will continue. There's no problem there,\" Erdogan told a press conference at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nUkraine is one of the world's top grain producers, and Russia's invasion of the country blocked 20 million tonnes of grain in its ports before the United Nations and Turkey brokered the deal in July.\n\nErdogan said he would speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin as soon as he returned to Turkey.\n\n6:43am: Incident in Poland an attempt to provoke military clash between NATO and Russia, Russian mission to UN says\n\nThe incident in Poland, a blast in a village near the border with Ukraine that killed two people, is an attempt to provoke a direct clash between Russia and NATO, the head of the permanent mission of Russia to the UN said on Wednesday.\n\n\"There is an attempt to provoke a direct military clash between NATO and Russia, with all the consequences for the world,\" Dmitry Polyansky said on his Telegram channel.\n\n6:42am: Blinken calls Polish, Ukrainian FMs over missile attack\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken called his Polish and Ukrainian counterparts on Wednesday after a deadly missile strike in Poland, pledging coordination as \"we determine appropriate next steps\".\n\n\"We pledged to remain closely coordinated in the days ahead as the investigation proceeds and we determine appropriate next steps,\" Blinken said in a tweet as US President Joe Biden met allies on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali to discuss the blast.\n\n6:42am: Biden, Sunak call Russian bombing of Ukrainian civilians 'barbaric'\n\nUS President Joe Biden and his British counterpart Rishi Sunak called Russian President Vladimir Putin's targeting of Ukrainian civilians \"barbaric\" on Wednesday at a G20 summit in Bali.\n\n\"At a moment when world leaders here in Bali are seeking to make progress on world peace, Putin is striking civilian targets children, women. I mean, it's almost my words, not yours barbaric,\" Biden said at a meeting with Sunak.\n\nThe British prime minister, meeting Biden for the first time since taking office, said: \"I agree with your words barbaric.\"\n\nThey were speaking as tensions spiralled over the deaths of two people when a missile hit inside Poland, across the Ukrainian border.\n\n6:40am: France urges 'utmost caution' on origin of Poland strike\n\nFrance urged \"utmost caution\" Wednesday on the origin of a deadly missile strike on NATO member Poland, saying many countries in the region have similar weapons.\n\n\"It's logical that we approach the question with utmost caution,\" a French presidential official said.\n\n\"Identifying the type of missile won't necessarily identify who is behind it,\" the official said, warning of the \"significant risks of escalation\".\n\n\"This is a subject where we don't want to make a mistake,\" the official added.\n\n6:28am: Indonesian leader tells G20 meeting that countries must 'stop the war'\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo, the chair of the G20 major economies, said on Wednesday that countries must \"stop the war\" in opening remarks at a meeting during the G20 summit.\n\nHis comments come amid discussion on the economic impacts of the war in Ukraine and concerns about a blast near Poland's border with Ukraine.\n\n4:34am: Poland likely to invoke NATO's Article 4, will raise missile blast with UN\n\nPoland is likely to request consultations under NATO's Article 4 after a missile, reportedly Russian-made, struck Polish territory near the border with Ukraine, and raise the issue at a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday, officials said.\n\nTwo people were killed in an explosion in a village 6 kilometres (3.5 miles) from the border, with Polish President Andrzej Duda saying that Poland had no conclusive evidence showing who fired the missile.\n\n3:52am: UN chief warns against escalating conflict in Ukraine\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted early Wednesday that he was \"very concerned by the reports of a missile exploding on Polish territory\".\n\nThe UN chief added that \"it is absolutely essential to avoid escalating the war in Ukraine\".\n\n.@antonioguterres is very concerned by the reports of a missile exploding on Polish territory.

Special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Moscows interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was in full swing, and the media pulsated with stories of alleged Russian spies, collusion, and plots to undermine U.S. democracy.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, a little-known Russian journalist arrived in Washington with a bold plan to test the limits of U.S. freedom of speech. Special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Moscows interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was in full swing, and the media pulsated with stories of alleged Russian spies, collusion, and plots to undermine U.S. democracy.\n\nAlexander Malkevich was the latest emissary of Russias hopes for poisoning U.S. political discourse, this time using a news site called USA Really, tied to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the wealthy ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin behind the infamous social media \"troll factory\" and sponsor of the mercenary outfit Wagner Group. Unlike previous Russian influence efforts, Malkevich spoke openly about his plans, which included opening an office a block from the White House. \"I want to make this media interesting and very much involved in the everyday life of Americans,\" he told Foreign Policy in an interview at the time. \"And maybe, in some years I can be a Pulitzer Prize winner.\"\n\nHis lofty ambitions were short-lived. Malkevich was ejected from his officea WeWorkjust hours after he arrived. Facebook shuttered the publications page within a day of its launch, and his attempts to hold a protest in front of the White House sputtered out. After being sanctioned by the Treasury Department later that same year, his days of headline-grabbing sojourns to the United States were over.\n\nIt is tempting to write Malkevich off as a bumbling provocateur. But his career trajectory is a microcosm of Russias move-fast-and-break-things approach to its overseas influence operations. Despite his inauspicious start, Malkevich was back in the headlines a year later after founding the Foundation for National Values Protection, which the State Department has described as seeking to \"facilitate global influence operations on behalf of Yevgeniy Prigozhin.\" Malkevich trained his sights on Africa, where political instability, suspicion of former colonial powers, and a lack of oversight from social media giants provided an opening for Moscow to expand its reach through official and unofficial means. The State Departments Rewards for Justice program now offers a $10 million bounty for information about Malkevich and his activities.\n\nMalkevich is just a single node in a worldwide influence network engineered by the Kremlin and its allies over the past decade, as Russia has assiduously sought to reestablish itself as a player of consequence on the world stage and undermine the West. The end goal has been clear from the start: \"To end American primacy in world affairs,\" said Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow with the Washington Institute. The toolkit has spanned conventional statecraft such as diplomacy, espionage, and the leveraging of natural resources to more shadowy means including covert political interference, cozying up to the far right, and the use of mercenary groups.\n\nIts always been tough to determine just how successful Moscow has been as it claws at countries weak seams, be it racial tensions, inequality, or xenophobia. But Russias invasion of Ukraine has put these influence efforts to the test as Moscow seeks to undermine support for Kyiv, advance its own narrative about the war, and bolster its relationships in the global south in search of new markets to shore up its heavily sanctioned economy.\n\nThe question of whether it has worked will likely be answered in the coming months as the war drags into winter and Kyivs Western partners grapple with spiraling energy prices, stiff economic headwinds, and an uphill battle to win hearts and minds in the developing world. It will have profound implications for Ukraine and the rest of the world.\n\n\"What were seeing now play out are all these strands coming together,\" said Angela Stent, author of Putins World: Russia Against the West and with the Rest. \"Given the situation Russia is in, in terms of its poor performance in this war, its quite remarkable that they still maintain all of these partnerships and relationships with different countries and groups.\"\n\nToward the end of his second term as Russian president, Putin took to the stage in the ballroom of the resplendent Hotel Bayerischer Hof at the 2007 Munich security conference to deliver a speech that would reverberate for years. Taking aim directly at the United States, he decried a world where \"there is one master, one sovereign.\" It was the clearest iteration at that time of the Russian leaders darkening worldview, but it wasnt until he returned to the presidency in 2012 that he began in earnest to try to reshape the global order.\n\nWhile the overarching goal of Russias foreign policy has remained steadfast over the past decade, its means have been marked by flexibility, relentlessness, and at times a sadistic creativity. Earlier this year in Mali, the French military captured drone footage of Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group staging a mass grave using real bodies at the site of a former French military base before attempting to use social media to pin the blame on Paris.\n\nIn the West, as diplomatic ties soured in the wake of Russias annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow has relied on a spectrum of underhanded tactics to curry favor and sow division, from attempting to overthrow the government of Montenegro in 2016 to leaking thousands of emails from French President Emmanuel Macrons campaign on the eve of his election in 2017.\n\n\"Across the board, there have been different wake-up calls,\" said Kyllike Sillaste-Elling, undersecretary for political affairs at the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nSince 2014, Russia has spent more than $300 million in covert financing of political parties across four continents, according to a U.S. intelligence assessment released earlier this year. Such sums are a drop in the ocean by the multibillion-dollar standards of U.S. elections, but they have the potential to go a lot further amid comparatively lean election spending elsewhere. In Europe, Moscow has sought to inflame political sore spots from Catalonias independence aspirations to tensions over immigration, all while courting fringe political figures on the far left and right. Before they were banned by the European Union in March in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, Russias state-backed broadcasters RT and Sputnik put out a steady drumbeat of disinformation, amplified by constellations of fake social media accounts.\n\nThe shadowy nature of Russias exploits makes it difficult for Western countries to respond in kind. \"The activities themselves are often not serious enough for you to respond in any sort of major way, if you dont want to risk a really dangerous escalation, but its also not so insignificant that you can do nothing,\" said Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nIn Germany, the cozy relationship between the Kremlin and former German Chancellor Gerhard Schrder gave rise to a new word\"Schrderization\"which has been used by analysts to describe the Kremlins efforts to win over European elites. As one of his last acts as chancellor in 2005, Schrder signed a deal giving the green light for the construction of the first Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany, bypassing Ukraine and the Baltic states. Shortly after leaving office, Schrder received a call from Putin himself asking him to become chairman of the company overseeing the pipelines construction, and he later went on to work as a lobbyist for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline.\n\nThe project would go on to become a lightning rod within Europe and in Germanys relationship with the United States, where successive administrations argued that the pipeline would leave Europe dangerously dependent on Russian gas while depriving Ukraine of much-needed transit revenues. After years of fraught diplomacy, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz suspended completion of the pipeline in February when it became clear that Putin was on a war footing. But even as the pipeline lay unused, it was still utilized to send a message to Europe when a series of explosions ripped through both Nord Stream 1 and 2 in September, underscoring the vulnerability of the continents critical infrastructure in its northern seas. Although investigations are ongoing, suspicion quickly fell on Moscow.\n\n\"Theres one thing to bear in mind, and thats that the Russians are opportunistic,\" Braw said. \"Its highly unlikely that eight, 10, 12 years ago they thought, Well build a pipeline, and then in the year 2022, well sabotage it.\"\n\nAs tensions rose with the West following Russias annexation of Crimea, Moscow sought to deepen its relationships with countries beyond the West, using a hybrid approach that included more conventional diplomacy as well as a suite of shadowy tactics. Facing Western sanctions, Moscow bolstered its ties with China while the Russian militarys intervention in the Syrian civil war in support of embattled President Bashar al-Assad in 2015 heralded Russias return to the chess board of the Middle East. \"Putin was determined not to let the United States topple another dictator,\" Borshchevskaya said.\n\nAnalysts will often describe Putins approach to his overseas exploits as playing a weak hand well, a maxim best exemplified by Russias decadelong effort to make inroads in Africa. By conventional metrics such as trade, investment, or foreign aid, Russias presence on the continent pales in comparison to those of the United States, China, and Europe. But by lending out its Wagner mercenaries and its expertise on political interference, Moscow has made itself indispensable to authoritarian regimes and power players from Libya to the Central African Republic, giving Russia outsized influence. In Africas Sahel region, which has experienced seven coups in just over two years, Russian disinformation networks tied to Prigozhin have sought to co-opt conversations about decolonization to stoke animosity toward France, the former colonial power in the region, while simultaneously calling for a greater Russian presence.\n\n\"Its very cheap, and its a very good return on investment,\" said a French official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThere was a moment in the spring, as Russia pounded Ukrainian cities with missile strikes, when it seemed like the Kremlins years of trying to weave a global web of influence had amounted to nothing. In a rare display of global unity, 141 countries voted to condemn the Russian invasion at an emergency meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, while Europe underwent in months the kind of shifts that usually take a generation. Germany halted completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and vowed to ramp up its defense spending. Sweden and Finland abandoned their long-standing policies of nonalignment and applied to join NATO, while the EU put on a unified front to impose a series of increasingly punitive sanctions on Moscow and welcome millions of Ukrainian refugees.\n\n\"If the [General Assembly] vote tells you anything, and if the state of European policy tells you anything, it seems like in the end you can have all the influence networks you want, [but] if you do something so egregious, that network isnt going to be able to deliver because its so beyond the pale,\" said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist with the Rand Corporation.\n\nPerhaps the single most glaring failure of Moscows efforts to bend a country to its will is Ukraine itself. With extensive shared historical, linguistic, and cultural ties, Ukraine, in theory, should have been the easiest country for Moscow to woo. For decades, Russia invested heavily in maintaining a network of proxies at all levels of Ukrainian society, while the countrys intelligence agencies were widely reported to be infiltrated by Moscows spies. But the more stifling the Kremlins embrace became, the more Ukrainians pulled away, leading Russia to resort to an all-out invasion in a bid to permanently bring Kyiv to heel.\n\n\"If you have to keep invading your neighbor to get them to do what you want, its a sign of the weakness of your other means of statecraft,\" Charap said. Not only did Russia fail to keep Ukraine within its orbit using a whole suite of influence and coercion tactics, it catastrophically misread how the country would respond to an invasion, as the opening phase of Russias military campaign appears to have been predicated on the assumption that Kyiv would fold within a matter of days.\n\nHeading into the winter, Europe faces spiking energy prices, high inflation, and the possibility of a recession. Protesters have already taken to the streets across Europe in response to the spiraling cost of living. Many analysts fear that such tensions could provide an inroad for Russia to sow discord and undermine European support for Ukraine.\n\nThe election of a far-right coalition government in Italy, composed of parties with a history of being sympathetic toward Moscow, served as a stark reminder of how the consensus-based decision-making style of the EU and NATO could be easily disrupted by just one member, although new Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has vociferously supported Ukraine. For now, at least, current and former European officials are bullish about the fractious blocs ability to hang together.\n\n\"Actually, Im quite optimistic,\" said Mikk Marran, the former head of Estonias Foreign Intelligence Service. \"Im quite optimistic. I think that the West has been considerably or quite united.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the rest of the world, current and former Western officials see an uphill battle in efforts to isolate Putin as the global south contends with rising food and energy prices sparked by a war in which they have no immediate stake. While Biden called for Russia to be expelled from the G-20 group of the worlds leading economies in March, Putin received a standing invitation to the groups meeting in Bali this week as its host, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, tried to tamp down tensions over the war.\n\n\"It seems like a lot of this so far has worked out,\" Stent said. \"What it hasnt done is help their military performance, but it has enabled them to maintain a global influence and a global presence, which is not necessarily warranted by the nature of their economy and their form of government.\"\n\nWhile few countries beyond the global gallery of roguesBelarus, Iran, North Koreahave openly sided with Moscow, many have proven willing to compartmentalize the war from their wider relationship with Russia. India and China abstained from both U.N. General Assembly votes condemning Russias actions in Ukraine, while Beijings diplomats and state media have echoed the Kremlins talking points about the war. As Western nations have frantically sought to cut their dependence on Russian oil, Asian economies, most notably India, have capitalized on heavy resource discounts by Moscow to feed their refineries.\n\nIn the Middle East and North Africa, where rising grain and oil prices have been most acutely felt, governments have by and large sought to refrain from taking sides. \"The region wanted to stay neutral, even American allies,\" Borshchevskaya said. This was most glaring in the decision of the oil cartel OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, to cut oil production, driving prices higher and blunting the impact of sanctions on Russias economy. \"You can also see that other American allies were simply too nervous or too afraid to anger Russia,\" she said.\n\nIn Africa, where Russia has sought to expand its reach in recent years, Moscows narrative that the war in Ukraine is a conflict between East and West has prevailed, said Joseph Siegle, director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. After being ousted from Europe in the wake of the war, Russias overseas state broadcaster, RT, announced plans to set up its first African bureau in South Africa.\n\nJust over half of the countries in Africa voted to condemn the invasion at the United Nations. For those that didnt, there is a spectrum of considerations at play. \"Theres the obvious reality that you have some regimes that are actively colluding with the Russians, like in the Central African Republic or Mali, and theyre highly indebted to and compromised by Russia,\" Siegle said, while others, from Uganda to Guinea, would likely welcome a greater Russian presence.\n\nAnd then there are the countries that see little gain in crossing one of the worlds more disruptive powers. \"From the perspective of many African leaders, they dont gain a lot from condemning Russia. But if they condemn Russia, there is a cost to that, and Russia has been clear that it will hold a grudge with those who vote against it,\" Siegle said.",

The cause of the explosion was a missile or missile parts that crossed into Poland, but the origin of the projectile remained unclear.\n\nMr. Biden told reporters in Bali, Indonesia, where he was attending a G20 summit, that it was \"unlikely\" the missile had been fired from Russia, based on its trajectory. But the president added that the investigation was ongoing, and \"we'll see.\"\n\nPolice officers stand at a blockade after an explosion in Przewodow, a village in eastern Poland near the border with Ukraine, November 16, 2022. KACPER PEMPEL/REUTERS\n\nHe called Russia's ongoing barrage of missile attacks on Ukraine, which surged on Tuesday, \"totally unconscionable,\" and noted that \"scores and scores\" of missiles had struck the country even as as leaders gathered for the G20 summit and urged deescalation in the nearly-nine-month war.\n\nThe Polish foreign ministry said earlier that the missile, which landed in the Polish village of Przewodw, was Russian-made, but President Andrzej Duda was cautious about its origin, saying officials did not know for sure who fired it or where it was made. He said it was \"most probably\" Russian-made, but that was still being verified. Both Russia and Ukraine have relied on stocks of Soviet-era Russian missiles during the war.\n\n\"We are acting with calm,\" Duda said. \"This is a difficult situation.\"\n\nThe meeting convened by Mr. Biden, early on Wednesday in Bali, included German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, EU President Ursula von der Leyen and EC President Charles Michel.\n\nPresident Joe Biden talks during a meeting of G7 and NATO leaders in Bali, Indonesia, November 16, 2022. Doug Mills/AP\n\nAfter the missile fell, Polish Foreign Affairs Minister Zbigniew Rau \"demanded immediate and detailed explanation\" from Russia, according to a statement by the Polish foreign ministry.\n\nPoland also noted that the incident took place as \"another hours-long, massive shelling took place of the entire territory of Ukraine and its critical infrastructure by the armed forces of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nHowever, the statement did not address the circumstances of the strike, including whether it could have been a targeting error or if the missile could have been knocked off course by Ukrainian defenses. A NATO statement called it a \"tragic incident.\" Earlier, a senior U.S. intelligence official had said that Russian missiles had crossed into Poland, but Poland's statement said it was one missile.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the government was investigating and raising its military preparedness level.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry denied responsibility for the incident, insisting that \"no strikes were made against targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border by Russian means of destruction.\"\n\nIn their statements, Poland and NATO used language that suggested they were not treating the explosion as a Russian attack, at least for now.\n\nIf Russia had deliberately targeted Poland, it would risk drawing the 30-nation NATO alliance into the conflict.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called an emergency meeting for Wednesday of the alliance's envoys to discuss the event, and Ukraine's Ambassador to the United Nations Sergiy Kyslytsya told CBS News that he expected the incident to be discussed at a previously scheduled U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Wednesday, too.\n\nPresident Biden was briefed on the incident and spoke by phone with Poland's Duda from Bali. According to a readout of the call, Mr. Biden offered the U.S.' full support and assistance with Poland's investigation, and he reaffirmed the U.S.' commitment to NATO. The two leaders agreed to remain in close touch as the investigation unfolds.\n\nThe National Security Council said in a statement that the U.S. was \"working with the Polish government to gather more information,\" and would \"determine what happened and what the appropriate next steps would be.\"\n\nRussia pounded Ukraine's energy facilities on Tuesday with its biggest barrage of missiles yet, striking targets across the country and causing widespread blackouts. A defiant Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy shook his fist and declared, \"We will survive everything.\"\n\nZelenskyy said Russia had fired at least 85 missiles, \"most of them at our energy infrastructure,\" and shut down power in many cities.\n\nThe aerial assault, which resulted in at least one death in a residential building in the capital, Kyiv, followed days of euphoria in Ukraine sparked by one of its biggest military successes the retaking last week of the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe power grid was already battered by previous attacks that destroyed an estimated 40% of the country's energy infrastructure.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has not commented on the retreat from Kherson since his troops pulled out in the face of a Ukrainian offensive. But the stunning scale of Tuesday's strikes spoke volumes and hinted at anger in the Kremlin.\n\nBy striking targets in the late afternoon, not long before dusk began to fall, the Russian military forced Ukrainian rescue workers to labor in the dark and gave repair crews scant time to assess the damage by daylight.\n\nMore than a dozen regions among them Lviv in the west, Kharkiv in the northeast and others in between reported strikes or efforts by their air defenses to shoot missiles down. At least a dozen regions reported power outages, affecting cities that together have millions of people. Almost half of the Kyiv region lost power, authorities said. Ukrainian Railways announced nationwide train delays.\n\nZelenskyy warned that more strikes were possible and urged people to stay safe and seek shelter.\n\nEleanor Watson, Ed O'Keefe, Camilla Schick and Pam Falk contributed to this report.",

Evgenia Novozhenina/Reuters\n\nA day after it emerged that the American basketball star Brittney Griner had been sent to a Russian penal colony, a top Russian diplomat said on Friday that the prospect of a prisoner exchange was increasing, and acknowledged that it could involve a Russian arms dealer imprisoned in the United States.\n\nBut U.S. officials dismissed the suggestion of any new optimism about an agreement, saying that the Kremlin had not been serious about negotiating a deal.\n\nSince June, the Biden administration has proposed trading Viktor Bout, the arms dealer, for Ms. Griner, who has been jailed for nine months, and Paul N. Whelan, an American held for almost four years and convicted of espionage, according to U.S. officials and numerous news media reports.\n\nTheir fates have been caught up in the hardening confrontation between Washington and Moscow over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which American officials say is reflected in the tough treatment of Ms. Griner. She has been jailed for nine months and was sentenced to nine years for entering Russia with vape cartridges containing hashish oil, and her lawyers confirmed on Thursday that she had been transferred to a penal colony, where harsh conditions and mistreatment are commonplace.\n\nU.S. officials have not publicly acknowledged that Mr. Bout has been offered in a prisoner swap, but on Friday, the Kremlin did. \"So far, we have not come to a common denominator, but it is undeniable that Viktor Bout is among those who are being discussed, and we certainly count on a positive result,\" Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister, told reporters in Moscow, according to the Interfax news agency,\n\nImage Female Penal Colony IK-2, where Ms. Griner serves her sentence, in Yavas, the Republic of Mordovia, Russia, on Friday. Credit... Reuters\n\nThe chance of an exchange \"is being strengthened,\" he said, adding that \"we are working professionally through a special channel designed for this.\" But he did not explicitly say for whom Mr. Bout would be traded, according to Interfax.\n\nThe U.S. State Department quickly threw cold water on his comments.\n\n\"We have made a substantial offer that the Russian Federation has consistently failed to negotiate in good faith,\" a department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said at a news briefing. The U.S. government \"has continued to follow up on that proposal and propose alternative potential ways forward.\"\n\nBut, he said, the Kremlins \"failure to seriously negotiate on these issues in the established channel, or any other channel for that matter, runs counter to its public statements.\"\n\nMr. Bout is currently serving a 25-year sentence in a U.S. prison for conspiring to sell weapons to people who said they planned to kill Americans. Since his arrest in 2008, Russia has repeatedly made efforts to secure his release.\n\nIn addition to Ms. Griners case, the Biden administration has been working to secure the release of Paul Whelan, a former Marine who in 2020 was sentenced to 16 years in a high-security Russian prison on espionage charges.\n\nThe release of Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine, as part of a prisoner exchange with Russia in April raised hopes that diplomatic efforts could still yield results despite the current level of hostility between Washington and Moscow.",

Polish radio public broadcaster [inaudible]. Secretary General what could be the outcome, concrete, in concrete terms of today's meeting? Can we expect enhancing the Europe's air defence; especially in the countries bordering Ukraine because as long as the war continues there will be Russian rockets striking Ukrainian citizen. There is a risk that such situation can happen again, thank you very much.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:\n\nIn the meeting today, NATO Allies expressed their strong support and solidarity with our Ally, Poland. They also expressed their deepest condolences for the tragic loss of life. And NATO has significantly increased its presence in the eastern part of the Alliance, in particular since the invasion of Ukraine in February. With more troops on land, ground troops, but also with significant substantial air and naval power. And this has of course, both increased our air defence capabilities, but also our capabilities to monitor, to have a full picture of what's going on, on the border between NATO Allies like Poland and Ukraine, and we are constantly assessing what more we need to do. We also have made important decisions at our Summit in Madrid to further strengthen our presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.\n\nNATO Spokesperson: BBC.\n\nBBC:\n\nThank you, Jessica Parker for BBC News. I just wanted to ask, given the incident that happened last night, do you think this was perhaps the most tense moment for NATO? In this conflict so far? Thank you.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nI'm always careful to rank different incidents and situations. It demonstrates that the war in Ukraine, which is President Putin's responsibility, continues to create dangerous situations. At the same time you have to remember that this happened at the same time as Russia launched a wave of new indiscriminate missile and air attacks on Ukrainian cities. Attacking critical civilian infrastructure, hitting civilian targets. Then it's nothing strange, then, of course, that is in itself a very dangerous situation. And then, that we then also see that there may be also consequences on NATO territory is a consequence of the war that Russia wages against Ukraine\n\nNATO Spokesperson: Then we go to the Ukrainian News Agency in the middle.\n\nUkrainian News Agency:\n\nThank you for the floor, [inaudible] national News Agency of Ukraine. I just want to mention that Ukrainians do understand the pain now of the Polish people and have the greatest sympathy with them. My question is how that incident will be reflected on the assistance that Allies provided for Ukraine in air defence. Where will be some kind of new systems to cover the Ukrainian sky? Thanks.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nThere will be a meeting today in the Contact Group for Ukraine to coordinate the support that NATO Allies and partners and others are providing to Ukraine. And the main focus of all our efforts over the last month has been on air defence. Especially since Russia started to launch these indiscriminate attacks on Ukrainian cities a few weeks ago. And I welcome that more and more Allies and partners are providing advanced air defence systems to Ukraine. NASAMS, HAWK batteries from Spain and others and I also know that Sweden has made the new announcement of additional support also with air defences to Ukraine. So we are mobilising additional support, especially when it comes to different types of air defences. NATO is also providing counter drones systems. We need many different systems to protect against cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, but also drones. We need a layered defence of Ukraine. That's exactly what Allies are providing in different ways.\n\nNATO Spokesperson: Bloomberg.\n\nBloomberg:\n\nDoes this incident, will this for more air defence for Allies on the eastern border, I mean you said, there has been a step up since beginning of the war, but does more need to be done? Thank you.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nWe're constantly assessing our presence in the eastern part of the Alliance. We have significantly increased our presence on land, at sea and in the air, and that has significantly increased our air defence capabilities, especially in the eastern part of the Alliance. At the same time, we have no indication that this incident was a result of a deliberate attack on NATO territory. And we have no indications that Russia is planning offensive military actions against NATO Allies. I think this demonstrates the dangers connected to the ongoing war in Ukraine. But it hasn't changed our fundamental assessment of the threat against that NATO Allies. It shows the importance of monitoring, of being vigilant, of the presence, and we made decisions for long term adaptation or NATO's deterrence and defence at the Summit in Madrid in June, and that includes partly more presence in the east, partly more pre-positioned equipment, in particular in the eastern part of the Alliance and partly earmarked forces, so we can quickly scale up the battle groups we have in the eastern part of the Alliance. And of course all of this will also further strengthen our air defence capabilities. Then air defence is partly land based but air defence is also very often air-based, also aircraft and naval-based, based on our ships, and of course, Air Forces and Naval Forces is something we very quickly move in. SACEUR, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe has already authorities to move in additional forces, including air and naval forces to augment our air defences quickly if needed.\n\nNATO Spokesperson: Frankfurter Allgemeine.\n\nFAZ:\n\nSecretary General, a few factual questions if I may. First of all, the debris found near the border of Poland and Ukraine. Is this debris only from an Ukrainian rocket launched to intercept Russian missile? Or is there also debris of a Russian missile? Secondly, what is what was the likely trajectory of the Russian missile that was meant to intercept by Ukraine? And thirdly, did NATO forces present at the eastern flank, activate their air defence systems yesterday? Because they saw an incoming, potentially incoming, missile? Thank you.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nWe have air defence systems in place, that are active 24/7, all the time. We have AWACS planes, we have aircraft, we have land based systems and we have naval-based systems. So we have air defences, which operate constantly throughout the Alliance. Then of course, we have a significant focus and in particular increased our presence in the eastern part of the Alliance and this also includes Poland. Then on the details of the findings and the ongoing investigation, it will not be right if I go into those details, but as I said, our preliminary findings are that this is likely caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile, and we have no indication that it wasn't a deliberate attack on NATO.\n\nNATO Spokesperson: Politico.\n\nThank you very much. Just a brief question. Has there been any communication between NATO and the Russian authorities, even on a technical level over the past 24 hours regarding Russian activity close to NATO's border? Thank you.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nWe have major lines of communication, so we're able to communicate with Russia in different ways as NATO and as Allies, but I cannot go into the details of exactly what kind of a contact there has been over the last 24 hours.\n\nNATO Spokesperson: Deutsche Welle.\n\nDeutsche Welle:\n\nI thank you. Does the fact that the Polish government, even after hours of assessing what had happened was still ready as of this morning, as I understand it, to possibly ask for Article 4 consultations. Does that indicate to you that they do not feel reassured despite all of these measures that have already been taken? And you said that you're constantly assessing and you've got things on tap. Are military planners making any additional plans at this very moment? To send more to Poland to reassure them? Because obviously this is a credible scenario since they had an article four teed up, even after investigations were underway. Thanks.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nSo I spoke to President Duda last night, we agreed on the importance of waiting the outcome of the investigation. We don't have the final outcome of the ongoing investigation, but all Allies agree on the assessment I just shared, That we have no indication that this was a deliberate attack and of course that has consequences for what kind of responses that we need to take. Since we have no indication of this was a deliberate attack or that Russia is planning any offensive military actions against NATO Allies. But we've also agreed that Russia bears the ultimate responsibility. They are responsible for the war in Ukraine that has caused this situation. And if it hadn't been for the war, of course, we wouldn't have been in this situation with the two casualties and the incident we saw in Poland yesterday, But Allies agree on the approach. There's been no call for an Article 4 meeting. That's based on the findings, based on the analysis and based on the results so far of the ongoing investigation.\n\nNATO Spokesperson: Ok, Spiegel.\n\nDer Spiegel:\n\nSecretary General, as you said that everything would be done to protect the allies. Now, the village where the missile hit yesterday was very close to the Ukrainian border. So in order to effectively protect Poland, from incidents like these in the future, would it not be conceivable or make sense from your point of view to extend the NATO air defense umbrella into Ukrainian territory in order to intercept missiles, which might be headed to potential targets near the Ukrainian-Poland border.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nNATO allies are not part to the conflict in Ukraine. NATO and NATO Allies provide support to Ukraine. We help Ukraine to uphold the rights for self defense. That is a right, which is enshrined in the UN Charter. And of course, Ukraine has the right to defend itself against Russia's illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. And our main priority now, or one of the top priority now is to provide more air defense systems for Ukraine. Our air defense systems are set up to defend against attacks around the clock. But we have no indication this was the result of a deliberate attack and this incident does not have the characteristics of an attack. And that also explains why the reactions were as they were last night because this was not a deliberate attack and didn't have the characteristics of a deliberate attack against NATO territory.\n\nNATO Spokesperson: ARD\n\nARD:\n\n[inaudible] Two questions if I may. The first one is a more personal one. Everybody was very scared. I think yesterday evening everybody understood that could be potentially a very dangerous situation. How was your personal reaction when you first heard about it? And the second one is about, you said that debris that was found is probably from a Ukrainian air defense missile. The Ukrainian foreign minister said this is a Russian conspiracy theory and it's not true. How do you judge that, that he made this judgement on the origin? Thank you.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nLast question?\n\nARD:\n\nKuleba said is it is the Russian conspiracy theory that it is Ukrainian air defense missile, but your preliminary findings are apparently very different. Thank you.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nWell, the investigations are not finally concluded. But based on what is so far now, this is most likely Ukrainian air defense systems or missiles. But again, this is not Ukraine's fault. Russia bears responsibility for what happened in Poland yesterday because this is a direct result of the ongoing war and the wave of attacks from Russia against Ukraine yesterday. And of course Ukraine has the right to shoot down those missiles that are targeting Ukrainian citizens and critical Ukrainian infrastructure. NATO is prepared for situations like this. We are exercising, we are preparing, for instance for accidents like this to first and foremost to prevent them from happening. But if they happen, to ensure that they don't spiral out of control. So yes, of course we were concerned when we got reports yesterday, and especially, we were saddened by the fact that there were two casualties but at the same time, we are monitoring we are following very closely. And therefore we are prepared to handle situations like this in a firm, calm, resolute way, but also in a way that prevent further escalation.\n\nNATO Spokesperson: Agence France-Presse\n\nAFP:\n\nThank you very much. Secretary General, you've said repeatedly that NATO has all the capabilities along the eastern front and that you're ready for these sorts of incidents at any moment. So what's this a failure of NATO's defenses that this missile was able to hit Polish territory?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nWell the air defense systems, they are set up to defend us against attacks and attack missiles, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, they have special characteristics, which we then follow up and we monitor and then we make a judgement whether it's an attack or whether it is something else. As I said this was most likely a Ukrainian air defense missile [inaudible] and of course, that missile doesn't have the characteristics of an attack. And therefore that explains also why the actions were as they were. And that doesn't say anything about our ability to defend against deliberate attacks against the NATO territory.\n\nNATO Spokesperson: Wall Street Journal\n\nWall Street Journal:\n\nDan Michaels, Wall Street Journal. Just a couple more factual questions, if possible, if the analysis yet shows this. Do you know if there was a Russian missile in the immediate area that the Ukrainians were specifically trying to target? And do you know, if the Ukrainian missile exploded on the ground, if it exploded potentially in the air and in contact with the Russian missile and if what was on the ground was just shrapnel or debris from that? Thank you very much.\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nAlthough there are relevant questions, I will not go into details, partly because there is an ongoing investigation. And, we had to decide later on how many details we can reveal. But anyway, there are ongoing investigations. So it's an ongoing investigation that will look into those issues.\n\nNATO Spokesperson: TV2, lady over there.\n\nTV2 Norway:\n\n[inaudible] from TV2 Norway. Mr. Secretary General, the France president, Emmanuel Macron, he urged China to play a greater mediation role during this conflict. Do you see a greater role for you for China? And second question, do you see any possibilities for peace negotiations in the near future?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nFirst and foremost, I believe that China should clearly condemn the invasion of Ukraine, which is a blatant violation of international law and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and, for instance, in the different votes in the UN, China has not voted in favor of those resolutions clearly condemning the invasion. Actually, China is also sharing much of the Russian narrative about the war and that's a narrative which is not correct. It is Russia and President Putin that are responsible for the war and they can also end the war. We have to remember this is this is a war of aggression, where one country, Russia, invades another country and tried to control and take territory from that country. And of course, Ukraine has right to defend itself against the invasion, against the Russian aggression. If President Zelensky and Ukrainians stop the fight, of course, then then then Russia will win and they will achieve their military goals. So the reality is that if President Putin and Russia stops fighting, then we will have peace. But if President Zelensky and Ukrainians stop fighting then Ukraine will cease to exist as an independent sovereign nation. They have the right to defend themselves as an independent nation. Most likely this war, whether that's on stage and at the negotiating table. At the same time, we know that the outcome of those negotiations is closely and fundamentally linked to the strength on the battlefield. So the best way we can ensure, maximize, the likelihood for a peaceful negotiated solution is to support Ukrainians on the battlefield, because that will maximize the probability for them achieving an acceptable negotiated solution on the negotiating table. So yes, we all want peace. We all want this war to end. That's the best way we can contribute to a peace which ensures that Ukraine remains a independent sovereign nation, is deployed the military support Ukraine, so there can be an acceptable negotiated solution at the end of this war.\n\nNATO Spokesperson: Ok one final question, TVN24 Poland.\n\nTVN24 Poland:\n\nThank you, Secretary General, as you said, it's too early to assess whether it was an accident or not. But for sure it was a stress test for the whole NATO. Could you assess that and the first reaction of the Polish government the channel of communications, and the reaction of the NATO. Any room for improvement and any lesson learned for future?\n\nNATO Secretary General:\n\nNATO allies and Poland reacted in a calm and measured and well-coordinated way. We coordinate our responses. So we, we spoke together of course, during the evening yesterday, and also our military commanders informed. I spoke with the Supreme Allied Commander, both yesterday and this morning. And he also came to NATO Allies to the North Atlantic Council here in the NATO Headquarters this morning and briefed the Allies. So the coordination, the exchange of information, and then measured responses and also the message that we need to establish the facts before we draw any final conclusions on the incident in Poland, that shows that NATO Allies reacted in a prudent and responsible way. I think we have to understand that to manage this kind of incidence is partly about being firm and reacting quickly. But it's also about being calm and preventing unnecessary escalation. And we always need to find that balance. Therefore it's also important to have the best possible picture of actually what happened. Therefore, we actually said yesterday that we need some time to look into the incident. We did that over the course of the night. And then we have a clearer picture today. A picture that also stated that we have no indication that this was a deliberate attack and no indication that this was something that was targeted on NATO territory, and no indication that Russia is planning any aggressive military actions but what we do know is that is that the whole incident is caused by Russia's brutal war in Ukraine. So the best way of preventing anything like this from happening again, is for Russia to stop this war.",

The broader implications include an increased risk of a nuclear emergency due to the plant's need for external power to maintain vital cooling processes, as well as the potential impact on other Ukrainian nuclear facilities facing similar threats (1,5).",
                "summary": "The shutdown of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe's largest nuclear station, has ceased electricity production, thus not contributing to Ukraine's power grid and instead requiring external power to maintain necessary cooling and safety systems (2). The plant's disconnection from the grid due to shelling has led to reliance on emergency diesel generators, which poses a significant risk to the nuclear safety and security situation in the region (1,3). This situation is further exacerbated by the plant being on the front line of the conflict, with military actions threatening the integrity of the plant and potentially increasing the likelihood of a nuclear emergency (4). The implications for Ukraine's national power supply are grave, as the ZNPP used to produce 15 percent of the country's electricity, and its disconnection illustrates the broader vulnerability of Ukraine's nuclear facilities during the ongoing war (1,4,5).",
                "more_detailed": "The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe's largest nuclear power station, has faced disconnections from the power grid due to shelling and military actions amid the ongoing conflict, causing significant concerns for Ukraine's national power supply (1,3,6). The plant, which once provided 15 percent of Ukraine's electricity, has been forced to shut down its reactors and switch to emergency diesel generators to maintain critical cooling and safety systems (1,2,3,6). This shift from being a power contributor to a power consumer places additional strain on Ukraine's already embattled energy infrastructure, which has experienced widespread disruptions from targeted strikes (1,3,6). Moreover, attempts by Russian forces to disconnect ZNPP from the Ukrainian grid and potentially redirect its power to Russia have further complicated the energy situation (4).\n\nThe implications of ZNPP's disconnection are twofold: there is an immediate impact on Ukraine's electricity supply, and there are heightened risks of a nuclear accident due to the instability of power required for the plant's safe operation (1,3,6,9). Restoration of external power is critical to avoid prolonged reliance on diesel generators, which are not a long-term solution for the plant's electrical needs (3,8). The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has underscored the precarious nuclear safety and security situation at ZNPP, with Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi calling for action to prevent a nuclear accident amidst the conflict (5,9). The IAEA's concern about the integrity of ZNPP and the increased risk to all of Ukraine's nuclear facilities illustrates the broader implications for both national safety and the environment (5,7,9,10)."

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest, now requires power from the grid for cooling and safety systems, which has been compromised due to targeted shelling, necessitating the use of emergency diesel generators (5).",

The targeted strikes have resulted in rolling blackouts across Ukraine, with approximately one-third of the country's power-generating capacity being taken out, as winter sets in (3). The nuclear reactors, although shut down, still require electricity to prevent the nuclear fuel from overheating, posing a risk if the power driving the cooling systems is cut (2). To mitigate these power supply issues, the EU and the UK are providing financial support for essential equipment like generators and power cables through the Ukraine Energy Support Fund (4).",

Attacks on energy infrastructure have resulted in rolling blackouts across Ukraine, with about a third of Ukraine's power-generating capacity taken out, particularly as winter sets in (3). The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe's largest nuclear station, along with other plants, has been forced to shut down reactors as a precautionary measure, switching to emergency diesel generators due to shelling that has cut off power lines, triggering concerns over nuclear safety (5,7,8).\n\nThese shutdowns require nuclear plants to draw power from the grid to maintain vital cooling and safety systems, and continued shelling has led to power outages that risk the overheating of nuclear fuel if cooling systems fail (2,5). The targeting of power lines by both Russian and Ukrainian forces has been disputed, but the result is the same: a precarious situation that threatens a nuclear catastrophe (6). International efforts, including assistance from the EU and the UK, have been directed at restoring power supplies through the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, but the situation remains critical as the ZNPP and other nuclear facilities operate on back-up power amidst ongoing military actions (4,8)."

However, \"widespread damage\" was still observed at the site, it said, which maintenance staff have already begun to repair. Grossi described the damage as \"a major cause of concern as it clearly demonstrates the sheer intensity of the attacks.\" Non-radioactive leaks were caused by damage to condensate storage tanks and the team observed \"several impacts on the main road along the plant's reactors as well as on a site railway that is now out of service,\" the IAEA statement said. The team also observed a \"pressurised air pipeline hit by shrapnel, two impacts on the roof of a special auxiliary building, minor visible damage to a sprinkler charging pipeline, as well as two impacts in a guardhouse area.\" No further attacks had taken place in the plant's vicinity overnight or throughout Monday so far, \"though there had been shelling in the area of the nearby city of Enerhodar and the industrial area,\" according to the IAEA team.",

The four additional plants are Rivne,Khmelnytskyi, South Ukraine, and Chornobyl. Since September, IAEA experts have been providing onsite support to Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest nuclear power plant, which is occupied by Russian forces. Following Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Ukraine's operational nuclear power plants of Zaporizhzhia, Rivne, South Ukraine, and Khmelnytskyi were disconnected from the grid and \"forced to rely on emergency diesel generators for the electricity they needed to ensure their continued safety and security,\" Grossi said. \"We must do everything to prevent a nuclear accident at any of these nuclear facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we are already witnessing in Ukraine. The time to act is now.\" Some context: Wednesday was the first time that Ukraine's four operationalnuclear power plantswere simultaneously shut down in 40 years, the head of state nuclear energy company Energoatom said in a statement. Petro Kotin said it was a precautionary measure and that he expected they would be reconnected by Thursday evening. The three fully functioning plants in Ukrainian hands would help supply electricity to the national grid, he said. Ukraine is heavily dependent on nuclear energy, according to the World Nuclear Association. It has 15 reactors at four plants that, before Russia's full-scale invasion in February, generated about half of its electricity. Russia has turned its attention to destroying energy infrastructure in Ukraine ahead of the bitter winter season, and successive waves of strikes have left much of the country facing rolling blackouts.",

Russia also retains control of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe\n\nThe occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, on 11 September Stringer/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nUkraines nuclear power stations have been caught, both politically and literally, in the crossfire ever since the start of Russias invasion. But this week, for the first time in history, all 15 of its nuclear reactors were taken offline by fighting.\n\nZaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), near the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar, is Europes largest nuclear power station and has been in Russian hands since in March. The final working reactor at ZNPP was shut down in September as a precautionary measure. Nuclear plants supply power to the grid when operating, but when shut down they actually draw power from it in order to run vital cooling and safety systems, which means disruption to electricity supply is a major concern.\n\nOn 23 November, shelling of power infrastructure in Ukraine by Russian troops led to blackouts that caused emergency diesel generators to start up at ZNPP, as well as at reactors across Ukraines three other nuclear plants that had previously made it through the war with relatively little disruption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement on its website, Ukrainian nuclear operator Energoatom said that for the first time in the 40-year history of the Ukrainian nuclear power industry, all of its nuclear power plants were not producing power, instead relying on diesel back-up generators. Access to the national grid resumed on 25 November.\n\nZNPPs six nuclear reactors, all fuelled by uranium-235, are a vital piece of infrastructure that Rosatom, Russias state nuclear energy company, has clung to since the early days of the invasion. Reports suggest that Rosatom is attempting to force Ukrainian staff at the plant to sign new contracts and join its own staff, which the majority are refusing. International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Mariano Grossi says this is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on staff.\n\nRecent rumours on social media suggest that ZNPP could be returned to Ukraine as part of concessions designed to prevent a major counteroffensive against Russian forces. Those rumours were lent at least some credence by the IAEAs claim this week that it was holding high-level consultations with Russia about implementing a \"nuclear safety & security protection zone\" around the ZNPP. Exactly what this would involve is unclear, and the IAEA didnt respond to a request for comment.\n\nJacopo Buongiorno at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says he is sceptical about the idea that Russia is going to return anything of value to Ukraine, but that if it did there would be long preparations needed before the plant could be restored to working condition.\n\n\"Restarting the plant would be a lengthy job. Think months, not weeks,\" he says. \"There are equipment and structures to repair, spare parts to acquire, staff to bring back and new staff to hire and train. A couple of reactors might be in good enough conditions to restart sooner, but for full capacity its likely months.\"\n\nHe says that four of ZNPPs reactors are on \"cold shut down\" and completely dormant, while two are being retained on \"hot shut down\", a kind of standby mode. Returning just those two to working order would take months, even if the war ended tomorrow and Energoatom resumed control. Buongiorno says that the plant is operating on \"shoestring\" staffing levels, and that vital spare parts wont have been delivered at the optimum rate.\n\nOlena Pareniuk, a scientist working at the Chernobyl site, says the process of restarting a nuclear power plant is long and difficult, but that the energy supply is sorely needed by Ukraines citizens, who are experiencing widespread blackouts across the country.\n\n\"It wont [come in time to] help us through winter,\" she says. Equipment will need to be checked, which is a job that cannot be rushed, she says. \"Energoatom says it will be fast, but nuclear-grade fast.\"\n\nBruno Merk at the University of Liverpool in the UK says Russia is \"doing currently everything to destroy the Ukrainian energy infrastructure\" and that even a retreating Russian occupation could cause problems on their way out, making it unusable without the support of Rosatom and its suppliers. \"They could destroy tiny essential components which can only be replaced by the manufacturer, and I cant see that the manufacturer would be willing to deliver this during war,\" he says.",

Bernat Armangue/Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine Hospital patients were being evacuated from Kherson as Russia stepped up its daily bombardment of the southern port city it retreated from two weeks ago.\n\nRussian forces shelled the city and surrounding area 49 times in the past 24 hours, killing at least 10 civilians and wounding dozens more, the head of the Kherson regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said on Friday morning.\n\nAttacks on residential neighborhoods are heaping new suffering on the people of Kherson and Thursday was one of the deadliest days since the Kremlin ordered its forces to retreat. Soon after Mr. Yanushevychs statement, further blasts were reported in the city, which remains without heat and electricity after departing Russian soldiers blew up much of the regions critical infrastructure.\n\n\"Due to constant Russian shelling, we are evacuating hospital patients from Kherson,\" Mr. Yanushevych said. Pediatric patients were transferred to Mykolaiv, he said, while 100 patients from the regional psychiatric care facility were moved to Odesa.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his nightly address late Thursday that Russia had begun shelling as \"revenge\" after Ukrainian troops reclaimed the city.\n\n\"Almost every hour, I receive reports of strikes\" in the Kherson region, Mr. Zelensky said. \"Such terror began immediately after the Russian Army was forced to flee from the Kherson region. This is the revenge of those who lost.\"\n\n\"Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian officials have encouraged people to leave for other parts of the country and have started running trains to and from the city to bring humanitarian relief.\n\nBut Serhii Khlan, the deputy regional administrator in Kherson, said many of the 80,000 who remain did not want to leave their homes despite the hardships.\n\n\"They say: We were living eight and a half months of occupation here, we survived,\" he said. \"Well survive, everything will get better. We will stay in our homes.\"\n\nSeveral more civilians, including a 13-year-old boy, were killed in blasts this week.\n\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, more than 6,557 civilians have died and about 10,000 people have been wounded, according to a report last week by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The true toll is thought to be significantly higher.\n\nMarch was the deadliest month of the war so far. But over the past month, as Russia has assumed defensive positions in the face of Ukrainian advances in the south and the northeast, Moscow has escalated its aerial bombardment of energy infrastructure targets in cities and towns across Ukraine.\n\nNatalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military southern command, said Ukrainian forces could now reach critical Russian supply lines running from Crimea into southern Ukraine with precision missiles.\n\n\"The Russian forces already understand the failure of their military strategy,\" she said, adding that they were building \"a multilayered defense\" on the eastern side of the river. The Russians have mined the coastlines, she said, and are setting up firing positions about 10 miles from the river, where they can target the city and surrounding region.",

                "cc_text": "The past year has seen an unsettling amount of new interest in nuclear weapons. While the likelihood of nuclear use is still generally agreed to be very low, it is significantly higher than it was this time last year. Russias invasion of Ukraine and Putins very unsubtle threats have raised speculation about how far he might be willing to go. Would he resume Russian nuclear tests? Or actually use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine? Those who did not live through the Cold War have probably never given much (or any!) thought to these kinds of questions. Even those who did have now spent decades in a post-Cold-War era, where the idea of intentional nuclear war between the US and Russia felt like a nightmare from the bad old days. The reemergence of such possibilities in the wake of Putins nuclear threats has created much alarmand an equal amount of confusionover what is happening, what could happen, and what it would mean.\n\nThe alarm is warranted; any time nuclear use of any kind is a realistic possibility you can be sure we have moved into a whole new, and incredibly dangerous, state of the world. The confusion is understandablefor most people there has been no need to think about these kinds of threats for decades and hearing the words \"nuclear\" and \"war\" in the same sentence is enough to inspire at least a small degree of panic. Understanding more about what the risks are and what they might mean is one way to begin to deal with this fear and transform it into an impetus for action and change that could help to avert the most dire scenarios.\n\nWhat types of nuclear risks do we face in Ukraine?\n\nOne place to begin sorting out this confusion is in clarifying the distinctions among different types of nuclear risk. Since the beginning of the Ukraine war, experts have discussed several different ways that nuclear weapons or technology might be involved in the conflict. The key ones here are (1) an incident at a Ukrainian nuclear power plant causedeither accidentally or deliberatelyby the conflict; (2) a \"dirty bomb\" attack; and (3) tactical nuclear weapons use.\n\nAttacks on nuclear power plants\n\nConcerns about how attackseither accidental or deliberatemight affect nuclear power plants in Ukraine arose shortly after the war began. Russian troops first occupied the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, located on Ukrainian territory and site of one of the worlds worst nuclear disasters in 1986. They also took control of Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after shelling set part of the complex on fire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of deliberately attacking the plant to cause \"nuclear terror.\" Due to ongoing shelling, the plant has periodically had to rely on backup diesel generators for power to keep its reactors cool and prevent a meltdown. Zaporizhzhia is one of four nuclear power plants currently operational in Ukraine.\n\nWhile many have argued that attacks on nuclear power plants are illegal under international humanitarian law, the reality is that this is not as clear cut as it should be. Moreover, such facilities could easily be damaged in the course of an active conflict even if they are not specifically targeted.\n\nThe consequences of an attack resulting in damage to a nuclear power plant are the closest to a \"known\" event, with multiple historical precedents. Major accidents at nuclear power plants such as the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (located within Ukrainian territory and occupied by Russia early in its invasion) or the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan, would be comparable to the damage that might result in a war. These disasters can result in the release of large amounts of radiation, rendering surrounding areas uninhabitable for many years and requiring extensive and very expensive cleanup efforts that can last decades. Around 200,000 people were evacuated at the time of the Chernobyl accident, and an area of 150,000 square kilometers (almost 58,000 square miles) was contaminated with radioactive material; cleanup of the site is still underway today.\n\nOne major difference between an attack on a nuclear power plant and other types of attacks is that the location is known in advance of any potential attack. In theory, a dirty bomb or nuclear bomb attack could happen anywhere, but the danger presented by an attack on a nuclear power plant is bound to a fixed location. Moreover, even outside of wartime, nuclear power plants develop plans to mitigate the effects of various kinds of incidents, including terrorist attacks. So there would likely be pre-existing plans for containment, evacuation, medical assistance to victims in surrounding areas, and other contingencies. Without a doubt, an attack during an active military conflict would make it considerably more difficultif not impossibleto carry out many of these plans as they were intended, but they might give at least a bit of a head start in preparation.\n\nDirty bombs\n\nMore recently, Russian statements have raised fears about possible use of a \"dirty bomb\" to spread radiation. The Russian statements expressed concern that Ukraine might use a dirty bomb itself but try to attribute it to Russia in a \"false-flag\" operation aimed at gaining international support and additional military assistance. But experts have noted that Russia has been known to float ideas accusing others of actions that it plans to take itself and that Russia could use claims that Ukraine had used a dirty bomb as a pretext to further escalate the war.\n\nSome have also suggested that Russia might try to use a very low-yield nuclear weapon and claim that the radiation it gave off was caused by a dirty bomb set off by Ukraine. However, as experts have pointed out, it would be relatively easy to tell the difference between these two types of bombs by both the type of radiation that results and also the blast effects from the initial explosion.\n\nA \"dirty bomb,\" known in more technical terms as a \"radiological weapon,\" or \"radiological dispersal device (RDD)\" is entirely different from a nuclear bomb. While a nuclear bomb relies on nuclear fission and fusion, a dirty bomb simply uses a conventional explosivelike dynamiteto disperse radioactive materials; there is no nuclear explosion.\n\nThis means that the damage done by a dirty bomb is mainly from the explosion, not the radiation. The radiological contamination from a dirty bomb would be spread much less widely than in a nuclear explosionthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission says \"within a few blocks or miles of the explosion,\" rather than the \"thousands of square miles\" that it could spread if a nuclear bomb were used. Damage and casualties would depend on the size of the explosion; deaths caused by radiation would be rare.\n\nA dirty bomb is intended to achieve different goals than a nuclear weapon. The goal of a dirty bomb is to disperse radioactive materials, harming those who are in the area and contaminating the site to render it unusable for some period of time, and sowing fear among the general public. Dirty bombs are generally weapons of terror, not of conquest. They have been called \"weapons of mass disruption,\" rather than \"weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nNone of this is to say that there would not be serious consequences in the event a dirty bomb was used. While the number of deaths and amount of destruction would be far less than with the use of a nuclear weapon, it would still be unprecedented. A dirty bomb used in a crowded area could kill or injure many people in its explosion, just like other terror attacks, such as the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. But, unlike an attack with a conventional bomb, radioactive contamination would complicate efforts to aid victims, evacuate the area, undertake a search for the perpetrators, and all the other activities that would normally follow such an incident. The cleanup efforts would be extensive and expensive, and if the attack occurred in an area where active military conflict was taking place, that would add another layer of difficulty.\n\nUse of a dirty bomb, especially for the first time, would also likely have major psychological consequences. This might be even more true in Ukraine, with its historical memory of nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. But the impact would be felt worldwide, as the unprecedented use of such a weapon of terror would create widespread fear and likely demands for a military response.\n\nPolitically, if it became clear that Russia was behind the use of a dirty bomb, this would further isolate Russia from the international community.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons\n\nOne of the first threats that came up in media reports and expert commentary following the Russian invasionspurred by dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric from Russian President Vladimir Putinwas the possibility that Russia might use a tactical nuclear weapon to dissuade the US and NATO from further aiding Ukraine. If such a weapon were used, even in symbolic fashion with few casualties, it would break a taboo against the use of nuclear weapons that has not been broken since the US dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. There is no guarantee that it would not start an escalatory spiral culminating in all-out nuclear war.\n\nAlthough they are often thought of as \"small,\" the most important thing to know about tactical nuclear weapons is that they are still full-fledged nuclear weapons. The modifiers \"tactical\" or \"strategic\" indicate how these weapons would likely be used, but both operate in the same way, and have the same effects, to greater or lesser degrees.\n\nModern nuclear weapons work by using conventional explosives to compress nuclear material, causing nuclear fission (this is called the \"primary\"). This fission releases massive amounts of energy, creating the extremely high temperature and pressure needed to ignite nuclear fusion (the \"secondary\"). The energy released by these weapons creates a fireball that reaches temperatures of tens of millions of degreesthe same range as the center of the sun.\n\nCharacterizing tactical nuclear weapons as \"small\" is misleadingsome so-called \"tactical\" nuclear weapons have yields as great or greater than that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 (15 kilotons) that killed more than 70,000 people instantly and reduced the city to ruins.\n\nThe idea that using a tactical nuclear weapon would be anything other than a catastrophe is inaccurate and unspeakably dangerous. First, even one nuclear explosion could spread radiological contamination over a wide area if weather conditions, such as high winds, allow it.\n\nBut even if Russia were to detonate a single low-yield nuclear weapon in an uninhabited area with the intention of simply sending a message; even if there were very fewor even nocasualties and fallout was negligible, this would still constitute a fundamental shift in the entire international security system. It would violate a central normthat of nuclear non-useand, in the worst case, could set off a series of escalatory moves that could spin out of control into a full-fledged nuclear war, with civilization-ending consequences.\n\nEven an attack not large enough to cause widespread environmental damage would still create varying levels of uncertainty and panic worldwide. In the immediate area of the attack, chaos would ensue as medical workers and first responders struggled to aid victims and deal with the aftermath of the explosion in a radioactive environment. It is unlikely that sufficient medical help would be available, particularly of the specialized kind that would be in greatest demand (such as burn beds). The most well-resourced cities during peacetime would struggle to meet such needs; the situation would be far worse during an active conflict. Farther afield, people would flee large cities that they imagined might be future targets. Global economic and financial networks would be disrupted.\n\nUnderstanding and averting risks\n\nWhile it is undeniably alarming to think of any nuclear involvement in wartime, understanding the differences among possible scenarios can help to understand how we can prevent the worst from happening. In some cases, there are immediate practical steps that could be taken. For example, to avoid a nuclear power plant accident, combatants could create \"safe zones\" around nuclear power plants as the International Atomic Energy Agency has recommended.\n\nUndoubtedly, use of a tactical nuclear weapon is the scenario with the potential for the most far-reaching consequences. While no one can control Putins actions, we must work now to ensure that if he does carry out his irresponsible threats, the US and its allies do not act in a way that leads down the path to nuclear war. Most crucially, the United States and NATO must not respond with nuclear weapons. As my colleague Stephen Young has pointed out, \"the only fight with Russia that the United States will lose is a nuclear conflict.\" That goes for the rest of the world as well.",

Bogusaw Wos, 62, the foreman of a grain warehouse, and Bogdan Ciupek, 60, a tractor driver, were killed around 3.40pm Tuesday when an S-300 rocket hit the town of Przewodow in eastern Poland, near the border with Ukraine. Warehouse supervisor Bogusaw Wos, 62 (left), and tractor driver Bogdan Ciupek, 60 (right), have been named as the two men killed in a missile strike on Poland yesterday afternoon Horrified residents reported hearing 'strange whistles' as the missile flew overhead and then 'a massive explosion, about a thousand decibels' as it slammed down. Neighbours say Boguslaw had worked in the grain silo warehouse for 40 years and lived with his wife and elderly mother-in-law, who they both looked after. The Przewodow native is reported to have two grown up children who now live in the southern Polish city of Krakow. Bogdan, who worked as a driver at the grain drying plant, lived in the nearby village of Setniki. A neighbour told local media: 'We all know each other, it's not a big town. 'We have never experienced such a tragedy. They were good people.' Another told news portal interia.pl: 'Boguslaw went to work as usual and at around 4pm his wife realized that something bad had happened. 'Some of the neighbors, out of compassion and curiosity, wanted to visit his wife but she was in a frenzy, she did not want to talk, she looked into the distance and cried. 'She was in terrible shock.' It is thought that Bogdan had just arrived at a grain-drying warehouse driving a tractor-trailer full of grain when the missile hit. Boguslaw was reportedly waiting for him, to help unload the cargo. Advertisement\n\nToday, Polish President Andrzej Duda, speaking after a meeting of his security council Wednesday, said he has seen 'no evidence' the missile was fired by Russia and it was in fact 'highly probable' the Soviet-era S-300 rocket came from Ukraine. There is no indication that Poland was deliberately targeted, he added.\n\n'Ukraine's defense was launching their missiles in various directions and it is highly probable that one of these missiles unfortunately fell on Polish territory,' according to Duda, who added that Russia bears ultimate responsibility for the strike because Putin began the war in Ukraine.\n\nJens Stoltenberg, head of NATO, backed that analysis - saying the strike was likely a Ukrainian missile, there is 'no indication' it was deliberate and there is 'no indication' Russia is preparing an attack on NATO. However, he added: 'This is not Ukraine's fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine.'\n\nLudivine Dedonder, the Belgian defence minister, said preliminary investigations by his security forces indicate the same thing - adding to reports that emerged in the early hours suggesting Biden had also told NATO leaders the rocket was from Ukraine.\n\nHours after the incident, Volodymyr Zelensky had blamed it on 'Russian missile terror', and Kyiv is yet to concede its own missile was involved. Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, said Kyiv wanted access to the site and still saw a Russian 'trace' behind the attack.\n\nThe news came after a nervous night in which it looked like NATO and Russia could be heading for a direct confrontation that would have risked triggering World War Three, and it underlines the risk that a single mistake or miscalculation in Ukraine could yet spark such a conflict.\n\nMateusz Morawiecki, the Polish Prime Minister, said it may no longer be necessary to trigger NATO Article 4 - which calls for discussions among allies over a threat - but that allies will strengthen air defences in the region.\n\nHowever, that will come as small comfort to the families of the two men killed, who were identified by Polish media as a tractor driver called Bogdan C and a warehouse foreman called Boguslaw W, both aged in their 60s.\n\nLocals said the pair were working to offload grain at a drying facility when the missile hit, killing them instantly.\n\nThe blast happened around 900ft from a housing compound where around 500 people live. If the missile had struck it, casualties would have been much higher.\n\nHorrified residents reported hearing 'strange whistles' as the missile flew overhead and then 'a massive explosion, about a thousand decibels.'\n\nNeighbours say that Boguslaw who had worked in the grain silo warehouse for 40 years lived with his wife and elderly mother-in-law, who they both looked after. He is reported to have two grown up children who live in Krakow.\n\nBogdan C., who worked as a driver for the plant, lived in the nearby village of Setniki.

'She was in terrible shock.'\n\nZelensky, addressing the G20 for a second time Wednesday, said the strike on Poland was 'a true statement brought by Russia for the G20 summit.'\n\n'There is a terrorist state among you, and we are defending ourselves against it. That is the reality,' he added, though Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov had already departed the conference late Tuesday.\n\nMr Sunak, speaking as the G20 broke up with a joint statement condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine, said allies are still working to 'establish the facts' of what happened in Poland.\n\nHe added: 'The persistent threat to our security and global asphyxiation has been driven by the actions of the one man unwilling to be at this summit - Vladimir Putin.\n\n'There isn't a single person in the world who has not felt the impact of Putin's war.'\n\n'What we agreed this morning is that it is important to establish the facts and this is exactly what is happening as we speak. We will get to the bottom of what happened.\n\n'[The strike] was happening at a time when the G20 was gathered trying to find resolution to some of the world's challenges. I think it shows utter contempt for the international rules-based system.'\n\nThe dramatic development came on another day of bloodshed and destruction in Ukraine, with more than 100 Russian missiles landing in major population centres, killing three and cutting the power supply to millions.\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke by phone Tuesday with Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda, offering his condolences following reports of the alleged Russian missile strike on Polish soil.\n\n'Expressed condolences over the death of Polish citizens from Russian missile terror. We exchanged available information and are clarifying all the facts. Ukraine, Poland, all of Europe and the world must be fully protected from terrorist Russia,' Zelensky said in a tweet.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Twitter: 'Spoke with President Duda about the explosion in Poland. I offered my condolences for the loss of life. NATO is monitoring the situation and Allies are closely consulting.

The 4am attack 'blew up an oil depot in the settlement of Stalnoi Kon', said regional governor Andrey Klychkov. Unverified images on social media showed what appeared to be a single rupture on the side of an oil storage tank, blackened by soot. The logo of Russia's state-controlled pipeline operator Transneft can be seen on the tank, which state television said was believed to be empty. The alleged drone attack left a crater some 12ft deep, according to one report. Since the start of Russia's offensive in Ukraine, several fuel or ammunition depots in southern Russia have been attacked by drones or helicopters, with authorities blaming Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian official Anton Geraschenko drew attention to the depot blast without claiming responsibility. He posted an image of the site in flames - which it was not possible to verify - and a caption: 'Smoking in the wrong place reached the Oryol region.' Pictures later showed significant damage to the oil storage complex. The site is around 100 miles from the border with Ukraine. If it was Ukrainian, it would be a record reach for a Kyiv attack on Russia. Images show a suspected Ukrainian military drone attack on a Russian oil depot just 190 miles from Moscow The 4am attack 'blew up an oil depot in the settlement of Stalnoi Kon', said regional governor governor Andrey Klychkov Advertisement\n\nThe bombardment left half of Kyiv, where at least one civilian died, and the whole city of Zhytomyr without power.\n\nStrikes were also reported in the western city of Lviv - the closest large urban settlement to the Polish border - and caused partial blackouts.\n\nKharkiv, Vinnytsia, Rivne, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Chernihiv, Khmelnytskyi, and Ivano-Frankivsk were also targeted.\n\nThe bombardment came as German newspaper Der Spiegel reported that documents leaked from the German military said one of the country's top generals, Eberhard Zorn, ordered the country's army to put itself on a war footing in the face of 'existential' threats.\n\nThe 68-page policy paper was produced in September, according to Der Spiegel. In it, Zorn called for the complete overhaul of the German military and told commanders to prepare themselves for war.\n\n'Attacks on Germany can potentially occur without warning and with great, possibly even existential, damage,' he wrote.\n\nAttacks on Ukraine came just hours after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky - speaking via videolink from Kyiv - told world leaders at the G20 Bali summit that he is ready to end the war provided Russia withdraws its troops from areas it currently occupies.\n\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov - speaking later at the summit in Indonesia - accused the West of waging 'hybrid war' in Ukraine and Kyiv of 'prolonging' the conflict, without mentioning Russia's own involvement in the fighting.\n\n'There is an attack on the capital. According to preliminary information, two residential buildings were hit in the Pechersk district,' Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.\n\n'Several missiles were shot down over Kyiv by air defence systems. Medics and rescuers are at the scene of the strikes.'\n\nMoments later, he added: 'Another hit in the Pechersk district. Multi-storey building.'\n\nAndriy Yermak, head of Zelensky's staff, said the attack was a response to the president addressing the G20 - ramping up pressure on Russia to stop its attacks.\n\n'Does anyone seriously think that the Kremlin really wants peace? It wants obedience. But at the end of the day, terrorists always lose,' Yermak said.\n\nRussian forces have in recent weeks been targeting energy infrastructure across Ukraine and has launched barrages of missiles and swarms of drones.\n\nAround a third of Ukraine's power-generating capacity has been taken out, causing rolling blackouts across the country just as winter hits.\n\nKyiv was last targeted by Russian forces nearly one month ago on October 17.\n\nRussia faced mounting diplomatic pressure Tuesday to end its war in Ukraine, as G20 allies and critics alike rued the painful global impact of nearly nine months of conflict.\n\nA draft communique obtained by AFP showed the world's 20 leading economies coming together to condemn the war's effects, but still divided on apportioning blame.\n\nThe summit has shown that even Russia's allies have limited patience with a conflict that has inflated food and energy prices worldwide and raised the spectre of nuclear war.\n\nRisking diplomatic isolation, Russia was forced to agree that the war in Ukraine - which Moscow refuses to call a war - has 'adversely impacted the global economy'.\n\nMateusz Zub, 30, holds his mouth in shock as he reacts to the news that two people died in a missile hit on his home town\n\nMembers of the Polish police searching the countryside around where the missiles hit walk past a sign for the local town, Przewodow, where two men were killed\n\nPolish police man a checkpoint along the road to a village where the missile exploded on Tuesday afternoon, local time\n\nPolice officers walk near the site of an explosion in Przewodow, a village in eastern Poland near the border with Ukraine\n\nAt least three Russian missiles hit the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv on Tuesday, with mayor Vitali Klitschko saying they all struck residential buildings\n\nIt also agreed that 'the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons' is 'inadmissible', after months of its president Vladimir Putin making such threats.\n\nThe embattled Russian leader has skipped the summit, staying at home to reckon with a string of embarrassing battlefield defeats and a grinding campaign that threatens the future of his regime.\n\nRubbing salt in Russia's wounds, Zelensky - fresh from a visit to liberated Kherson - delivered an impassioned video appeal to G20 leaders.\n\nHe said they could 'save thousands of lives' by pressing for a Russian withdrawal.\n\nThe United States and its allies used the summit to broaden the coalition against Russia's invasion and scotch Moscow's claims of a conflict of East versus West.\n\nWestern officials offered a sobering assessment of the conflict yesterday, indicating their belief the conflict could 'grind on' through 2023. They consider the war to have reached a stalemate.",

                "cc_text": "Bali, Indonesia, 15-16 November 2022\n\n1. Fourteen years ago, the Leaders of the G20 met for the first time, facing the most severe financial crisis in our generation. We recognized, as large global economies, that collectively we carry responsibilities and that our cooperation was necessary to global economic recovery, to tackle global challenges, and lay a foundation for strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth. We designated the G20 the premier forum for global economic cooperation, and today we reaffirm our commitment to cooperate as we, once again, address serious global economic challenges.\n\n2. We met in Bali on 15-16 November 2022, at a time of unparalleled multidimensional crises. We have experienced the devastation brought by the Covid-19 pandemic, and other challenges including climate change, which has caused economic downturn, increased poverty, slowed global recovery, and hindered the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n3. This year, we have also witnessed the war in Ukraine further adversely impact the global economy. There was a discussion on the issue. We reiterated our national positions as expressed in other fora, including the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly, which, in Resolution No. ES-11/1 dated 2 March 2022, as adopted by majority vote (141 votes for, 5 against, 35 abstentions, 12 absent) deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine. Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy constraining growth, increasing inflation, disrupting supply chains, heightening energy and food insecurity, and elevating financial stability risks. There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions. Recognizing that the G20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, we acknowledge that security issues can have significant consequences for the global economy.\n\n4. It is essential to uphold international law and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability. This includes defending all the Purposes and Principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and adhering to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians and infrastructure in armed conflicts. The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Todays era must not be of war.\n\n5. At todays critical moment for the global economy, it is essential that the G20 undertakes tangible, precise, swift and necessary actions, using all available policy tools, to address common challenges, including through international macro policy cooperation and concrete collaborations. In doing so, we remain committed to support developing countries, particularly the least developed and small island developing states, in responding to these global challenges and achieving the SDGs. In line with the Indonesian G20 Presidency theme Recover Together, Recover Stronger we will take coordinated actions to advance an agenda for a strong, inclusive and resilient global recovery and sustainable development that delivers jobs and growth. With the above in mind, we will:\n\nStay agile and flexible in our macro-economic policy responses and cooperation. We will make public investments and structural reforms, promote private investments, and strengthen multilateral trade and resilience of global supply chains, to support long-term growth, sustainable and inclusive, green and just transitions. We will ensure long-term fiscal sustainability, with our central banks committed to achieving price stability.\n\nProtect macroeconomic and financial stability and remain committed to using all available tools to mitigate downside risks, noting the steps taken since the Global Financial Crisis to strengthen financial resilience and promote sustainable finance and capital flows.\n\nTake action to promote food and energy security and support stability of markets, providing temporary and targeted support to cushion the impact of price increases, strengthening dialogue between producers and consumers, and increasing trade and investments for long-term food and energy security needs, resilient and sustainable food, fertilizer and energy systems.\n\nUnlock further investments for low- and middle-income and other developing countries, through a greater variety of innovative financing sources and instruments, including to catalyze private investment, to support the achievement of the SDGs. We ask the Multilateral Development Banks to bring forward actions to mobilize and provide additional financing within their mandates, to support achievement of the SDGs including through sustainable development and infrastructure investments, and responding to global challenges.\n\nRecommit to accelerate achievement of the SDGs, achieving prosperity for all through sustainable development.\n\n6. We are deeply concerned by the challenges to global food security exacerbated by current conflicts and tensions. We therefore commit to taking urgent actions to save lives, prevent hunger and malnutrition, particularly to address the vulnerabilities of developing countries, and call for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems and supply chains. We commit to protect the most vulnerable from hunger by using all available tools to address the global food crisis. We will take further coordinated actions to address food security challenges including price surges and shortage of food commodities and fertilizers globally. Recalling the G20 efforts such as the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, we welcome global, regional, and national initiatives in support of food security, and in particular note the progress made by the UN Secretary Generals Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, as well as the World Bank Groups and IMFs food security responses. We emphasize the importance of building on the G20 Matera Declaration, working together to sustainably produce and distribute food, ensure that food systems better contribute to adaptation and mitigation to climate change, and halting and reversing biodiversity loss, diversify food sources, promote nutritious food for all, strengthen global, regional, and local food value chains, and accelerate efforts to reduce food loss and waste. We will also implement the One Health approach, intensify research on food science and technology, and improve stakeholders capacity along the food supply chains, particularly women, youth, smallholder, and marginal farmers as well as fishers.\n\n7. We support the international efforts to keep food supply chains functioning under challenging circumstances. We are committed to addressing food insecurity by ensuring accessibility, affordability, and sustainability of food and food products for those in needs, particularly in developing countries and least developed countries. We reiterate our support for open, transparent, inclusive, predictable, and non-discriminatory, rules-based agricultural trade based on WTO rules. We highlight the importance of enhancing market predictability, minimizing distortions, increasing business confidence, and allowing agriculture and food trade to flow smoothly. We reaffirm the need to update global agricultural food trade rules and to facilitate trade in agricultural and food products, as well as the importance of not imposing export prohibitions or restrictions on food and fertilizers in a manner inconsistent with relevant WTO provisions. We are committed to sustained supply, in part based on local food sources, as well as diversified production of food and fertilizers to support the most vulnerable from the disruptions in food trade supply chain. We will avoid adversely impacting food security deliberately. We commit to facilitate humanitarian supplies for ensuring access to food in emergency situations and call on UN Member States and all relevant stakeholders with available resources to provide in-kind donations and resources to support countries most affected by the food crisis, as required and based on assessed needs by governments of affected countries. We continue to support the carve out of humanitarian activities from sanctions and call on all nations to support this aim, including through current efforts at the UN. We will continue to closely monitor the state of global food security and nutrition.\n\n8. We welcome the Trkiye and UN-brokered two Istanbul Agreements signed on 22 July 2022 and consisting of the Initiative on the Safe Transportation of Grain and Foodstuffs from Ukrainian Ports (Black Sea Grain Initiative) and the Memorandum of Understanding between the Russian Federation and the Secretariat of the United Nations on Promoting Russian Food Products and Fertilizers to the World Markets, on the unimpeded deliveries of grain, foodstuffs, and fertilizers/inputs from Ukraine and the Russian Federation, to ease tension and prevent global food insecurity and hunger in developing countries. We emphasize the importance of their full, timely and continued implementation by all relevant stakeholders, as well as the UN Secretary-Generals calls for continuation of these efforts by the Parties. In this context we highlight other efforts that ensure the flow of agri-food goods such as the EU Solidarity Lanes and the Russian donations of fertilizers facilitated by the World Food Programme. Moreover, we take note of various initiatives addressing food insecurity such as the Arab Coordination Group initiative.\n\n9. We are committed to supporting the adoption of innovative practices and technologies, including digital innovation in agriculture and food systems to enhance productivity and sustainability in harmony with nature and promote farmers and fishers livelihoods and increase income, in particular smallholders by increasing efficiency, and equal access to food supply chains. We will promote responsible investments in agricultural research and science and evidence-based approaches. We will continue to strengthen the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) as an early warning tool, to enhance food and fertilizer/inputs market transparency, reduce market uncertainties, and support coordinated policy responses for food security and nutrition, through the sharing of reliable and timely data and information.\n\n10. We ask the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Bank Group (WBG) to share with us the results of their mapping exercises on food insecurity, which will be consolidated in the future with inputs from technical experts and other relevant international organizations, and will provide a systemic analysis of responses to address food security. This will identify any major gaps in global responses; examine food and nutrition variables and funding; examine the supply and demand of fertilizers; build on the G20 Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS); and identify any medium-term issues that require further technical and systemic analysis. The FAO and WBG will report back by the 2023 Spring Meetings.\n\n11. We meet at a time of climate and energy crises, compounded by geopolitical challenges. We are experiencing volatility in energy prices and markets and shortage/disruptions to energy supply. We underline the urgency to rapidly transform and diversify energy systems, advance energy security and resilience and markets stability, by accelerating and ensuring clean, sustainable, just, affordable, and inclusive energy transitions and flow of sustainable investments. We stress the importance of ensuring that global energy demand is matched by affordable energy supplies. We reiterate our commitment to achieve global net zero greenhouse gas emissions/carbon neutrality by or around mid-century, while taking into account the latest scientific developments and different national circumstances. We call for continued support for developing countries, especially in the most vulnerable countries, in terms of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy, capacity building, affordable latest technology within the public domain, mutually beneficial technology cooperation and financing mitigation actions in the energy sector.\n\n12. We reaffirm our commitment to achieve SDG 7 targets and strive to close the gaps in energy access and to eradicate energy poverty. Recognising our leadership role, and guided by the Bali Compact and the Bali Energy Transition Roadmap, we are committed to finding solutions to achieve energy markets stability, transparency, and affordability. We will accelerate transitions and achieve our climate objectives by strengthening energy supply chain and energy security, and diversifying energy mixes and systems. We will rapidly scale up the deployment of zero and low emission power generation, including renewable energy resources, and measures to enhance energy efficiency, abatement technologies as well as removal technologies, taking into account national circumstances. We recognise the importance to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation, including renewable energy, as well as energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power, in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards just transitions. We will increase our efforts to implement the commitment made in 2009 in Pittsburgh to phase-out and rationalize, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and commit to achieve this objective, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable. We will strengthen international cooperation as well as relevant producer-consumer dialogues on securing energy affordability and accessibility by limiting volatility in energy prices and scaling up clean, safe, inclusive, and sustainable technologies, including developing regional energy interconnectivity. We are committed to promote investment in sustainable infrastructure and industry, as well as innovative technologies and a wide range of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms to support clean energy transitions, including, as appropriate, the use of carbon pricing and non-pricing mechanisms and incentives, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable.\n\n13. Mindful of our leadership role, we reaffirm our steadfast commitments, in pursuit of the objective of UNFCCC, to tackle climate change by strengthening the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and its temperature goal, reflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in light of different national circumstances. We will play our part fully in implementing the Glasgow Climate Pact and the relevant outcomes of previous COPs and CMAs, in particular COP 26, including the call to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in our NDCs, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement. In this regard, we welcome enhanced climate actions resulting from the new or updated NDCs and invite parties to urgently scale up mitigation and adaptation ambition and means of implementation as well as make progress on loss and damage at COP 27 which is being held in Africa. Noting the IPCC assessments that the impact of climate change will be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5C compared with 2C, we resolve to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. This will require meaningful and effective actions and commitment by all countries, taking into account different approaches, through the development of clear national pathways that align long-term ambition with short and medium-term goals, and with international cooperation and support, including finance and technology, and sustainable and responsible consumption and production as critical enablers, in the context of sustainable development.\n\n14. We welcome the progress to date towards achieving a Post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). We urge all parties and countries to finalize and adopt the GBF with the view of realizing of 2050 Vision of \"Living in harmony with Nature\" at the second part of COP15 CBD as a strong framework of action and accountability for halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030 and, as appropriate, to update National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans accordingly. We emphasize the importance of achieving and synergizing the objectives of the three Rio Conventions. We stress the need for clear and measurable goals and targets for biodiversity and means of implementation and accountability. We commit to strengthen actions to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and call on CBD Parties to adopt an ambitious, balanced, practical, effective, robust and transformative post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework at COP-15 in Montreal. We urge for increased resource mobilization from all sources, including from countries and entities, to provide new and additional financial resources for the implementation of the GBF, once it is negotiated, including to help enable and support developing country parties, and for aligning private and public financial flows with biodiversity objectives. We will scale up efforts to combat biodiversity loss, deforestation, desertification, land degradation and drought, as well as restoring degraded land to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030, and in support of the G20s ambition to reduce land degradation by 50% by 2040 on a voluntary basis. We recognize the effort made by a number of countries to ensure that at least 30% of global land and at least 30% of the global ocean and seas are conserved or protected by 2030 and we will help to make progress towards this objective in accordance with national circumstances. We commit to reduce environmental impacts by changing unsustainable consumption and production patterns as well as to enhance environmentally sound waste management including by preventing illegal cross-border traffic of waste.\n\n15. We will step up efforts to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, including through Nature-based Solutions and Ecosystem-based Approaches, support climate mitigation and adaptation, enhance environmental conservation and protection, sustainable use and restoration, responding to natural disasters, reduce ecosystem degradation, enhance ecosystem services and to address issues affecting the marine and coastal environment. We will further promote sustainable development and lifestyles, resource efficiency and circular economy to increase sustainability and work together on scientific knowledge-sharing, raising awareness, and capacity building, particularly to advance on the ocean-based climate action. We are committed to ending illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We welcome the WTO multilateral Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies and encourage its rapid entry into force. In line with the UNEA Resolution 5/14, we are committed to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, with the ambition of completing the work by the end of 2024. We highlight the progress made and call on participating delegations to achieve an ambitious and balanced agreement without delay on an international legally binding instrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, as called for in the UNGA Resolution 69/292. We also acknowledge that ecosystems, including forests, seagrasses, coral reefs, wetland ecosystems in all their diversity, including peatlands and mangrove, support climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.\n\n16. We acknowledge the urgent need to strengthen policies and mobilize financing, from all sources in a predictable, adequate and timely manner to address climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation including significantly increasing support for developing countries. We recall and further urge developed countries to fulfil their commitments to deliver on the goal of jointly mobilizing USD 100 billion per year urgently by 2020 and through to 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation. We also support continued deliberations on an ambitious new collective quantified goal of climate finance from a floor of USD 100 billion per year to support developing countries, that helps in fulfilling the objective of the UNFCCC and implementation of the Paris Agreement. We emphasize the importance of transparency in the implementation of the pledges. We also recall the Glasgow Climate Pact urging developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries, from 2019 levels, by 2025, in the context of achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation in the provision of scaled up financial resource, recalling Article 9 of the Paris Agreement.\n\n17. In the context of strengthening global efforts to reach the objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as implementing the COP26 commitments, we reiterate that our policy mix toward carbon neutrality and net zero should include a full range of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms including, as appropriate, the use of carbon pricing and non-pricing mechanisms and incentives, and phase out and rationalize, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and commit to achieve this objective, while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable, and in line with national circumstances. We acknowledge the macro-economic risks stemming from climate change and will continue discussions on the costs and benefits of different transitions.\n\n18. We are committed to take actions in support of orderly, just and affordable transitions to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in line with the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement as well as with the convention on Biological Diversity. We welcome the progress made across the G20, international organizations, other international networks and initiatives, and the private sector in addressing the priorities of the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap, which is voluntary and flexible in nature, and call for further efforts to advance the Roadmaps recommended actions that will scale up sustainability financing. We welcome the establishment of the Sustainable Finance Working Groups online dashboard and repository of relevant work, to illustrate ongoing and future progress made on the Roadmap, and encourage members to contribute on a voluntary basis, taking country circumstances into consideration. We endorse the 2022 G20 Sustainable Finance Report which articulates practical and voluntary recommendations for jurisdictions and relevant stakeholders in developing transition finance frameworks, improving the credibility of financial institutions net zero commitments and scaling up sustainable finance instruments, with a focus on improving accessibility and affordability. We also welcome the valuable discussion during the Presidencys Forum on policy levers that incentivize financing and investment to support the transition.\n\n19. We remain committed to promoting a healthy and sustainable recovery which builds towards achieving and sustaining Universal Health Coverage under the SDGs. While the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared monkeypox as another Public Health Emergency International Concern (PHEIC), reinforcing that international health threats are ever present and that the G20 and broader global community must come together to improve our collective prevention, preparedness and response capabilities. We reaffirm the importance of strengthening of national health systems by putting people at the center of preparedness and equip them to respond effectively. We emphasize the need for equitable access to pandemic medical countermeasures, and welcome the efforts of ACT-A, and note that the results of the ACT-A external evaluations can be useful lessons for future discussions. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthen global health governance, with the leading and coordination role of WHO and support from other international organizations. We support the work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) that will draft and negotiate a legally binding instrument that should contain both legally binding and non-legally binding elements to strengthen pandemic PPR and the working group on the International Health Regulations that will consider amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) mindful that the decision will be made by World Health Assembly.\n\n20. The G20 High Level Independent Panel, as well as the WHO and World Bank have estimated there is an annual pandemic PPR financing gap of approximately USD 10 billion. As initiated by the Saudi Arabian G20 Presidency, the Italian G20 Presidency and continued by the Indonesian G20 Presidency, we welcome the provision of additional financial resources, to assist in financing critical gaps in implementing IHR (2005) and increase PPR capacities. In this regard, we welcome the establishment of a new Financial Intermediary Fund for Pandemic PPR (the Pandemic Fund) hosted by the World Bank. It aims to address critical pandemic PPR gaps and build capacity at national, regional and global levels, bring additionality in financial resources for pandemic PPR, catalyze complementary investments, and facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to pandemic PPR strengthening. We welcome the Pandemic Funds inclusive membership and representation from low- and middle-income countries, civil society organizations and donors, and acknowledge the WHOs technical expertise and central coordination role in this endeavor, which reflects its leadership role in the global health architecture. We appreciate the work of the Secretariat hosted by the World Bank, with the WHO as technical lead and as chair of the Technical Advisory Panel. We look forward to the launch of the Pandemic Funds first call for proposals as soon as possible. We commit to increase the capacity of developing countries for pandemic PPR through the Pandemic Fund, and look forward to the stocktaking review of the Pandemic Fund at the end of its first year to draw on lessons learned and incorporate any changes needed to ensure it is operating in accordance with its governing documents and effective at filling critical PPR gaps, and that it continues to have a central coordination role for the WHO, maintains a strong connection to the G20, and is inclusive of the perspectives of low- and middle-income countries and additional non-G20 partners in its decision making. We commend the pledges by current donors, amounting to over USD 1.4 billion, and encourage additional voluntary pledges. We call on new donors to join the Pandemic Fund, as they are able to.\n\n21. It is essential to continue collaboration between Finance and Health Ministries for pandemic PPR. We extend the mandate of the Task Force, and ask the Secretariat of the Task Force to work with the Task Force co-chairs, the incoming Indian G20 Presidency, the G20 Troika, and G20 members to agree on a Task Force workplan for 2023, taking into account a multi-year planning horizon. We thank the WHO for continuing to host the Secretariat, with support from the World Bank. In 2023 the Task Force will continue to be co-chaired by Indonesia and Italy, representing advanced and emerging economy perspectives, and will continue to draw on expertise of the WHO, International Financial Institutions and other relevant organizations, with the support of the 2023 Indian G20 Presidency. To expand the voice of lower income countries we invite key regional organizations to join the Task Force meetings, as appropriate. We will work closely with the WHO to ensure the Task Force continues to complement the global pandemic PPR architecture and there is no further duplication and fragmentation of the global health governance system. Delivering on the mandate from the G20 Rome Leaders Declaration, in 2023 the Task Force will continue developing coordination arrangements between Finance and Health Ministries, and share best practices and experiences from past finance-health coordination in order to develop joint responses to pandemics, as appropriate. The Task Force will undertake work to better understand economic risks and vulnerabilities from pandemics, and how to mitigate them, with a focus on finance and health coordination in response to new pandemics, considering country-specific circumstances and recognizing the importance of further work on resource mobilization. We ask the Task Force to report back to Finance and Health Ministers in 2023 on its progress.\n\n22. We recognize that the extensive COVID-19 immunization is a global public good and we will advance our effort to ensure timely, equitable and universal access to safe, affordable, quality and effective vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics (VTDs). Acknowledging the adoption of the Ministerial Declaration on the WTO Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Preparedness for Future Pandemics and the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement at the WTOs 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12), we note that, no later than six months from the date of the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement, WTO members will decide on its extension to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics. We remain committed to embedding a multisectoral One Health approach and enhancing global surveillance, including genomic surveillance, in order to detect pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that may threaten human health. To enable global pathogen surveillance as part of our commitment to implement the IHR (2005), we encourage sharing of pathogen data in a timely manner on shared and trusted platforms in collaboration with WHO. We encourage sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of pathogens consistent with applicable national laws.\n\n23. We recognize the need for strengthening local and regional health product manufacturing capacities and cooperation as well as sustainable global and regional research and development networks to facilitate better access to VTDs globally, especially in developing countries, and underscore the importance of public-private partnership, and technology transfer and knowledge sharing on voluntary and mutually agreed terms. We support the WHO mRNA Vaccine Technology Transfer hub as well as all as the spokes in all regions of the world with the objective of sharing technology and technical know-how on voluntary and mutually agreed terms. We welcome joint research and joint production of vaccines, including enhanced cooperation among developing countries. We acknowledge the importance of shared technical standards and verification methods, under the framework of the IHR (2005), to facilitate seamless international travel, interoperability, and recognizing digital solutions and non-digital solutions, including proof of vaccinations. We support continued international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted global digital health networks as part of the efforts to strengthen prevention and response to future pandemics, that should capitalize and build on the success of the existing standards and digital COVID-19 certificates.\n\n24. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the transformation of the digital ecosystem and digital economy. We recognize the importance of digital transformation in reaching the SDGs. We acknowledge that affordable and high-quality digital connectivity is essential for digital inclusion and digital transformation, while a resilient, safe and secure online environment is necessary to enhance confidence and trust in the digital economy. We recognize the importance of policies to create an enabling, inclusive, open, fair and non-discriminatory digital economy that fosters the application of new technologies, allows businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive, and protects and empowers consumers, while addressing the challenges, related to digital divides, privacy, data protection, intellectual property rights, and online safety. We acknowledge the importance to counter disinformation campaigns, cyber threats, online abuse, and ensuring security in connectivity infrastructure. We remain committed to further enable data free flow with trust and promote cross-border data flows. We will advance a more inclusive, human-centric, empowering, and sustainable digital transformation. We also reaffirm the role of data for development, economic growth and social well-being.\n\n25. We encourage international collaboration to further develop digital skills and digital literacy to harness the positive impacts of digital transformation, especially for women, girls, and people in vulnerable situations, and further support efforts to develop reliable skills and literacy. We note the increasing demands for a workforce adept at utilizing emerging technologies, education and training, reskilling and upskilling to meet such demands. We also seek to increase connectivity by accelerating high capacity and secure infrastructure and provide more accessible and affordable resources and tools, while also improve the digital literacy skills of learners, teachers, school leaders, and other educational professional to ensure universal access to education, accelerate learning recovery and promote lifelong learning.\n\n26. We found digital technology becomes the key for recovery and empowerment across various sectors, including in building a resilient and sustainable food system and agriculture, creating sustainable and decent jobs and human capacity development, supporting inclusive trade, industrialization and investment, increasing productivity, as well as opening up the potential of the future economy, especially for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and start-ups. It is essential to ensure that no one is left behind in our effort to digitally transform our society, by involving all stakeholders, including the youth, women, business sector, audit institution, parliaments, scientists, and labours.\n\n27. We support continued implementation of the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments, including the future delivery of the initial estimates for key performance indicators and 2022 Progress Report that sets out priorities for the next stage of work. We encourage central banks, other public authorities and the payments industry to continue to work collaboratively on these important initiatives to enhance cross-border payments. We welcome the report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) on interlinking payment systems and the role of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that was presented in a joint workshop by the Indonesian G20 Presidency in coordination with the BIS CPMI and the BIS Innovation Hub (BISIH) on cross-border payments and interoperability at the Festival Ekonomi Keuangan Digital Indonesia (FEKDI) 2022. We also welcome the joint report by the BIS CPMI, BISIH, IMF, and World Bank on options for access to and interoperability of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) for cross-border payments.\n\n28. We endorse the G20 Financial Inclusion Framework on Harnessing Digitalization to Increase Productivity and Foster a Sustainable and Inclusive Economy for Women, Youth and MSMEs or Yogyakarta Financial Inclusion Framework guided by the G20 2020 Financial Inclusion Action Plan. To address digitalization and sustainable finance developments, and support financial inclusion and well-being, we endorse the updated G20/OECD High-Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection and welcome the updated G20/OECD High-Level Principles on SME Financing.\n\n29. To support our collective ambition to recover together, recover stronger, we commit to well-calibrated, well-planned, and well-communicated policies to support sustainable recovery, with due consideration to country-specific circumstances. We commit to mitigate scarring effects to support strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. We will stay agile and flexible in our fiscal policy response, standing ready to adjust to the changing circumstances as needed. Temporary and targeted measures to help sustain the purchasing power of the most vulnerable and cushion the impact of commodity price increases, including energy and food prices, should be well designed to avoid adding to high inflationary pressures. We will continue to enhance macro policy cooperation, preserve financial stability and long-term fiscal sustainability, and safeguard against downside risks and negative spillovers. Macroprudential policies need to remain vigilant to guard against rising systemic risks as financial conditions tighten. Recognizing that many currencies have moved significantly this year with increased volatility, we reaffirm the commitments made on exchange rates by our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in April 2021. We also reiterate the importance of global cooperation and express our appreciation to the Indonesian G20 Presidency for its efforts to maintain an effective system of multilateralism through the G20.\n\n30. G20 central banks are strongly committed to achieving price stability, in line with their respective mandates. To that end, they are closely monitoring the impact of price pressures on inflation expectations and will continue to appropriately calibrate the pace of monetary policy tightening in a data-dependent and clearly communicated manner, ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored, while being mindful to safeguard the recovery and limit cross-country spillovers. Central bank independence is crucial to achieving these goals and buttressing monetary policy credibility.\n\n31. We are committed to the swift implementation of the OECD/G20 two-pillar international tax package. We welcome the progress on Pillar One. We also welcome progress on Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Model Rules, which pave the way for consistent implementation at a global level as a common approach, and we look forward to the completion of the GloBE Implementation Framework. We call on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) to finalize Pillar One, including remaining issues and by signing the Multilateral Convention in the first half of 2023, and to complete the negotiations of the Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) under Pillar Two that would allow the development of a Multilateral Instrument for its implementation. We will work to strengthen the tax and development agenda in light of the July 2022 G20 Ministerial Symposium on Tax and Development, and we note the G20/OECD Roadmap on Developing Countries and International Tax. We support the progress made on implementing internationally agreed tax transparency standards, including regional efforts and welcome the signing of the Asia Initiative Bali Declaration in July 2022. We also welcome the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework and the amendments to the Common Reporting Standard, both of which we consider to be integral additions to the global standards for automatic exchange of information. We call on the OECD to conclude the work on implementation packages, including possible timelines, and invite the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes to build on its commitment and monitoring processes to ensure widespread implementation of both packages by relevant jurisdictions.\n\n32. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the long-term financial resilience of the international financial architecture, including by promoting sustainable capital flows, and developing local currency capital markets. We welcome the IMFs revised Institutional View on Liberalization and Management of Capital Flows and look forward to continued discussions with international organizations on the coherent implementation of international frameworks for the use of capital flow management measures, while being mindful of their original purpose. We look forward to further progress by the IMF in operationalizing the Integrated Policy Framework and welcome the report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on Macro-financial stability frameworks. We welcome continued exploration of how CBDCs could potentially be designed to facilitate cross-border payments, while preserving the stability and integrity of the international monetary and financial system. We welcome the successful completion of the G20 TechSprint 2022, a joint initiative with the BISIH, which has contributed to the debate on the most practical and feasible solutions to implement CBDCs. We reiterate our commitment to maintaining a strong and effective Global Financial Safety Net with a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at its center. We remain committed to revisiting the adequacy of quotas and will continue the process of IMF governance reform under the 16th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula as a guide, by 15 December 2023. We take note on the continuation of discussion of the IMF surcharge policy.\n\n33. 1 We are committed to support all vulnerable countries to recover together, recover stronger. We welcome pledges amounting to USD 81.6 billion through the voluntary channelling of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or equivalent contributions, and call for further pledges from all willing and able countries to meet the total global ambition of USD 100 billion of voluntary contributions for countries most in need. We welcome the operationalization of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) to help eligible low-income countries, small states and vulnerable middle-income countries address longer-term structural challenges that pose macroeconomic risks, including those stemming from pandemics and climate change. We welcome the voluntary contributions to the RST and call for additional pledges and timely contributions to it and to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), especially for subsidy resources, to ensure a broad pool of contributors to meet funding needs. We are open to explore viable options for countries to voluntarily channel SDRs through Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), while respecting national legal frameworks and the need to preserve the reserve assets status of SDRs. We will explore ways, including through balance sheet optimization measures, and other potential avenues, to maximize MDBs development impact. We welcome early deliberations and urge MDBs to continue to discuss options for implementing the recommendations of the G20 Independent Review of MDBs Capital Adequacy Frameworks within their own governance frameworks, and to deliver an update in Spring 2023. This will inform the ongoing development of a roadmap for the implementation of the recommendations, while safeguarding MDBs long-term financial sustainability, robust credit ratings and preferred creditor status. We acknowledge the concluding report on the 2020 Shareholding Review of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and look forward to the 2025 Shareholding Review. At this challenging juncture, we reiterate our commitment to step up our efforts to implement the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in a predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner. We welcome progress in this regard, including the provision of financing assurances for Zambia. We welcome the conclusion of the debt treatment to Chad and encourage the timely conclusion of the debt treatment for Zambia by early 2023. We also encourage the conclusion of the debt treatment for Ethiopia under an IMF-supported program. We are concerned about the deteriorating debt situation in some vulnerable middle income countries. This could be addressed by multilateral coordination that involves all official and private bilateral creditors to take swift action to respond to their requests for debt treatments. We stress the importance for private creditors and other official bilateral creditors to commit to providing debt treatments on terms at least as favourable to ensure fair burden sharing in line with the comparability of treatment principle. We reaffirm the importance of joint efforts by all actors, including private creditors, to continue working toward enhancing debt transparency. We welcome the efforts of private sector lenders who have already contributed data to the joint Institute of International Finance (IIF)/OECD Data Repository Portal, and continue to encourage others to also contribute on a voluntary basis.\n\n34. In the face of a more challenging global economic and financial outlook, we underline the need to reinforce global financial system resilience and ask the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and IMF to continue their monitoring efforts. We commit to sustaining global financial stability, including through continued coordination of policy measures and implementation of international standards. We welcome the FSBs final report on financial sector exit strategies and scarring effects of COVID-19 and its conclusions regarding financial stability issues by the end of 2022. We strongly support global policy actions to increase resilience, in particular against cross-border spillovers, including by addressing the identified structural vulnerabilities in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) from a systemic perspective. To this end, we welcome the FSBs NBFI progress report with policy proposals to address systemic risk in NBFI, including in open-ended funds. We welcome the report by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on the review of margining practices. We support taking forward the implementation of the FSB updated Roadmap for addressing climate-related financial risks which complements the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap. Globally consistent data are needed in order to effectively address climate-related financial risks. We look forward to the finalization of standards by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) in support of globally consistent, comparable and reliable climate-related financial disclosures, and its work beyond climate, and we welcome the efforts to achieve interoperability across disclosure frameworks. We welcome the FSB progress report on achieving consistent and comparable climate-related financial disclosures and the final report on supervisory and regulatory approaches to climate-related risks. We welcome the report by the FSB and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) on climate-scenario analysis by jurisdictions.\n\n35. We welcome ongoing work by the FSB and international standard setters to ensure that the crypto-assets ecosystem, including so-called stablecoins, is closely monitored and subject to robust regulation, supervision, and oversight to mitigate potential risks to financial stability. We welcome the FSBs proposed approach for establishing a comprehensive international framework for the regulation of crypto-asset activities based on the principle of same activity, same risk, same regulation. We welcome the FSB consultative report on the review of its high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of \"global stablecoin\" arrangements. We also welcome the FSB consultation report on promoting international consistency of regulatory and supervisory approaches to crypto-assets activities and markets. It is critical to build public awareness of risks, to strengthen regulatory outcomes and to support a level playing field, while harnessing the benefits of innovation. We welcome the final guidance by the BIS CPMI and IOSCO which confirms that the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures apply to systematically important stablecoin arrangements. We welcome the FSB consultative report on achieving greater convergence in cyber incidents reporting, and look forward to the final report. We welcome the results of the second phase of the Data Gaps Initiative (DGI-2) and will continue to work with partners in addressing the identified remaining challenges. We welcome the workplan on the new Data Gaps Initiative (DGI) prepared by the IMF, FSB and the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics (IAG) in collaboration with participating members. We ask the IMF, the FSB and the IAG to begin work on filling these data gaps and report back on progress in the second half of 2023, noting that the targets are ambitious and delivery will need to take into account national statistical capacities, priorities, and country circumstances as well as avoiding overlap and duplication at international level. We welcome the progress of work on the review of the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, including the second report and the ongoing public consultation, and look forward to further updates on the review.\n\n36. We reaffirm that the rules-based, non-discriminatory, free, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, sustainable and transparent multilateral trading system (MTS), with the WTO at its core, is indispensable to advancing our shared objectives of inclusive growth, innovation, job creation and sustainable development in an open and interconnected world as well as to supporting the resilience and recovery of a global economy under strain due to COVID-19 and global supply chain disruption. We agree that reforming the WTO is key in strengthening trust in the MTS. We will continue to ensure a level playing field and fair competition to foster a favourable trade and investment environment for all. We note the importance of the contribution of the MTS to promote the UN 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. Commending the successful conclusion of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12), we commit to seize and advance the positive momentum by engaging in active, constructive, pragmatic, and focused discussions on WTO reform to improve all its functions, including reform of the dispute settlement mechanism, on the path leading to the MC13.\n\n37. We are committed to reinforce international trade and investment cooperation to address supply chain issues and avoid trade disruptions. We believe that trade and climate/environmental policies should be mutually supportive and WTO consistent and contribute to the objectives of sustainable development. We also recognise the importance of inclusive international cooperation on digital trade. We recognize the need to promote value addition through sustainable and inclusive investment in highly productive sectors such as downstream manufacturing, digital trade, and services, and to foster linkages between foreign investors and local enterprises particularly MSMEs. We note the initiative from the Indonesian Presidency to hold discussions on policy coherence between trade, investment and industry, and to continue addressing industry-related issues in the broader G20 process, as appropriate.\n\n38. We recognize the importance of revitalizing infrastructure investment in a sustainable, inclusive, accessible, and affordable way. We endorse the voluntary and non-binding G20/GI Hub Framework on How to Best Leverage Private Sector Participation to Scale Up Sustainable Infrastructure Investment which will consider country circumstances, and which will complement investment from other sources, including public investment and finance provided by MDBs. We note the Outcome Document from the 2022 G20 Infrastructure Investors Dialogue. To enhance social inclusion and address subnational disparities, we endorse the G20-OECD Policy Toolkit on Mobilizing Funding and Financing for Inclusive and Quality Infrastructure Investment in Regions and Cities, prepared with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). We note the Preliminary Findings Report on Gender Inclusive Approaches in Private Participation in Infrastructure in promoting gender considerations during the infrastructure lifecycle and look forward to the final report. We endorse the InfraTracker 2.0 which will enable both the public and private sectors towards transformative infrastructure investment post-COVID-19, by providing insights into long-term infrastructure strategies and plans. To narrow the digital divide, we endorse the G20 Compendium of Case Studies on Digital Infrastructure Finance: Issues, Practices and Innovations. We endorse the Quality Infrastructure Investment (QII) Indicators and associated guidance note, developed for the G20, which are voluntary and non-binding and consider country circumstances, and we look forward to further discussions on how the QII indicators can be applied. We welcome progress made towards developing a possible new governance model for the Global Infrastructure Hub (GI Hub) and ask that principles to guide the process be finalized as soon as possible.\n\n39. The rise of automation and digital technologies are reshaping the world of work, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Adding to the situation, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities in many countries and continues to disproportionately affect women, youth, older workers, persons with disabilities and migrant workers. We underline that it remains our utmost priority to mitigate the adverse impact of the current trends on the labour market, reduce inequalities while responding effectively to the opportunities that automation and digital technologies present and promote gender equality. We remain committed to the promotion of decent work and the elimination of child and forced labour.\n\n40. We reaffirm our commitment to support the full inclusion of migrants, including migrant workers, refugees, in our recovery efforts, in the spirit of international cooperation and in line with national policies, legislation, and circumstances, ensuring full respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms regardless of their migration status. We also recognize the importance of preventing irregular migration flows and the smuggling of migrants, as part of a comprehensive approach for safe, orderly and regular migration, while responding to humanitarian needs and the root causes of displacement. We support strengthening cooperation between countries of origin, transit, and destination. We will continue the dialogue on migration and forced displacement in future Presidencies.\n\n41. We remain committed to a human-centred, inclusive, fair, sustainable approach that leads to greater social justice, decent work, and social protection for all. We will continue our work to integrate persons with disabilities, women, and youth across sectors and levels in pursuit of an inclusive labour market. We are resolved to promote sustainable development of human capacity, labour markets, and productivity, including through community-based vocational education and training, to advance job creation through entrepreneurship, to empower MSMEs, and to accelerate our efforts to foster and adapt labour protection for all workers, including those in the informal sector. We will maximize our approach to skills development to respond effectively to the needs of the labour market, with the involvement of social partners. We will accelerate progress towards the Antalya Youth Goal, as well as universal social protection for all by 2030.\n\n42. We are deeply concerned that multidimensional crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lack of fiscal space and unequal access to finance and technology, are posing significant challenges towards realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in a timely manner. We will demonstrate leadership and take collective actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and accelerate the achievement of the SDGs by 2030 and address developmental challenges by reinvigorating a more inclusive multilateralism and reform aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda.\n\n43. In this regard, we will strengthen inclusive and sustainable recovery and build resilience in all developing countries, including SIDS in the Pacific and Caribbean and LDCs, through ambitious and concrete actions. We also reiterate our continued support to Africa, including through the G20 Compact with Africa and the G20 Initiative on Supporting Industrialization in Africa and LDCs. We will focus on MSMEs, adaptive social protection, green economy and blue economy. We recognise the need for partnership to promote mutually beneficial technology cooperation and share good practice, as well as the need for inclusive and quality infrastructure investment for stronger recovery and resilience. We underscore the need to address the financing gap towards implementation of the 2030 Agenda, through enhancing innovative financing mechanisms, including blended finance, while noting the importance of transparency and mutual accountability. We take note of initiatives such as the Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure and the Global Blended Finance Alliance, and welcome the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction. We look forward to the success of the SDGs Summit in 2023.\n\n44. Access to education is a human right and a pivotal tool for inclusive and sustainable economic recovery. We welcome the outcome of the Transforming Education Summit. We will act in solidarity in particular with developing countries to rebuild more resilient, tech-enabled, accessible, and effective education systems. We will empower relevant actors within and beyond G20 to remove barriers to education, improve teaching and learning environments, and support transitions within and across all stages of education, with emphasis on women and girls. We also underscore the importance of learners well-being in their preparation for work and meaningful participation and contribution to more equitable, inclusive and sustainable society. We reaffirm the importance of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and our commitment to SDG4 to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and training. We are committed to promoting lifelong learning at all levels amidst the changing nature of work and encourage partnership in this regard.\n\n45. We acknowledge the importance of research and innovation in sustainable resource utilization in various sectors, especially in the midst of health, climate, food and energy crises. We welcome research and innovation collaboration for the conservation of biodiversity and its use to support the sustainable development including green and blue economy. We also promote inclusive collaborations to further research and innovation, as well as promoting researchers international mobility.\n\n46. As women and girls continue to be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises, we reaffirm our commitment to put gender equality and womens empowerment at the core of our efforts for an inclusive recovery and sustainable development. We commit to implement the G20 Roadmap Towards and Beyond the Brisbane Goal foster financial inclusion and access to digital technologies, including to address the unequal distribution in paid and unpaid care and domestic work, with a focus on closing the gender pay gap. We commit to the elimination of gender-based violence, the enhancement of social, health, care and educational services, and the overcoming of gender stereotypes. We will continue to advance womens and girls equal access to inclusive and quality education, including participations in STEM education, women entrepreneurship through MSMEs, and womens and girls access in leadership positions. We will promote quality of life for women in rural areas and women with disabilities. We welcome the work that has been done by the EMPOWER Alliance and its engagement with the G20, and support the future convening of G20 Ministerial Conference on Womens Empowerment.\n\n47. We reaffirm the important role of tourism for global recovery, and the community-based approach for rebuilding a more human-centred, inclusive, sustainable, and resilient tourism sector. We acknowledge the vital importance of strengthening safe international mobility and connectivity and seamless post-Covid travel to enable tourism recovery. We further recognize that creative economy, which involve knowledge-based economy, human creativity, and intellectual property rights, contributes to improving the resiliency of tourism local communities and MSMEs through human capital development, digital transformation, innovation, public-private partnerships, sustainable preservation of natural and cultural heritage, and innovative financing while retaining their significant commercial and cultural values.\n\n48. We reaffirm the role of culture as an enabler and driver for sustainable development with intrinsic value beyond its social and economic benefits. We are committed to develop policies that draw on cultural diversity as a resource for sustainable living and promote an inclusive and equitable ecosystem at all levels that values the contribution of those working in the culture, arts and heritage sectors. We will respect, protect and preserve the cultural heritage of our peoples, including local communities and indigenous peoples, as applicable. We support public incentives and sustainable investments from the private sector to strengthen the cultural economy. We will safeguard cultural heritage as well as fighting illicit trafficking of cultural property and promoting restitution to its rightful owner/countries of origin, in accordance with the relevant UNESCO Conventions and national laws.\n\n49. We will continue to lead by example through strengthening and implementing our obligations and commitments to anti-corruption efforts including through legally binding instruments, while renewing our commitment to zero tolerance for corruption. We emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability for both public and private sector as a crucial part of a collective recovery effort. We underscore the important role of auditing as well as public participation and anti-corruption education in preventing and tackling any form of corruption. We recall our commitments and call on all countries to criminalise bribery, including bribery of foreign public officials, and effectively prevent, combat, detect, investigate, prosecute and sanction bribery. We will further work to strengthen international cooperation and legal frameworks to combat economic crimes including corruption related to organized crime and money laundering, including, on a voluntary basis, through existing networks and initiatives such as GlobE and the G20 Denial of Entry Experts Network. We will share information on our actions towards criminalising foreign bribery and enforcing foreign bribery legislation in line with Article 16 of UNCAC, and look forward to enlarging participation to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, as appropriate. We reaffirm our commitment to deny safe haven to corruption offenders and their assets, in accordance to domestic laws. We also recognize the importance of mitigating corruption risk in all sectors. We will further strengthen our engagement with and promote active participation by stakeholders such as academia, civil society, media and the private sector, including to advance a culture of integrity.\n\n50. We recognize the need for the international community to step up their efforts to effectively combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing. We reaffirm our commitment to delivering the strategic priorities of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its FATF Style Regional Bodies (FSRBs) to lead global action to respond to these threats. We welcome the initiative by the FATF to promote implementation of international standards on virtual assets, in particular the \"travel rule\", and transparency of beneficial ownership, and acknowledge their role in the fight against systemic corruption and environmental crimes, which gravely impact economies and societies. We support the ongoing work of the FATF to enhance global efforts to seize criminal proceeds and return funds to victims and states in line with domestic frameworks. We encourage all G20 members to strengthen collaboration to adopt and effectively implement the FATF standards.\n\n51. We welcome the Indonesian Presidencys efforts to compile a wide array of national submissions and international coordinated collaborations from G20 members, invited countries, and regional and international organizations. These have been presented in the \"G20 Action for Strong and Inclusive Recovery\", as annexed. We call for further concrete actions to impart greater momentum and impact to the efforts of international community to recover together and recover stronger.\n\n52. We welcome the outcomes of various G20 working groups and Ministerial meetings. We appreciate and thank Indonesia for its Presidency and for successfully hosting the Bali G20 Leaders Summit and for its contribution to the G20 process. We look forward to meeting again in India in 2023, in Brazil in 2024 and in South Africa in 2025.\n\nWe thank international organizations, including the UN and its Specialised Agencies, World Bank Group, IMF, OECD, Asian Development Bank, ERIA, CEPI, European Investment Bank, GGGI, ICAO, IEA, IEF, IFAD, ILO, IRENA, FAO, FSB, Gavi, Global Fund, IAEA, Islamic Development Bank, ITU, Medicine Patent Pool, Sustainable Energy for All (SEforAll), OPEC, WEF, WFP, WHO, WTO, UNCCD, UNCTAD, UNDESA, UNDP, UNECE, UNESCAP, UNESCO, UNFCCC, UN Global Pulse, UN Habitat, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNOPS, UN Women, UNWTO and the G20 Engagement Groups (W20, L20, T20, S20, Y20, SAI20, P20, C20, B20, U20) for their valuable inputs and policy recommendations.\n\n1 Noting that one member has divergent views on debt issues in paragraph 33, and emphasized the importance of debt treatment by multilateral creditors like MDBs.\n\n###",

During the day, if the power system is ready these stations will be connected to the power grid\". Ukraine separately informed the IAEA that the three plants had been relying on diesel generators for back-up electricity while in shutdown mode.\n\nDirector General Grossi noted that Ukraines nuclear industry yesterday had experienced the most extensive loss of off-site power since the conflict began nine months ago, saying this further underlined the need for stepped-up action to protect the plants and prevent the danger of a serious nuclear accident.\n\n\"The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraines nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is become increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous. It is the first time that all the plants suffer a loss of external power at the same time. This would have been completely unimaginable before this tragic war. It is extremely concerning. All military action threatening the safety and security of Ukraines nuclear facilities must stop immediately,\" Director General Grossi said.\n\nAt the ZNPP, the IAEA team of experts said the plants emergency diesel generators eight of which had been operating since the loss of off-site power around 3:30pm yesterday were switched off shortly before 9am this morning, after the plants access to both its main 750 kilovolt (kV) and back-up 330 kV lines was re-established.\n\nFour of the reactor units remain in cold shutdown, while the two other units have been returned to hot shutdown again enabling them to provide steam to the plant and heat to the nearby city of Enerhodar after being cooled down following yesterdays power loss. Enerhodar where many plant workers live is also receiving electricity again. The ZNPP has lost access to external electricity several times in recent months, for example in early November when it took two days to restore off-site power.\n\nReactors need power for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions also when they are in shutdown and do not produce electricity anymore. In the case of an external power loss, they have emergency diesel generators that can provide back-up electricity for a limited period of time, usually at least for several days and 10 days or more in the case of the ZNPP. Four trucks with diesel fuel have arrived at the site to refill the tanks, the IAEA team reported today.\n\nThe need for secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites is one of the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security during an armed conflict that the Director General outlined early during the conflict.\n\nThe IAEA team of experts also reported that repair work following the weekend shelling at the ZNPP site is continuing.",

IAEA head Rafael Grossi said the attacks were extremely disturbing and completely unacceptable.\n\n\"Whoever is behind this, it must stop immediately. As I have said many times before, youre playing with fire!\" Grossi said in a statement.\n\nRussia and Ukraine blamed each other for the shelling of the facility, as they have done repeatedly in recent months after attacks on it or near it.\n\nCiting information provided by plant management, an IAEA team on the ground said there had been damage to some buildings, systems and equipment, but none of them critical for nuclear safety and security.\n\nThe team plans to conduct an assessment on Monday, Grossi said, but Russian nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom said there would be curbs on what the team could inspect.\n\n\"If they want to inspect a facility that has nothing to do with nuclear safety, access will be denied,\" Renat Karchaa, an adviser to Rosenergoatoms CEO, told the Tass news agency.\n\nRepeated shelling of the plant has raised concern about a grave accident just 500 km from the site of the worlds worst nuclear accident, the 1986 Chornobyl disaster.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant provided about a fifth of Ukraines electricity before Russias invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times. It has six Soviet-designed VVER-1000 V-320 water-cooled and water-moderated reactors containing Uranium 235.\n\nThe reactors are shut down but there is a risk that nuclear fuel could overheat if the power driving the cooling systems is cut. Shelling has repeatedly cut power lines.\n\nRussias defence ministry said Ukraine fired shells at power lines supplying the plant but Ukraines nuclear energy firm Energoatom accused Russias military of shelling the site, saying the Russians had targeted infrastructure necessary to restart parts of the plant in an attempt to further limit Ukraines power supply.\n\nEast under Russian fire\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, Russian forces battered Ukrainian front-line positions with artillery fire, with the heaviest attacks in the Donetsk region, Zelenskyy said in a video address.\n\nRussia withdrew its forces from the southern city of Kherson this month and moved some of them to reinforce positions in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, an industrial area known as the Donbas.\n\n\"The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there were fewer attacks today due to worsening weather, the amount of Russian shelling unfortunately remains extremely high,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"In the Luhansk region, we are slowly moving forward while fighting. As of now, there have been almost 400 artillery attacks in the east since the start of the day,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy also said troops in the south were \"consistently and very calculatedly destroying the potential of the occupiers\" but gave no details.\n\nKherson city remains without electricity, running water or heating.\n\nUkraine said on Saturday that about 60 Russian soldiers had been killed in a long-range artillery attack in the south, the second time in four days that Ukraine has claimed to have inflicted major casualties in a single incident.\n\nRussias defence ministry said on Sunday that up to 50 Ukrainian servicemen were killed the previous day along the southern Donetsk front line and 50 elsewhere.\n\nReuters was not able to immediately verify any battlefield reports.\n\nRussia calls its invasion of Ukraine a \"special operation\" to demilitarize and \"denazify\" its neighbour, though Kyiv and its allies say the invasion is an unprovoked war of aggression.\n\nOleh Zhdanov, a military analyst in Kyiv, said that according to his information, Russian offensives were taking place on the Bakhmut and Avdiivka front line in the Donetsk region, among others.\n\n\"The enemy is trying to break through our defences, to no avail,\" Zhdanov said in a social media video. \"We fight back they suffer huge losses.\"\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

Residents of the two southern regions, which were shelled regularly by Russian forces in the past months, have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, said Ukraines deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. The government would provide transportation, accommodation and medical care, she added. The evacuations come just over a week after Ukraine retook the city of Kherson which remains close to the frontline and areas around it. Interactive The liberation marked a major battlefield gain, while the evacuations highlight the difficulties Ukraine is facing after heavy Russian shelling of its power infrastructure as winter sets in. The wars southern front has been the recent focus of efforts for both Russian and Ukrainian forces before Russias retreat from Kherson. More recently, however, Moscow appears to be building up forces and increasing its military efforts on the eastern Donbas front where the two sides have been locked in a bitter and inconclusive struggle for months, not least around the key town of Bakhmut.

The WHO has documented 703 attacks on health infrastructure since Russias invasion of Ukraine began, said the organisations regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge. In a speech in Kyiv, Kluge described such attacks as a \"breach of international humanitarian law and the rules of war\". The attacks on health and energy infrastructure have left hundreds of hospitals and healthcare facilities \"no longer fully operational, lacking fuel, water and electricity to meet basic needs\", he said. He said: This winter will be life-threatening for millions of people in Ukraine. The devastating energy crisis, the deepening mental health emergency, constraints on humanitarian access and the risk of viral infections will make this winter a formidable test for the Ukrainian health system and the Ukrainian people, but also for the world and its commitment to support Ukraine. He warned \"cold weather can kill\" as 10 million in Ukraine are without power in temperatures that are expected to drop to -20C in parts of the country. Ukraines health system is facing its darkest days in the war so far. Having endured more than 700 attacks, it is now also a victim of the energy crisis. He also called for a \"humanitarian health corridor\" to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. The WHO and its partners would be \"ready to mobilise at a moments notice\" to create routes to allow crucial supplies to be sent to areas that are hard to reach. He expressed particular concern for 17,000 patients in Donetsk, who he said may soon run out of critical antiretroviral drugs that keep them alive. Kluge added: This war must end, before the health system and the health of the Ukrainian nation are compromised any further.\n\nUpdated at 12.16 EST\n\n21 Nov 2022 11.00 EST Summary of the day so far Its 6pm in Kyiv.

The piece reads: As they head into a cold winter, residents of a bombed-out Ukrainian village say they appreciate a warm bath in a mural painted by graffiti artist Banksy. The mural, showing a man scrubbing his back in a bathtub, is on the ground floor of what remains of an apartment block hit in a Russian attack in March in Horenka, northwest of Kyiv, once on the front line where Russias assault on the capital was halted. \"For me, it means washing off all the dirt. The dirt of the Russian Federation ...,\" Tetiana Reznychenko, 43, told Reuters as snow fell around her. \"And this drawing makes me feel as if I have cleansed myself of the dirt that descended on us.\" The mural is one of one of seven that Banksy has confirmed painting in Ukraine. Reznychenko said she had given Banksys team a mug of instant coffee in her apartment, as it was cold when the artist came to paint the mural. She has a wood stove in her apartment but no electricity, heating or running water as winter sets in. \"Winter has begun, and we dont know what will happen next. Firemen brought us non-drinking water ... but it will freeze unless we move it inside,\" she said. Despite the problems, she and her neighbours remain defiant. \"Ukrainians adapt to everything. No light? No problem.

Russian flags, uniforms and helmets emerge from the putrid mud, while hundreds of seagulls and dozens of stray dogs scavenge around. As the Russian occupation of the region was on its last legs over the summer, the site, once a mundane place where residents disposed of their rubbish, became a no-go area, according to Khersons inhabitants, fiercely sealed off by the invading forces from presumed prying eyes. A Russian flag in the mud of the Kherson landfill. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian The reason for the jittery secrecy, several residents and workers at the site told the Guardian, was that the occupying forces had a gruesome new purpose there: dumping the bodies of their fallen brethren, and then burning them. The residents report seeing Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a terrifying stench of burning flesh. They believe the Russians were disposing of the bodies of its soldiers killed during the heavy fighting of those summer days. \"Every time our army shelled the Russians there, they moved the remains to the landfill and burned them,\" says Iryna, 40, a Kherson resident.

Rosatom CEO, Alexei Likhachev, was cited by Interfax news agency as saying: The plant is at risk of a nuclear accident. We were in negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) all night. Rosatom has controlled the nuclear facility, Europes largest, since President Vladimir Putin ordered the formal seizure of the plant. Likhachevs warning came amid renewed shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant, following reports from the IAEA that powerful explosions had shaken the area on Saturday night and Sunday. More than a dozen blasts have been reported from apparent shelling, with damage to some buildings, systems and equipment, but \"none so far critical for nuclear safety\", the IAEA said. Moscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for the attacks. Likhachev accused Ukraine of being willing to \"accept\" a \"small nuclear incident\", adding: This will be a precedent that will forever change the course of history.

In an update posted on Facebook, it said officials had inspected \"four premises\" where Russian troops \"illegally detained people and brutally tortured them\". It said Russian forces \"set up pseudo-law enforcement agencies\" in pre-trial detention centres and a police station in the captured city. The statement continued: Parts of rubber batons, a wooden bat, a device used by the Russians to torture civilians with electric shocks, an incandescent lamp and bullets from the walls were recovered. People in cells and basements were subjected to various methods of torture, physical and psychological violence. Inside the basement of one of the sites, officials \"discovered part of a metal-plastic pipe, handcuffs\", it said.",

The Kremlin has, in recent weeks, carried out a campaign of bombings and airstrikes on Ukrainian infrastructure designed to cripple Kyivs ability to provide heat to its residents as winter approaches.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry alleged that the blasts at Zaporizhzhia were the result of artillery fired by the Ukrainian military.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly accused Russian forces of storing heavy weaponry inside the complex and using it as cover to launch attacks, knowing that Ukraine cant return fire without risking hitting one of the plants reactors.\n\nCNN is unable to verify the claims by Energoatom or the Russian government.\n\nGrossi and the IAEA have repeatedly called for both sides to implement a nuclear safety and security zone around Zaporizhzhia, Europes largest nuclear power plant. Grossi has taken part in \"intense consultations with Ukraine and Russia about establishing such a zone, but so far without an agreement,\" the IAEA said.\n\nSkirmishes near Zaporizhzhia have taken place intermittently since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and seized the plant days later. Intense shelling near the complex this summer sparked concerns of a nuclear accident, prompting the IAEA to send a team there.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree in October federalizing the plant which is located about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the city and sits in Russian occupied territory along the Dnipro River. The move sparked concerns over the fate of the Ukrainian technicians who have operated the plant since its occupation by Russian forces.\n\nThe blasts on Saturday and Sunday ended what the IAEA said was \"a relative period of calm.\"",

Such actions are prohibited by international humanitarian law,\" the statement said.\n\nDuring the pre-trial investigation, measures will be taken to establish all the circumstances of this event, as well as to provide a legal assessment of all its participants, it added.\n\nOn Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists that Russia will do \"everything possible\" to search for those responsible, adding that they must be \"punished.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, commented on the incident on Sunday, claiming the Russians staged a surrender and opened fire first, adding that \"returning fire is not a war crime.\"\n\nWhat the video appears to show: The edited video purports to show captured Russian soldiers in an act of surrender, with several men lying on the ground on their fronts with their hands over their heads. More soldiers are seen emerging one by one from a building and lying down next to them in the yard.\n\nA voice apparently directing the surrender can be heard shouting: \"Come on out, one by one. Which of you is the officer? Has everyone come out? Come out!\"\n\nAfter about 10 men are down on the ground, another soldier emerges from the same building and appears to open fire in the direction of the Ukrainian soldiers conducting the surrender.\n\nA short burst of gunfire is heard before the video clip ends abruptly.\n\nA second clip filmed later from a drone above the same location shows the bodies of what appear to be the same Russian soldiers in the yard, most just a few meters from where they had been lying in the first clip.\n\nCNN has been unable to verify exactly what happened in the first video clip, and it is unclear exactly what happened in the period that elapsed between the first clip and the filming of the drone footage.\n\nCNN's Olga Voitovych and Radina Gigova contributed reporting to this post.",

Power outages in Lviv and Moldova amid fresh missile strikes\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUkraine says that Russia once again pounded its energy infrastructure on Wednesday with multiple missile strikes.\n\nA number of regions, including the capital Kyiv, reported power outages after hearing explosions and anti-aircraft air sirens.\n\nThe Kyiv city administration said that three people were dead and six wounded in the capital after a Russian strike hit a two-story building.\n\nMayor Vitali Klitschko said that \"one of the capitals infrastructure facilities has been hit\" and that water supplies were knocked out in all of Kyiv.\n\nThere were also power outages in the northern city of Kharkiv, the western city of Lviv, and in the southern Odesa region, while three Ukrainian nuclear power plants were \"disconnected\" from the electricity grid.\n\nIn Moldova, Infrastructure Minister Andrei Spinu also said that \"we have massive power outages across the country\".\n\nRussia has repeatedly fired on Ukraine's infrastructure in recent weeks, leaving up to 10 million people without electricity.\n\nMoscow says strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are a consequence of Kyiv being unwilling to negotiate.\n\n2. Baby killed in Russian strike on maternity hospital, says Ukraine\n\nA newborn baby was killed after an overnight rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine, authorities said.\n\nThe strike -- which Kyiv has blamed on Russia -- hit the two-story building in the town of Vilniansk, near Zaporizhzhia. Russia has always denied targeting civilians.\n\nThe babys mother and a doctor were reportedly pulled alive from the rubble.\n\n\"At night, Russian monsters launched huge rockets at the small maternity ward of the hospital in Vilniansk,\" regional governor Oleksandr Starukh wrote on Telegram.\n\n\"Grief overwhelms our hearts a baby was killed who had just seen the light of day. Rescuers are working at the site.\"\n\nThe State Emergency Service initially said that the baby, new mother, and doctor were the only people in the hospital ward at the time.\n\nUkrainian firefighters work at the damaged hospital maternity ward in Vilniansk. Zaporizhzhia region military administration via AP\n\nZaporizhzhia is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia illegally annexed in September after internationally condemned sham referendums.\n\n\"The terrorist state continues to wage war on civilians,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Telegram, adding that Russia would be held accountable for the strike on Vilniansk.\n\n\"The enemy has once again decided to try to accomplish through terror and murder what it has not been able to accomplish in nine months\".\n\nIn the northeastern region of Kharkiv, another Russian rocket on Wednesday reportedly killed two people. Regional governor Oleg Synegoubov said the victims were a 55-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne person was hospitalised and another received first aid at the scene, he said, adding that the bombing hit a residential building and a hospital.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has so far recorded more than 700 attacks on Ukrainian health facilities since the Russian invasion began on February 24.\n\n3. Ukraine promises free shelter to citizens ahead of harsh winter\n\nUkraine has promised to provide free shelter to evacuating citizens ahead of a harsh winter and amid relentless Russian strikes.\n\nSpecial \"invincibility centres\" will be set up across the country to provide electricity, water, internet, and a pharmacy, President Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on Tuesday.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has begun relocating citizens from recently recaptured cities to areas where heating and security problems are less acute.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe head of national grid operator Ukrenergo has described the damage to Ukraine's infrastructure was \"colossal\".\n\n\"If massive Russian strikes happen again and its clear power will not be restored for hours, the 'invincibility centres' will go into action with all key services,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said this week that around 8,500 power generator sets are being imported to Ukraine each day.\n\nAuthorities have warned of power cuts that could affect millions of people until the end of March and have urged citizens to stock up on \"warm clothes and blankets\".\n\nTemperatures commonly stay below freezing in Ukraine in the winter, and snow has already fallen in many areas, including Kyiv.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn Wednesday, Pope Francis linked the suffering of Ukrainians to the 1930s famine \"artificially caused\" by Soviet leader Josef Stalin, where more than 3 million people were killed.\n\n4. European Parliament declares Russia a 'state sponsor' of terror\n\nThe European Parliament has voted to declare Russia a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" over its \"illegal, unprovoked, and unjustified war of aggression\" in Ukraine.\n\nMEPs stated that Moscow has inflicted \"brutal and inhumane\" upon Ukraine and its citizens.\n\n\"The deliberate attacks and atrocities carried out by the Russian Federation against the civilian population of Ukraine, the destruction of civilian infrastructure, and other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law amount to acts of terror against the Ukrainian population and constitute war crimes,\" MEPs the non-binding resolution read.\n\nA total of 494 lawmakers voted in favour of the symbolic text, with 58 against and 44 abstentions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe EU's 27 member states have now been urged to develop a new legal framework to designate an entire country as a state sponsor of terror.\n\nCurrently, the bloc's legislation only allows the EU to blacklist specific individuals and organisations.\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova slammed the European Parliament's decision as \"idiotic\".\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nUK Sea-King helicopters fly past during D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth. CARL COURT / AFP, FILE\n\n5. UK sends its first helicopter to Ukraine since Russia's invasion\n\nThe United Kingdom has shipped its first helicopter to Ukraine since Russia launched the invasion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBritish Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said London planned to send two more aircraft in the coming months, as well as an additional 10,000 rounds of artillery.\n\n\"Our support for Ukraine is unwavering. These additional artillery rounds will help Ukraine to secure the land it has reclaimed from Russia in recent weeks,\" Wallace said in a ministry statement.\n\n\"The first shipment of Sea King helicopters is coming to Ukraine to provide critical search and rescue capabilities,\" he added.\n\nThe UK has been one of Kyiv's strongest donors of military aid, sending air defence systems and drones, but the delivery of a Sea King helicopter is the first time that the UK has sent manned aircraft to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the statement, the British Army has trained 10 Ukrainian army teams and engineers to operate the helicopters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe announcement comes after UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited Kyiv on Saturday and announced 57.4 million in military aid and 18.3 million in humanitarian aid.\n\nThe military aid is said to include \"125 anti-aircraft guns and technology\" to counter drones that were supplied to Russia by Iran.\n\nThe ministry also claimed that Russia has nearly exhausted its current stock of Iran-made weapons and will seek resupply.\n\n6. Moldova promises to pay for Russian gas blocked in Ukraine\n\nMoldova's government has stated that it will pay for natural gas that has been supplied by Russia but is allegedly being blocked in Ukraine.\n\nGazprom has accused Kyiv of siphoning off 52.5 million cubic metres of gas destined for Moldova and threatened to start cutting deliveries from Monday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Russian state energy giant has already cut its gas exports to Chisinau by half.\n\n\"To be clear, all gas delivered to Moldova ends up in our country,\" Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu said on Wednesday.\n\n\"The volumes of gas Gazprom refers to that remain in Ukraine are our reserves and they are stored in warehouses in Ukraine,\" he added.\n\n\"Our country has always paid for these quantities and will continue to pay for them in full.\"\n\nEuropean countries regularly accuse Moscow of energy blackmail over their support for Ukraine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"This is not the first time that Russia resorts to using gas as a tool of political pressure,\" said Olha Belkova of the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine.\n\n\"This is a gross manipulation of facts in order to justify the decision to further limit the volume of gas supplies to European countries.\"\n\nHeading into winter when natural gas is needed to heat homes as well as generate electricity and power factories, any reductions in supplies could mean higher prices, fueling inflation.\n\nNatural gas prices have fallen since August peaks and European nations have been able to fill their storage capacity for winter, but the crunch could worsen if the weather turns out to be colder than normal.\n\nMoldova relied heavily on Russian energy before the war and its Soviet-era energy systems remain interconnected with Ukraine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA recent international aid conference in Paris raised more than 100 million euros to support Moldova through its energy crisis. Earlier this month, the European Union also pledged the country 250 million euros in aid.\n\n7. US to send Ukraine 385 million in weapons and ammunition\n\nThe US is sending another $400 million (385 million) in weapons, ammunition, and generators to Ukraine, the White House announced on Wednesday.\n\nWashington said it would source the supplies from its own stockpiles in order to get the support to Kyiv as fast as possible.\n\nIncluding the latest aid, the US has now committed more than $19 billion (18.3 billion) in weapons and other equipment to Ukraine since February.\n\nThe move comes as Russia continues to target Ukraines energy sources ahead of the winter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the continued push of weapons to Kyiv is raising questions about how long the US and Western allies can continue to sustain the fight without impacting their own military readiness.\n\nMany European nations have already stated that they have sent Ukraine all the excess they can afford.\n\nThe US and 45 partner nations recently discussed Ukraines top priorities, including more air defense systems and long-range weapons, at a meeting in Brussels.\n\nThe flow of weapons comes as the Biden administration seeks to pass an additional $37 billion (35.7 billion) in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine before Republicans take over control of the House in January.",

                "cc_text": "When a missile slammed into a Polish village Tuesday, killing two farmers, it brought Russias war on Ukraine directly to the territory of a NATO ally. The immediate uncertainties included media speculation, and an assertion by Ukraines government, that Russia had struck Poland, risking a direct NATO response and an expansion of the war. That immediate threat eased as evidence grew that a Ukrainian air defense missile had strayed but the incident illustrated that the dangers of an escalated war are real. The only true remedy for this threat is for Russia to stop waging war against Ukraine.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nAfter the missile explosion, Polish President Andrzej Duda reported it was a Russian-made rocket, but in a war between post-Soviet countries whose munitions share a Soviet heritage, that fact clarified little. Duda noted it was unclear who had fired the missile. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, asserted it was a Russian attack; the Russians denied the claims.\n\nThe missile strike risked deadly consequences beyond the tragic deaths in the farming village of Przewodw. Poland is a member of NATO, covered by the alliances treaty, which says of its members, \"an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.\" Thus a Russian attack would confront NATO with the decision whether to defend its ally or undermine confidence in the alliance. In short, the risk of a potentially disastrous expansion of the war was very real.\n\nOn Wednesday, it became increasingly clear that this was likely not a Russian attack that required a NATO response. Meeting with other NATO leaders at the Group of 20 summit in Indonesia, President Joe Biden said initial indications were that it was not a Russian missile and that Russia had not fired it. Duda and others reported it was probably Ukraines missile, fired in defense against a Russian rocket barrage against that country.\n\nUkraine has a right and a responsibility to defend its citizens. If the missile that landed in Poland was in fact a Ukrainian-launched missile, that makes Russia no less responsible for the deaths of the two Polish farmers. Without the Russian attacks there would be no need for a Ukrainian defense. Ukraine, by defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity, is in essence defending the post-World War II global order based upon respect for borders and the peaceful resolution of interstate conflicts.\n\nCrisis Averted, But Risks Remain\n\nNATO appears to accept Dudas explanation and the Russian denials of an attack. The incident, however, reveals starkly how this war threatens populations beyond Ukraine. One stray or intentional missile strike could risk a Europe-wide war. (The danger to 44 million Ukrainians has been agonizingly clear for months: tens of thousands of civilians killed, wounded or subjected to torture. Russias methodical destruction of critical civilian infrastructure, one of a series of evident Russian crimes in the war, threatens even greater suffering.)\n\nRussias nine-month war on Ukraine has included repeated threats of what specialists call \"vertical escalation\" to greater levels of violence. Most alarming have been threats of nuclear destruction, such as the risk of an accident or sabotage from Russias seizure of Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials threatened in September that Moscow could use nuclear weapons and accused Ukraine of preparing to use a radioactive \"dirty bomb.\" The U.S. government described that allegation as a provocation and bluntly warned Russia that any nuclear weapons use would be a \"serious mistake.\"\n\nThe sudden missile explosion in a Polish farming village is the latest of several incidents that underscore the enduring risk of a \"horizontal escalation\" an expansion of this war to other countries:\n\nRussias war also poses continued risks to civilian maritime safety in the Black Sea, the International Maritime Organization has warned. Three of the Black Seas six littoral states are NATO members.\n\nTwo Realities\n\nThe tragedy in Poland this week shows the world two realities that governments and policy advocates worldwide must acknowledge.\n\nThe first is how quickly the shock of a missile strike into a third country ignited fearful speculation through social and news media and how quickly NATO member states and the alliances secretariat eased the immediate risks with sober, factual assessments. Effectively, the incident served as a successful test of NATOs repeated commitments to de-escalate this conflict wherever it can. Governments and others who value the stability of international law and accepted borders and that abhor the current risks of escalation, including the Kremlins nuclear threats should note to each other and to Russia the imperative to sustain that de-escalatory approach.\n\nThe second reality is that only one remedy can fully prevent the risk of an escalated war: Russia must cease its war of aggression, defined after World War II as \"the supreme international crime,\" against Ukraine. The post-World War II security architecture has been based upon a rejection of 19th century ideologies that viewed war as an acceptable extension of policy. Indeed, the United Nations was established in 1945 \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\" As one of the United Nations co-founders and a member of its Security Council, Russia has a responsibility to live up to the commitments it has made.\n\nThe United States and the rest of the world must continue to press Russia to end its aggression. That is the only way to eliminate suffering and mitigate the danger of greater conflict.",

There should be no room for terror in the world,\" Zelensky said.\n\nZelensky emphasized the need for \"modern and effective air and missile defense systems\" after detailing the series of Russian air strikes that destroyed critical facilities, including energy infrastructure, residential housing, and a hospital, where a newborn baby in the hospital's maternity ward was killed.\n\nThis large-scale assault on energy infrastructure also led to widespread energy blackouts in Ukraine and neighboring Moldova, an act Zelensky said was \"analogous to using weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\n\"When the temperature outside drops below zero and tens of millions of people are left without electricity, heat and water as a result of Russian missiles hitting energy facilities, that is an obvious crime against humanity,\" Zelensky stated.\n\nUS Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield was one of several representatives to reiterate their support for Ukraine, with emphasis on condemning Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.\n\n\"Putin's motive could not be more clear and more cold-blooded.

                "cc_text": "November 16, 2022\n\nThank you, President.\n\nI thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for her briefing.\n\nThe missile incident yesterday in Poland, despite its origin or intentionality, is of great concern. We offer our condolences to the families of the victims of this regrettable event. The incident reminds us that the risk of escalation is real and obliges us to redouble efforts to find an urgent diplomatic solution that will put an end to the suffering of the civilian population throughout the region.\n\nI will refer to four issues.\n\nFirst, I would like to highlight the humanitarian situation. In addition to the accrued damage of the nine months of conflict, we now witness the compounded destruction of electrical infrastructure and the onset of winter. The lack of electricity compromises many other basic services. I will mention one: water supply. This creates an even higher risk for the lives and health of millions of civilians.\n\nIf the deterioration of living conditions continues, it will generate a new wave of displacements at a time when host communities are already at capacity. The figures speak for themselves: 7.8 million Ukrainians have fled their country and another 6 million are internally displaced.\n\nIn this context, humanitarian aid becomes indispensable for survival, especially for the most vulnerable. We reiterate our call to allow unrestricted access to all areas where there is civilian population, including the occupied areas oblasts where \"martial law\" has been decreed.\n\nAlthough less evident, the conflict has had serious consequences on the mental health of the population. The deaths of more than 400 children and the 279 missing are a clear example of this and a dramatic glimpse of the pain that this war is causing.\n\nMexico reiterates the importance of including psychosocial support services in all humanitarian response strategies. The impact on mental health will be felt long after the conflict ends, so it will be essential to develop a long-term strategy to address this dimension of the conflict. A dimension as silent as it is painful.\n\nSecondly, I will touch upon the issue of nuclear safety. The situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) remains concerning. We reiterate our call to establish a protection and safety zone around ZNPP, as proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nMexico recognizes the work of the IAEA, in particular the verification of three sites which had been pointed out by one of the Parties about activities undertaken. We note the IAEA concluded that there is no evidence of nuclear activity or undeclared materials. We will closely follow the results of the visits to other nuclear power plants, as well as to the Chornobyl site, in the coming weeks.\n\nWhile the situation at the ZNPP plant is undoubtedly critical, it should be emphasized that during a conflict -such as this one- all nuclear facilities have the potential unleash a catastrophe for the population and the environment.\n\nThirdly, I would like to refer to the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which, as was mentioned today, has been instrumental in helping mitigate food insecurity that disproportionately affects developing countries.\n\nTherefore, it is essential that the agreement is renewed and fully implemented, included the facilitation of access to global markets of Russian food products and fertilizers, including ammonia. We recognize the efforts made by the Secretary-General to remove the immense range of obstacles faced in the exportation of these products.\n\nThe agreements have been a beacon of hope for those of us who believe in dialogue and diplomacy as means to find a solution to the conflict, despite the many differences that sometimes seem insurmountable.\n\nFinally, President, I would point out that it is essential that international investigations to ensure accountability continue. Perpetrators of crimes in this conflict must be brought to justice. The international community owes this to the victims and their families. We will therefore follow closely the work of the International Criminal Court in this regard.\n\nI conclude by reiterating that Mexico insists on the exploration of new formulas that could advance mediation and dialogue, to bring this war to an end. Mexico reiterates its support for the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\n\nThank you.",

Ukraine's new ambassador to Germany has asked Berlin for generators as well as more weapons. DW has the latest.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has denied reports that Russia intends to give up the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, saying it is still under Russian control and will remain so.\n\n\"There's no need to look for signs where there are none and cannot be any,\" Peskov told reporters in a briefing on Monday.\n\nHis remarks came after the head of Ukraine's state-run nuclear energy company said there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to vacate what is Europe's biggest nuclear plant, which they seized in March shortly after invading Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak also said late on Sunday that he was sure Russian forces would leave the plant.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia have warned of the danger of a nuclear catastrophe, while accusing one another of shelling the six-reactor complex.\n\nThe two countries were both badly affected by the world's worst nuclear accident in Chernobyl, northern Ukraine, in 1986.\n\nUkrainian staff are still working at the plant despite the Russian takeover.\n\nHere are the other main headlines from the war in Ukraine on Monday, November 28:\n\nZelenskyy: Russia shelled Kherson nearly 260 times this week\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said intense and consistent Russian strikes on the Kherson region have destroyed a water pumping station, as he continued to warn of intense and incessant Russian shelling of his country.\n\nIn his nightly video address on Monday, Zelenskyy said that Russians have shelled 30 settlements in the southern Kherson region nearly 260 times this past week. He said a pumping station which supplies water to the city of Mykolaiv, northwest of Kherson, has been damaged as a result.\n\nRussian forces retreated from Kherson earlier this month but have been shelling towns and villages in the region since.\n\nOn his previous nightly address on Sunday, Zelenskyy warned Ukrainians of another cold and dark week ahead.\n\nUkraine's first lady urges global response to sexual assault in war\n\nRussian soldiers must be held accountable for using sexual violence as a weapon of war in Ukraine, the country's first lady Olensa Zelenska said.\n\n\"The opportunities for the occupiers widened to humiliating Ukrainians and unfortunately, sexual violence and sexual crimes are within their arsenal,\" she told delegates at the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative conference in London.\n\n\"Everyone knows about the huge numbers of rapes,\" Zelenska said. \"They're (Russian soldiers) very open about this.\"\n\nUK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly praised Zelenskas efforts to highlight the \"horrific use of sexual violence by Russian forces.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian government has launched a support program to help victims of the war, which Zelenska said she hoped could be a \"first step towards an investigation and prosecution\".\n\n\"There has to be a global response to this. Unfortunately, such war crimes will keep on going in the world as long as the servicemen think that they can go without any punishment.\"\n\nZelenska also visited Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's official residence at No. 10 Downing Street and was greeted by Sunak's wife Akshata Murty.\n\nShe is expected to address British lawmakers on Tuesday as part of her UK visit.\n\nUkraine runs test imports of Romanian electricity\n\nUkrainian state energy trading company EKU said it had conducted a test import of one megawatt of power from Romania.\n\n\"The import of electricity can become an additional tool for stabilizing the energy system of Ukraine,\" EKU said.\n\nUkraine has grappled with energy shortages and blackouts following waves of Russian strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure.\n\nUkraine lawmaker says air defense a top priority in war against Russia\n\nUkrainian lawmaker Kira Ruddick told DW that Ukraine needs air defense systems from the West more than anything else to preserve what remains of the countrys infrastructure against continuous Russian strikes.\n\nRuddick said her country was now receiving from western allies weapons, supplies and spare parts to help rebuild the energy infrastructure.\n\nRuddick said Russia was \"weaponizing everything\" to win the war, ranging from food to electricity, and nuclear plants.\n\n\"They are doing everything possible and impossible to win the war. However, they are losing on the military side,\" she said.\n\nShe said that half of Kyivs population was currently without electricity and heat. However, she warned that the lack of connectivity was the most dangerous weapon Russia was using against the Ukrainian people.\n\nRuddick also warned that despite its assurances, Russia might attack the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant, the largest in Europe. She stressed that if that happens, it could be another Chernobyl.\n\n\"We know that radiation is not picking who has which passport. And it would be a generational tragedy to so many people, to so many nations.\"\n\nNATO's Stoltenberg says Putin winter as 'weapon'\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Russia will likely continue targeting critical Ukrainian infrastructure and basic services.\n\n\"Doing that when we enter winter demonstrates that President (Vladimir) Putin is now trying to use ... the winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nUkraine war increases chemical weapons threat watchdog\n\nThe war in Ukraine has increased the threat from weapons of mass destruction, the world's chemical weapons regulator said.\n\n\"The situation in Ukraine has again increased the real threat posed by weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons,\" Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) chief Fernando Arias said.\n\n\"It has exacerbated existing tensions to a point where unity of the international community on common global challenges related to international security and peace cannot be presumed,\" he added.\n\nArias said that the Hague-based OPCW and other international disarmament bodies have \"become places for confrontation and disagreement.\" Kyiv and Moscow have traded allegations over the possible use of nuclear and chemical weapons since the start of the war.\n\nThe organization \"continues to closely monitor this serious situation and remains in contact with the permanent representations of the Russian Federation and Ukraine,\" Arias stressed.\n\nThe OCPW chief added that the organization has provided Kyiv with training for first responders of chemical attacks and for the detection of chemical leaks.\n\nEU agrees to give itself legal powers to punish sanction violators\n\nEuropean Union member states on Monday unanimously agreed to make violations of sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine an \"EU crime\" that can be prosecuted throughout the bloc.\n\nThe EU will thus be able to take action against those who help Russia avoid the restrictive measures taken against it.\n\nThe move will help standardize the interpretation and enforcement of EU sanctions law across all 27 countries making up the union.\n\n\"Currently, member states have different definitions of what constitutes a violation of restrictive measures and what penalties should be applied in the event of violation,\" said a statement issued by the bloc's current Czech presidency.\n\n\"This could lead to different degrees of enforcement of sanctions and a risk of these measures being circumvented, potentially allowing sanctioned persons to continue accessing their assets and supporting regimes targeted by EU measures,\" the statement added.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive body, will now draw up a proposed legal directive that will then be submitted to the member states and the European Parliament.\n\nUS-Russia nuclear disarmament talks postponed\n\nTalks in Cairo between Russia and the US on resuming inspections under the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty have been postponed, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday in response to a question.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper cited the US Embassy as saying that the talks had been postponed unilaterally by Moscow.\n\nThe talks were to have taken place in the Egyptian capital between November 29 and December 6.\n\nThe inspections had been suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMoscow has been accused of nuclear brinkmanship in statements Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have made regarding the possibility of atomic weapons being employed to defend Russian territory. Moscow claims to have \"annexed\" parts of Ukraine, making it unclear what the Kremlin might consider its own.\n\nUkrainian ambassador asks Berlin for generators\n\nThe new Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Oleksii Makeiev, has called on Berlin to provide his country with equipment to counter the power cuts caused by recent Russian missile attacks.\n\n\"We need generators and car transformers, which are particularly affected by Russian missile attacks,\" Makeiev told public broadcaster ZDF on Monday.\n\nMakeiev said that the capital, Kyiv, has electricity only for a few hours per day after the massive damage to energy infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe ambassador however also reiterated the need for more air-defense systems and other weapons from Germany, saying: \"German weapons save lives.\"\n\nMakeiev said his main concern was to build and maintain trust.\n\n\"We need this support from Germany very much,\" he said.\n\nUkraine power outages: Nick Connolly reports from Kyiv To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nUkraine warns of more Russian aerial attacks\n\nUkrainian officials have warned that Russian forces are preparing a fresh wave of missile attacks targeting energy infrastructure.\n\nA Ukraine military spokesperson said a Russian warship capable of firing cruise missiles had recently deployed to the Black Sea with Kalibr-type missiles on board, indicating that preparations were underway.\n\nThis comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky also said in an address to Ukrainians late on Sunday that Russia was preparing new aerial attacks.\n\nHe said Russia's military would continue such attacks \"as long as they have missiles.\"\n\nRepeated Russian attacks in recent days have disrupted power and water supplies to millions over recent weeks as winter sets in.\n\nRussia has said it targets only infrastructure linked to military use and has blamed the blackouts on Kyiv's refusal to negotiate with Moscow.\n\nMore coverage of the war in Ukraine\n\nDW's Ihor Burdyga, who hails from Kherson in southern Ukraine, describes life in his home town after it was liberated from the Russian forces that held it for months.\n\nAnd there have been calls for Russia to pay for the damage it has inflicted on Ukraine. DW looks at how realistic the prospects of this occurring are.\n\nrmt, tj/ar, kb (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)",

                "cc_text": "Hours after the Russian Federation launched a barrage of missile and drone strikes attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure across Ukraine overnight, a United Nations senior official condemned such attacks and demanded they stop, stressing to the Security Council that they are prohibited under international humanitarian law, as that 15-nation organ held an emergency meeting on the matter today.\n\nRosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, reported that widespread attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure are continuing across Ukraine, with devastating consequences. Overnight, a new wave of missile and drone strikes terrorized the people of Kyiv and other cities in the country. Ukrainian officials stated that there were practically no large thermal or hydroelectric power plants left intact in Ukraine, she said, pointing to fears that this winter will be catastrophic for millions of Ukrainians who could be without heating, electricity or water amid freezing temperatures.\n\n\"I will say it once again: attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law,\" she emphasized. \"The United Nations strongly condemns these attacks and demands that the Russian Federation immediately cease these actions,\" she stressed, calling on the international community to ensure that the most vulnerable people in Ukraine are adequately protected and able to cope with the months ahead.\n\nTurning to the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, she called for the immediate cessation of all military activities at, and around, the plant, underscoring that the reported shelling at the plant over the weekend is reckless and deplorable. However, spotlighting a positive development \"amid the dark news of today\", she said the parties reported today yet another prisoner exchange and called on them to continue those releases and ensure that they fulfil their obligations under international law.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, addressing the Council via tele-videoconference, said: \"When the temperature is below zero outside, and tens of millions of people are left without heat and water as a result of Russian missiles hitting energy facilities, this is an obvious crime against humanity.\" He also described the overnight rocket attack on a hospital that took the life of a 2-day-old baby and the 70 rockets aimed at Ukraines energy infrastructure, affecting hospitals, schools and transport.\n\nAlthough the Russian Federation has been trying to turn the 15-member organ into \"a platform for rhetoric and manipulation\", he underscored that Council was created as the worlds most powerful platform for decisions and actions. \"It is time to support the Ukrainian formula for peace. There must be no opportunity left for terror in the world,\" he stressed, calling on the international community to support that peace proposal and for the Council to provide a clear assessment of the Russian Federations actions and consider a resolution condemning any form of energy terror.\n\nIn the ensuing debate, Council members denounced the Russian Federations latest strikes, voicing concern that the resulting mass power outage will further inflict misery on already suffering Ukrainians. They called on the parties to comply with international humanitarian law and described how their countries are assisting Ukrainians to avert a life-threatening winter.\n\nThe representative of the United States, noting that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"weaponizing winter\", said that if he cannot seize the country by force, he will try to \"freeze the country into submission\". There must be a mechanism for accountability, and the international community must do everything in its power to support Ukraines people. For its part, the United States has contributed over $250 million in winterization-specific humanitarian assistance that will help provide heating supplies, blankets, shelter-repair materials and generators, she said.\n\nAlbanias representative emphasized that the Russian Federation may use whatever camouflaged language it has used in the past, but it is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. The European Parliaments landmark resolution confirmed this, recognizing the Russian Federation as a State sponsor of terrorism and as a State that \"uses means of terrorism\", he said. The cause and root lie solely with the Russian Federations aggression, he said, calling once again on that country to stop, withdraw and engage in diplomacy.\n\nKenyas representative, joining other delegations, said: \"We cannot overstress the need to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure from attacks\". Noting the roll-over of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the agreement to ensure the unimpeded export of Russian food and fertilizer, he said unimpeded deliveries must be ensured to countries in need, especially those in Africa. The Secretary-General and his good offices must be leveraged further to bring the war to an end and the Council must explore all options that can lead to the wars cessation, followed by a dialogue for a political solution that guarantees Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nHowever, the Russian Federations representative, countering delegations claims about the attacks, emphasized that his country is conducting strikes against infrastructure in response to the \"unbridled\" flow of weapons into Ukraine and Kyivs reckless appeals to defeat the Russian Federation. Over the course of its special military operation, the Russian Federation has had to deal not only with the Kyiv regimes units, but also the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), who are providing various military support while \"conducting a proxy war with Russia\". Thus, to weaken and destroy the military potential of its opponents, Moscow has conducted precision strikes against energy and other infrastructure used to supply Ukrainian units armed with Western weapons. Weakening Ukraines military capacity will continue by military means until the Kyiv regime adopts a \"realistic position\", he said.\n\nRomanias representative, drawing attention to the wars spillover effects, reported that his country is making its own grain available to partners around the world and will continue to help facilitate Ukrainian exports. To that end, Romania, which shares the largest land border with Ukraine, has inaugurated a new crossing point between the two countries. More so, the Russian attacks have not only put millions of Ukrainians lives at risk because of no access to heat or electricity, they also created a complete blackout today in the Republic of Moldova. For the past month, Romania has been supplying between 80 and 90 per cent of that countrys electricity needs, he noted.\n\nThe representative of the Republic of Moldova, on that point, said todays event left his country with severely disrupted and unavailable power, water supply, internet and mobile phone connection services. The war should stop now to avoid catastrophic humanitarian consequences, he stressed, calling on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its military aggression, withdraw its forces from Ukraines sovereign territory, fully comply with its international law obligations and uphold human rights.\n\nAlso speaking were representatives of Norway, France, Brazil, United Kingdom, Ireland, United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Gabon, China, India and Ghana.\n\nThe meeting began at 4:05 p.m. and ended at 5:33 p.m.\n\nBriefing\n\nROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said relentless, widespread attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure are continuing across Ukraine, with devastating consequences. Overnight, a new wave of missile and drone strikes terrorized the people of Kyiv, Odesa, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia. As Ukrainians desperately sought shelter from the bombing, they also had to contend with freezing temperatures. Those latest attacks renew fears that this winter will be catastrophic for millions of Ukrainians, who face the prospect of months of frigid weather with no heating, electricity, water or other basic utilities.\n\nAccording to initial media reports quoting local authorities, the strikes today killed or injured over 30 civilians as residential buildings were hit in Kyiv and in Chabany and Vyshhorod towns in the outskirts of the capital, she said. The United Nations has also seen reports of an overnight strike on a maternity hospital in the town of Vilnyansk in Zaporizhzhia region where a two-day-old baby was reportedly killed in the attack. Even before the latest strikes, Ukrainian officials stated that there were practically no large thermal or hydroelectric power plants left intact in Ukraine.\n\nTodays barrage is likely to make the situation even worse, she continued. Emergency shutdowns were introduced today in all regions of the country, and regions like Lviv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa and Chernihiv were reportedly completely disconnected from electricity. In Kyiv, Darnytska Thermal Power Plant was hit. All of Kyiv region was reportedly deprived of electricity and the approximately 3 million people of the capital were left without running water. The Ladyzhyn Power Plant in Vinnytsia region was also hit. Russian strikes also damaged energy infrastructure in Kremenchuk, Lviv and Odesa. There are also reports that Odesa has no electricity nor running water. Three nuclear power plants still operating Rivne, South Ukraine, and Khmelnytskyi were reportedly disconnected from Ukraines energy grid as a result of todays attacks. People in neighbouring Republic of Moldova are also likely to suffer consequences, as todays strikes reportedly resulted in a blackout across the Republic of Moldova a country that is already suffering an energy shortage due to the war.\n\nFurther, the World Health Organization warned this week of a life-threatening winter in Ukraine, she said. The international community must ensure that the most vulnerable people in Ukraine are adequately protected and able to cope with the months ahead. Humanitarian actors in Ukraine are working to support people facing the challenges imposed by the energy shortage. Over the past weeks, more than 430,000 people have received some sort of direct winter assistance and nearly 400 generators have been distributed to ensure energy in hospitals, schools and other critical facilities. \"I will say it once again: attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law. So are attacks against military objectives that may be expected to cause harm to civilians that would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated,\" she emphasized.\n\n\"The United Nations strongly condemns these attacks and demands that the Russian Federation immediately cease these actions,\" she stressed, underscoring that there must be accountability for any violations of the laws of war. Voicing concern as well about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant the largest in Europe she underlined that the reported shelling at the plant over the weekend is reckless and deplorable. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed on Monday that despite the severity of the shelling key equipment remained intact and there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns. \"This is the result of sheer luck. We do not know how long this luck will last,\" she said, emphasizing that \"the world cannot afford a nuclear catastrophe\". Highlighting the risks of those attacks, she said that just a couple of hours ago IAEA reported that the plant has lost external electricity access and is relying on diesel generators to power cooling and essential nuclear safety functions. \"All military activities at, and around, the plant must cease immediately,\" she said.\n\n\"Amid the dark news of today, I want to mention a positive development,\" she said, noting that the parties today reported yet another prisoner exchange. Thirty-five Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners were released, she reported, encouraging the parties to continue those releases and to ensure that they fulfil their obligations under international law, particularly the third Geneva Convention. However, she also reported that the temperature in Kyiv right now is said to be -1C, with snow forecast. \"The weather we have been both preparing for, and dreading, is now upon the people of Ukraine,\" she pointed out, emphasizing that the international community must all work together to prevent a man-made humanitarian catastrophe this winter. \"The resulting shocks would exact a heavy price not only on Ukrainians, but on us all,\" she added.\n\nImmediate de-escalation is needed, she stressed, calling once again on Member States and international organizations to support efforts to this end, with respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. The United Nations will continue to do its part on the ground and remains ready to support all efforts towards peace, in line with the Charter of the United Nations and international law.\n\nStatements\n\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, President of Ukraine , addressing the Security Council via tele-videoconference, said his country awaits a firm reaction from those who recognize the Charter of the United Nations. Ukraine has presented its \"peace formula\", consisting of 10 points on how to restore the Charter, violated by the Russian Federation, to its full force, he said, adding: \"In response to our peace formula, Russia is following the path of its terror formula.\" In the wake of his presentation of his proposal to the Group of 19 (G19) summit in Indonesia, Ukraine received \"10 Russian missiles for each point of the peace formula,\" he said. A week after Ukraine outlined the peace formula to the Council on 16 November, the strikes continue.\n\nAfter Ukraine liberated Kherson, and the Russian army fled the city, the Russian Federation began to methodically destroy that city, with daily strikes that targeted people, he continued, reporting that shells hit residential buildings. \"It seems that this is one of the main points of the Russian terror formula,\" he noted. In addition, on the night of 22 November, a rocket attack on a hospital took the life of a 2-day-old baby. Further, on 23 November, there were 70 rockets aimed at Ukraines energy infrastructure, he continued, noting that those strikes affected hospitals, schools and transport. Pointing out that the attacks by the Russian Federation led to a blackout in Ukraine, as well as in the neighbouring Republic of Moldova, he stressed: \"When the temperature is below zero outside, and tens of millions of people are left without heat and water as a result of Russian missiles hitting energy facilities, this is an obvious crime against humanity.\"\n\n\"There are representatives of a State among you that offers nothing to the world except terror, destabilization and disinformation,\" he said, stressing: \"It is time to support the Ukrainian formula for peace. There must be no opportunity left for terror in the world.\" Ukraine is therefore turning to its partners for support to protect its skies and is in need of modern and effective air defence and missile defence systems. The Council must take concrete steps to protect humanity and life. Although the Russian Federation has been trying to turn the 15-member organ into \"a platform for rhetoric and manipulation\", that Council was created as the worlds most powerful platform for decisions and actions. Calling on the Council to provide a clear assessment of the actions of the Russian Federation, he urged it to consider a resolution condemning any form of energy terror, adding: \"Lets see if anyone in the world, along with Russia, can say terror against civilians is a good thing.\"\n\nHe went on to confirm his countrys invitation to United Nations experts to examine critical infrastructure that has been or may be hit by Russian missiles, underscoring the need for a proper assessment of the damage and destruction, and for justice to be restored within the United Nations. It is a \"dead-end\" for the party responsible for terror to block any attempt by the Council to carry out its mandate, he said, pointing out that the right of veto is reserved for the Council member waging a criminal war. \"The world should not be held hostage by one international terrorist,\" he stated. Noting that the Russian Federation is trying to make the electric generator \"a more powerful and necessary tool than the United Nations Charter\", he called on the Council to offer solutions and to restore meaning to the Charter.\n\nLINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD ( United States ), observing that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems determined to reduce Ukraines energy facilities to rubble, stated that he is \"weaponizing winter\" to inflict immense suffering on Ukraines people. If he cannot seize the country by force, he will try to \"freeze the country into submission\", she added. However, if that happens, millions will be left without power, water and heat during the cold winter months. Having struggled on the battlefield, Moscow is now adopting a cowardly, inhumane strategy that punishes Ukrainian men, women and children a shameful escalation in the Russian Federations already unjustifiable war. Underscoring that the catastrophic scale and cruelty of Russian attacks cannot be overstated, she stressed that there must be a mechanism for accountability and that the international community must do everything in its power to support Ukraines people. For its part, the United States has contributed over $250 million in winterization-specific humanitarian assistance that will help provide heating supplies, blankets, shelter-repair materials and generators. Further, it pledged an additional $4.5 billion on 22 November to help Ukraine keep its schools, hospitals, utilities and emergency services running and, today, announced an additional $400 million to help Ukraines military resist Moscows attacks. Adding that President Putin seems to think his \"campaign of brutality\" will weaken the resolve of Ukraines people, she stressed that \"he is, once again, gravely mistaken\", as the Ukrainian people will not be deterred \"no matter the cold and dark that Putin tries to inflict\".\n\nARIAN SPASSE ( Albania ) pointed out that it has become a pattern that when the Russian Federation feels it is losing ground, it resorts to targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. It may use whatever camouflaged language as it has done in the past, but it is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. The European Parliaments landmark resolution confirmed this, recognizing the Russian Federation as a State-sponsor of terrorism and as a State that \"uses means of terrorism\". The terrible reality is that a Councils permanent member has descended so low that the most prominent house of democracy the European Parliament has qualified it as a sponsor of terrorism. As the unjust war continues, the risk of catastrophic spillover effects are real, as demonstrated by the blackouts across the Republic of Moldova. The more successful Ukraine proves, the angrier the punishing response, including attacks on its energy infrastructure in an effort to \"submit Ukraine by freezing the population to death\". The international community has made a clear choice by condemning the Russian Federations aggression and supporting Ukraine politically, militarily, and economically. The cause and root lie solely with the Russian Federations aggression, he said, reiterating his call to that country to stop, withdraw and engage in diplomacy.\n\nMONA JUUL ( Norway ), noting that she heard Ukraines President \"loud and clear\", reiterated her countrys unwavering support. The recent waves of attacks against Ukraine clearly demonstrate, once again, the Russian Federations complete disregard for the horrible suffering of millions. Such attacks increase humanitarian harm, serve no military purpose, aim to terrorize Ukraines population, are illegal and may constitute war crimes. Those responsible must be held to account. Turning to the concerning situation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, she voiced her support for IAEAs efforts to establish a protection zone. \"The war against Ukraine is a tragedy for individuals, Ukrainian society and its people for generations to come. It also has serious global ramifications,\" she emphasized, before welcoming the renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. She also repeated her call for the Russian Federation to immediately cease its unlawful and senseless aggression. Humanitarian organizations must have safe, rapid and unimpeded access to people in need; all civilians must be protected; and international humanitarian law and international human rights law must be fully respected and implemented, she emphasized.\n\nNICOLAS DE RIVIRE ( France ) strongly condemned the ongoing strikes on civilian targets, saying that every time Ukraine achieves a military victory, the Russian Federation responds with new attacks on essential infrastructure. Such retaliatory strikes are intolerable, he said. France will continue to support Ukraine, including by organizing an international conference on 13 December to set up a mechanism to coordinate international assistance for the Ukrainian people. It will also support the Republic of Moldova, he said, noting that the recent third meeting of the Moldova Support Platform, held in Paris, raised 100 million.\n\nRONALDO COSTA FILHO ( Brazil ) reaffirmed that attacks against civilian targets, including energy and transport infrastructure, are unjustifiable and violate international law and international humanitarian law. The parties must suspend hostilities immediately to avoid a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation. He also noted with concern the announced deployment of air defence systems in Poland close to the Ukraine border. It is necessary to act responsibly and to prevent at all costs the conflict from taking even greater proportions. As important as it is to condemn the violations committed during this crisis, such statements are irrelevant to civilians who, on both sides of the front line, aspire for peace, he said.\n\nJAMES KARIUKI ( United Kingdom ) said that the Russian Federation is trying to achieve with terror and murder what it could not achieve on the battlefield, namely the complete subjugation or destruction of Ukraine. The Russian Federation must observe its obligations under international humanitarian law, he said, noting that the President of Ukraine has presented a comprehensive plan for a negotiated end to war. The first crucial steps are for the Russian Federation to end its unilateral aggression and to restore Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity, in line with its obligations under the United Nations Charter. He added that United Kingdom will be providing new air defence equipment and stepping up humanitarian support for Ukraine for the cold, hard winter ahead.\n\nCIT MORAN ( Ireland ), noting that rolling blackouts have become the new normal in Ukraine and that today much of the neighbouring Republic of Moldova is without power, condemned the Russian Federations use of energy as \"a weapon of war\". Citing the report of a Russian rocket attack on a maternity ward in a southern Ukrainian hospital that killed a newborn baby, she further noted that in Kyiv three people were killed as a result of Russian shelling and highlighted recent reports of torture chambers uncovered in Kherson. These attacks have achieved nothing beyond terrorizing and punishing the civilian population. Further, attacks targeting civilians and civilian objects are war crimes, she stressed, adding: \"Russias use of explosive weapons in populated areas is grossly disturbing.\" In that regard, she highlighted the \"Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians\", which 83 countries adopted in Dublin last week. She called for parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law, including obligations against attacks that do not distinguish between military targets and civilians, among others. \"This is all the more urgent as millions of people across Ukraine enter into a dark and freezing winter at the hands of the Russian Federation,\" she emphasized. Noting that the Russian Federation \"continues along its path of escalation, death and destruction\", she called on that country to cease all hostilities, withdraw its troops and return to diplomacy.\n\nLANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH ( United Arab Emirates ) expressed deep alarm that the recent reported missile strikes across Ukraine have caused an increase in rolling blackouts, cuts to water supplies and significant power outages to the extent that they have affected neighbouring Republic of Moldova. She also expressed concern about reports that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was subject to renewed shelling over the weekend and echoed calls for a concerted effort by parties to avert a nuclear disaster. \"It is completely unacceptable that the people of the region, and indeed the world, should live under constant threat,\" she said. With the damage and destruction extending beyond Ukraines power plants and electricity grid, she urged parties to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure. The current situation is yet another reminder of the urgent need for a cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of this war. Noting last weeks positive development regarding the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative to create the necessary momentum towards broader talks, she said the Council must rise to the occasion by showing unity around the path forward to resolving this conflict.\n\nJUAN RAMN DE LA FUENTE RAMREZ ( Mexico ), warning that a nuclear accident would have unacceptable humanitarian and environmental consequences, called for a security perimeter to be urgently established around the Zaporizhzhia power plant. He also noted that the Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols state unambiguously that civilian objects cannot be targeted. Underscoring the wars impact on food prices and its effect on food security in many countries, he welcomed the renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative as well as the memorandum of understanding between the Russian Federation and the United Nations Secretariat to facilitate market access for food and fertilizers.\n\nLILLY STELLA NGYEMA NDONG ( Gabon ) called once again on the parties to find a political solution and escape from the logic of belligerence. There is no possible solution other than dialogue, she said, adding that to prolong the war is to toy with the lives of thousands of civilians who are being exposed to indiscriminate attacks, including those on civilian infrastructure. Interrupting electricity for millions of Ukrainians will worsen the humanitarian situation and exacerbate suffering as winter approaches, she warned.\n\nMICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO ( Kenya ), warning that \"we cannot overstress the need to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure from attacks\", called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. Dialogue and diplomacy must be given a chance. Noting the roll-over of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the agreement to ensure the unimpeded export of Russian food and fertilizer, he called for political assurances to ensure unimpeded deliveries to countries in need, especially those in Africa. He added that the Secretary-General and his good offices must be leveraged further to bring the war to an end. For its part, the Council must explore all options that can lead to the wars cessation followed by a dialogue for a political solution that guarantees Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity, addresses underlying grievances and secures a stable European security order, he said.\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ) expressed concern that the conflict in Ukraine has led to constant attacks on civilian facilities and a steady rise of civilian casualties and displaced persons. \"There is no winner in the conflict and the war, and dialogue and negotiations are the only way forward.\" China calls once again on the parties concerned to show restraint, avoid actions that exacerbate confrontation, and prevent complications from spiraling out of control. The international community must focus on helping Ukraine repair its damaged energy infrastructure, provide supplies to the affected population, meet the basic needs of refugees and displaced persons, and help people properly resettle and survive this winter. He called on all parties concerned to act with prudence, make every effort to ensure the safety of nuclear facilities and avoid man-made nuclear accidents. China further welcomed the agreement reached by the parties concerning the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, he said.\n\nVASSILY NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ), regarding President Zelenskyys participation in todays meeting, reiterated that his country is not opposed to such participation. Rather, it should be in-person, as required by the rules that have guided the Councils work for more than 75 years. Addressing Norways representative, he said that, while she heard President Zelenskyy \"loud and clear\", that President did not hear her as he is not interested in the views of Council members; rather, he simply wants a platform on which to speak. Over the course of its special military operation, the Russian Federation has had to deal not only with the Kyiv regimes units, but also the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), who are providing various military support while \"conducting a proxy war with Russia\". Thus, to weaken and destroy the military potential of its opponents, Moscow has conducted precision strikes against energy and other infrastructure used to supply Ukrainian units armed with Western weapons. Noting that many members today expressed outrage that Ukrainian citizens may find themselves without light or water, he said that the West displayed no such concern when the inhabitants of Crimea found themselves in such a situation due to Ukraines actions in 2015. \"Not to mention the Donbas, which saw its economic lifeline snuffed out for eight years,\" he added.\n\nHe stressed that the Wests reckless flow of weapons to Ukraine has already killed peaceful inhabitants in the Donbas and Ukrainian cities. Kyivs propaganda attempts to carefully conceal this in its attempts to reduce everything to the Russian Federations fault. Moscow is carefully recording all evidence of crimes committed by Ukrainian military units, \"including on the territory of Russian regions temporarily under their control\", he noted. Detailing purges, repression, torture, execution and other atrocities committed by the Ukrainian military, he said that his country expects the international community and international human-rights organizations to condemn Kyiv for its failure to comply with international humanitarian law. The Russian Federation is conducting strikes against infrastructure in response to the \"unbridled\" flow of weapons into Ukraine and Kyivs reckless appeals to defeat the Russian Federation. Weakening Ukraines military capacity is one of the special military operations goals, and this will continue by military means until the Kyiv regime adopts a \"realistic position\", he stated. In the meantime, what the world is hearing from President Zelenskyy and his supporters is not a readiness to achieve peace; rather, it is the language of reckless threats and ultimatums. Western countries have encouraged this approach, and \"war to the last Ukrainian\" allows their military-industrial complex to make huge profits and test NATO armaments. He stressed that, in this way, Western countries are trying to \"consolidate their geopolitical hegemony using the bodies and lives of ordinary Ukrainians\".\n\nRUCHIRA KAMBOJ ( India ) expressed regret that history has shown that killing civilians and devastating civilian infrastructure have been used as legitimate weapons of war. She strongly condemned the use of oppressive violence against innocent civilians and the targeting of civilian objects in armed conflict, regardless of who commits them. Her country consistently called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, an end to the violence, and for both sides to return to the path of diplomacy and dialogue, she said, reiterating her Prime Ministers statement that this cannot be an era of war. Indias people-centric approach encompasses providing both humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and economic support to some in the Global South under economic distress due to the conflicts ripple effects. It also provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia, financial aid for educational reconstruction, at the request of Ukraine, and exported 1.8 million tons of wheat to help low-income countries fight against price rises and foodstuff shortages. She expressed her sincere hope for an early resumption of the peace talks to bring about an immediate ceasefire and early resolution of the conflict.\n\nHAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN ( Ghana ), Council President for November, spoke in his national capacity, saying that the painful reality, made evident with each Council briefing, is that civilians are paying the highest price and will continue to suffer unless the war ends immediately. Urging the collective support of the Council to bring relief to Ukraines people, he also called on all parties to exercise restraint and ensure compliance with the IAEAs seven pillars of nuclear safety. All warring sides must fully comply with their obligations under international law and international humanitarian law as well as with the prohibitions against direct attacks on civilian infrastructure. He then stressed the importance of thorough, transparent and independent investigations into all claims of human rights violations and possible war crimes. The Russian Federation must immediately withdraw its forces from Ukraine, he reiterated. For its part, the Council must unify its efforts towards the immediate cessation of hostilities and further diplomacy to restore peace, he said.\n\nCORNEL FERU ( Romania ) stressed that the humanitarian situation has been dire for the past almost nine months but is now further deteriorating, with the civilian population enduring missiles or brutal unmanned aerial vehicle attacks in areas of limited military significance intentionally targeting critical civilian infrastructure. It is now night in Ukraine and many civilians do not have access to proper heating or electricity; the lives of many millions are at risk. Recent attacks also affected the electricity interconnection between Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and the European electricity grid. In the Republic of Moldova, these attacks led to a complete blackout today, and for the past month, Romania has been supplying between 80 and 90 per cent of that countrys electricity needs.\n\nLast week, the General Assembly decisively stated that Moscow must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making full reparations, with the need to establish an international mechanism for reparation for damage, loss or injury, he continued. All victims of the Russian Federations aggression deserve justice and reparation, he stressed. Welcoming the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative beyond 19 November, he noted that Romania is making its own grain available to partners around the world, will continue to help facilitate Ukrainian exports, and has inaugurated a new border crossing point between the two countries to ensure better connectivity and diversify export routes. With his country sharing the largest land border with Ukraine, he noted more than 8.5 million tons of grain and other food products were exported via Romania.\n\nGHEORGHE LEUC ( Republic of Moldova ) condemned the Russian Federations war against Ukraine and its recent attack on civilians and civilian infrastructure. For more than nine months now, his countrys neighbour has been defending its freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity from an unprovoked war of aggression. This aggression has triggered the largest humanitarian refugee crisis in Europe, prompted global food shortages, caused economic downturns and has deepened the continents energy crisis. Further, this brutal war continues to cause unforeseen human losses and the significant destruction of civilian and energy infrastructure which only worsens the overall humanitarian situation, he noted, expressing additional concern over the forthcoming winter period.\n\nThe spillover effects of the war against Ukraine are being felt increasingly in neighbouring countries, including in his country, he stressed. The continued attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure have left the Republic of Moldova in darkness. During the similar incident on 15 November, more than 50 per cent of the country was without electricity and had its water supply affected. Todays event left the Republic of Moldova with severely disrupted and unavailable power, water supply, internet and mobile phone connection services. Reminding the Council of the missile debris which landed in a northern village on the border of Ukraine, he said such incidents demonstrate one thing: the war should stop now to avoid catastrophic humanitarian consequences. As such, the Russian Federation must immediately cease its military aggression, withdraw its forces form Ukraines sovereign territory, fully comply with its international law obligations and uphold human rights. Standing in solidarity to defend the values of freedom, liberty and democracy, he reaffirmed his countrys unwavering support to Ukraines independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.",

The UK is also contributing money.\n\nHow have nuclear plants been affected?\n\nThree nuclear power plants were disconnected from the grid for two days because of air strikes.\n\nUN experts are also worried that shelling around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the largest in Europe - might cause a radioactive leak.\n\nShells have fallen near reactors and have hit a radioactive waste storage building at the plant but have not yet caused serious damage.\n\nUkraine and Russia blame each other for the shelling.\n\nWhy is Russia targeting the power system?\n\nAttacks on power infrastructure aim to damage the morale of Ukraine's civilian population, says Marina Miron, defence researcher at King's College London.\n\n\"Russia thinks that if people are freezing and desperate, they may revolt against their government,\" she says.\n\nHowever Olena Zelenska told BBC News Ukrainians were prepared to cope without electricity if it led to their country being independent and there was a prospect of joining the European Union.\n\nUkraine's government is urging civilians to evacuate some areas where facilities such as power stations have been particularly badly hit, rather than try and live through the winter there.\n\nIt is advising people living in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, in the south-west of Ukraine, to go to western and central areas of the country.\n\nHow have Russian attacks damaged health services?\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says that it has recorded 703 attacks, or threatened attacks, on health facilities in Ukraine since Russia first invaded in February.\n\nHundreds of hospitals and healthcare facilities are \"no longer fully operational, lacking fuel, water and electricity to meet basic needs,\" says Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe.

Over the weekend, the plant was damaged by heavy shelling and on Wednesday it was forced to go into \"full blackout mode\" due to continued Russian missile strikes.\n\n\"The latest incident at the ZNPP highlights the increasingly precarious and challenging nuclear safety and security situation at Europe's largest nuclear power plant, coming just a few days after it was repeatedly shelled,\" Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said.\n\nGrossi also underscored the need for an off-site power supply to nuclear sites as one of the seven indispensable pillars for nuclear safety during armed conflicts, which Grossi outlined earlier this year. The plant is currently operating as if off-site power has been lost, relying on diesel generators.\n\n\"Reactors need power for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions also when they are in shutdown mode and do not produce electricity anymore,\" the IAEA said in a statement. \"In the case of an external power loss, they have emergency diesel generators that can provide back-up electricity for a limited period of time, at least for 10 days in the case of the ZNPP.\"\n\nGrossi met a Russian delegation led by the Alexey Likhachev, director general of the Russian nuclear agency, Rosatom, in Istanbul earlier on Wednesday.

He lamented that \"Washington has been abusing 'loudspeaker diplomacy' instead of a quiet one, which didn't help us to do business.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Briner began serving a nine-year sentence for drug possession at a Russian penal colony in Mordovia, about 350 kilometers east of Moscow, after a Russian court had rejected her appeal of her August's conviction.\n\nWhelan is serving a 16-year sentence in Russia after being convicted on espionage charges that he denied.\n\n9:10 p.m.: A first shipment of Russian fertilizer left the Netherlands on Tuesday bound for Malawi after days of wrangling to ensure it was not snagged by Western sanctions, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nDutch and U.N. customs officials said some 20,000 metric tons of nitrogen phosphorus potassium (NPK) left on board the MV Greenwich from the southern Dutch port of Terneuzen on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe ship was chartered by the U.N.'s food security agency, the World Food Program (WFP).\n\nThe shipment is the first of about 260,000 metric tons of Russian fertilizer stored in ports around Europe, which the U.N. said would help prevent \"catastrophic crop loss in Africa\" where the planting season was underway.\n\nThe shipment \"is the first of a series of shipments of fertilizer destined for a number of other countries on the African continent in the coming months,\" the U.N. said in a statement issued in New York.\n\nA second batch of fertilizer should head to West Africa, the U.N. said on Friday.\n\n8 p.m.:\n\n7:20 p.m.: The United States and NATO allies on Tuesday promised more arms for Kyiv and equipment to help restore Ukrainian power and heat knocked out by Russian missile and drone strikes, as air raid sirens blared across Ukraine for the first time this week, Reuters reported.\n\nForeign ministers from the NATO alliance, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, began a two-day meeting in Bucharest, seeking ways both to keep Ukrainians safe and warm and to sustain Kyiv's military through a coming winter campaign.\n\n\"We need air defense, IRIS, Hawks, Patriots, and we need transformers (for our energy needs),\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters on the sidelines of the NATO meeting, enumerating various Western air defense systems.\n\n\"If we have transformers and generators, we can restore our energy needs. If we have air defense systems, we can protect from the next Russian missile strikes. In a nutshell: Patriots and transformers are what Ukraine needs the most.\"\n\n6:29 p.m.: Germany will provide Ukraine with more than 350 generators, a government spokesman said Tuesday, after Russian missile strikes severely damaged Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and said Germany would dispatch the generators, as well as provide financial assistance to repair energy infrastructure worth $57 million, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said.\n\n5:42 p.m.:\n\n5 p.m.: The son of a Russian businessman close to President Vladimir Putin denied any wrongdoing as his trial started in northern Norway, where he is accused of violating a law that bars Russians from flying drones, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nAndrei Yakunin, who holds both Russian and British passports, was arrested on October 17 after he had sailed around the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard and along the coast of Norway.\n\nThe 47-year-old had been filming with the drone while mountaineering, glacier walking, and sailing, according to his lawyer, John Christian Elden, who has said that Yakunin should be considered a British citizen, rather than Russian.\n\n4:06 p.m.: Ukraine has detained a deputy head of newly liberated Kherson's city council on suspicion of aiding and abetting Russian occupation forces that seized control of the city in March, Reuters quoted Ukraine's state prosecutor as saying.\n\nThe Kherson official, who was not named in the statement, cooperated with the occupation authorities and helped with the functioning of public services under the Russians, the prosecutor said.\n\nUkraine faces a challenge restoring order in Kherson.

Crews operating one in a muddy field in the Donetsk region say the key to its success is its targeting precision. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n1:35 p.m.: Reuters reports that Ukrainian soldiers face a new adversary: muddy trenches.\n\nSquelching through thick mud on Tuesday, Petro, a Ukrainian soldier dug in not far from Russian positions in the Donbas, recounted matter-of-factly how his unit had to use buckets to clear out water-logged trenches.\n\n\"We're more or less okay, but it's bit harder now because of the rain and a light frost. It's a swamp. It's dried a bit today...,\" the 35-year-old said, warming up in a dugout near the trenches.\n\nHeavy rain and falling temperatures are making conditions even grimmer along the frontlines, where tens of thousands of Ukrainians and Russians are facing off as the war, now in its 10th month, grinds into winter.\n\n1:05 p.m.:\n\n12:55 p.m.: A court in Moscow on Tuesday opened the trial of a prominent Russian opposition figure who faces charges stemming from his criticism of the Kremlins action in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nIlya Yashin, one of the few Kremlin critics to have remained in the country amid an intensifying crackdown on dissent, has been in custody since his arrest in July.\n\nHe was charged with spreading false information about the military a new offense added to the contrys criminal law after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine. Yashin faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe charges against Yashin relate to a YouTube livestream video in which he talked about Ukrainians being killed in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. He rejects the charges as politically motivated.\n\n12:40 p.m.:\n\n12:25 p.m.: Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said on Tuesday that a Zambian student who died in Ukraine had been fighting for his Wagner Private Military Group, Reuters reported.\n\nRussia previously notified Zambia that Lemekhani Nyirenda had been killed on the battlefield in Ukraine in September, prompting Zambia to ask Moscow for more details and an explanation of how he had ended up fighting in the war.\n\nNyirenda's father said he had been serving a nine-year jail sentence on the outskirts of Moscow for a drug offence when he was \"conscripted\" to fight. His family said it was unclear how he was recruited or by whom.\n\nOn Tuesday, Prigozhin's Concord catering group said Nyirenda had been recruited by Wagner.

We do not have any dialogue with the United States on the Ukraine topic because our positions are radically different,\" Ryabkov was cited as saying.\n\n11:45 a.m.:\n\n11:40 a.m.: The Group of Seven wealthy democracies (G7) agreed on Tuesday to set up a network to coordinate investigations into war crimes, as part of a push to prosecute suspected atrocities in Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Judicial examination of the atrocities committed in Ukraine will take years, perhaps even decades. But we will be well prepared and we will persist for as long as it takes,\" German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann said in a statement.\n\n11:35 a.m.:\n\n11:20 a.m.: The United States on Tuesday announced $53 million to support the purchase of power grid equipment to Ukraine to help Kyiv fight Russian attacks targeting its energy infrastructure that left millions in the dark with no heating, Reuters reported.\n\n\"This equipment will be rapidly delivered to Ukraine on an emergency basis to help Ukrainians persevere through the winter,\" a State Department statement said, adding that the package would include distribution transformers, circuit breakers, surge arresters among other equipment.\n\nRussia has been carrying out huge attacks on Ukraine's electricity transmission and heating infrastructure roughly weekly since October, in what Kyiv and its allies say is a deliberate campaign to harm civilians, a war crime.\n\n11:05 a.m.: Living without heat, power, fuel, or water in apartment buildings damaged by Russian shells, residents of the Ukrainian frontline city of Bakhmut get a lifeline from volunteers delivering small wood-burning stoves. Others have organized online sites for obtaining kindling and logs for the fires -- but even these supplies won't help some at-risk residents, who must be evacuated before winter arrives. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n10:45 a.m.: An uneasy calm hung over Kyiv on Tuesday as residents of the Ukrainian capital did what they could to prepare for anticipated Russian missile attacks aiming to take out more energy infrastructure as winter sets in, The Associated Press reported.\n\nTo ease that burden, NATO allies made plans to boost provisions of blankets, generators and other basic necessities to ensure Ukraines 43 million people can maintain their resolve in the 10th month of fighting against Russias invasion.\n\nUkraines first lady implored the West to show the same kind of steadfastness that Ukrainians had shown against Russian President Vladimir Putins military campaign.\n\n\"Ukrainians are very tired of this war, but we have no choice in the matter,\" Olena Zelenska, the wife of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a BBC interview during a visit to Britain.\n\n\"We do hope that the approaching season of Christmas doesnt make you forget about our tragedy and get used to our suffering,\" she said.\n\n10:30 a.m.:\n\n10:15 a.m.: Italy's ruling rightist parties are preparing to vote on allowing the government to continue sending weapons to Ukraine throughout 2023, a draft amendment and a parliamentary motion seen by Reuters showed on Tuesday.\n\nThe proposal, still subject to approval, is under discussion at the upper-house Senate and would amend a decree passed earlier this month by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government.\n\nIt would extend the authorization to send \"military assets, materials and equipment\" until December 31, 2023. Lawmakers will discuss the decree on Tuesday, but it was not clear when a vote would take place.\n\nTogether the amendment and the decree would allow the government to send more arms supplies to Kyiv if and when it sees fit, without seeking parliamentary authorization for each shipment.\n\n10:00 a.m.:\n\n9:50 a.m.: Moscow said on Tuesday it had been left with \"no other choice\" but to cancel talks with the United States about the \"New START\" nuclear weapons control treaty, Russian state-run news agencies reported, according to Reuters.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Washington had only wanted to discuss resuming inspections while Moscow had other priorities.\n\nThe situation in Ukraine also played a part in Russia's last-minute decision to scrap the meeting of the bilateral commission, which had been due to begin in Cairo on Tuesday.\n\n9:35 a.m.:\n\n9:20 a.m.: The U.S. State Department has approved a second significant arms sale to Finland within a month, helping Russia's Nordic neighbor in its bid to strengthen its defenses due to the war in Ukraine, Finland and the United States said, according to Reuters.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Finland's government decided to grant an additional 1.7 billion euros ($1.76 billion) to arms and other defense material purchases this year alone.\n\n\"A very significant share of it will go to (purchases) from the U.S.,\" Governmental Counsellor Iikka Marttila from Finland's Defence Ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nThe State Department said the proposed sale of AIM 9X Block II tactical missiles, AGM-154 Joint Stand Off weapons and related equipment, for an estimated $323.3 million, would improve Finlands air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons capabilities.\n\n9:05 a.m.:\n\n8:50 a.m.: U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland is scheduled to travel to Poland November 30 to December 1, to attend the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Foreign Ministers Meeting, the State Department said Tuesday.\n\n\"Under Secretary Nuland will reiterate the United States commitment to the OSCEs foundational principles to advance security, prosperity, human rights, and territorial integrity particularly in the face of Russias war on Ukraine,\" it said.\n\n\"Under Secretary Nuland will also meet with Polish officials to thank Poland for its leadership as OSCE chair and underscore the U.S. commitment to NATOs Eastern Flank,\" according to the statement.\n\n8:30 a.m.:\n\n8:05 a.m.: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg reaffirmed the military alliances commitment to Ukraine on Tuesday, saying that the war-torn nation will one day become a member of the worlds largest security organization, The Associated Press reported.\n\nStoltenbergs remarks came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his NATO counterparts gathered in Romania to drum up urgently needed support for Ukraine aimed at ensuring that Moscow fails to defeat the country as it bombards energy infrastructure.\n\n\"NATOs door is open,\" Stoltenberg said. \"Russia does not have a veto\" on countries joining, he said in reference to the recent entry of North Macedonia and Montenegro into the security alliance. He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"will get Finland and Sweden as NATO members\" soon. The Nordic neighbors applied for membership in April, concerned that Russia might target them next.\n\nIn essence, Stoltenberg repeated a vow made by NATO leaders in Bucharest in 2008 in the same sprawling Palace of the Parliament where the foreign ministers are meeting this week that Ukraine, and also Georgia, would join the alliance one day.\n\nEven so, Ukraine will not join NATO anytime soon. Many of NATOs 30 allies believe the focus now must solely be on defeating Russia, and Stoltenberg stressed that any attempt to move ahead on membership could divide them.\n\n7:45 a.m.:\n\n7:15 a.m.: Air raid sirens wailed across Ukraine on Tuesday for the first time this week, as the United States and NATO allies unveiled new pledges of money and equipment to help restore power and heat knocked out by Moscow's missile and drone strikes, Reuters reported.\n\nUkrainians fled the streets for bomb shelters, although there were no immediate reports of major attacks away from the front. The all-clear was later sounded in the capital Kyiv, but officials said the threat had not necessarily lifted.\n\nForeign ministers from the NATO alliance were starting a two-day meeting in Bucharest, looking for ways both to keep millions of Ukrainian civilians safe and warm, and to sustain Kyiv's military through the coming winter campaign.\n\n\"NATO will continue to stand for Ukraine as long as it takes. We will not back down,\" alliance General-Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said in a speech in Bucharest.\n\nHe told reporters Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"trying to use winter as a weapon of war\" as Moscow's forces lose on the battlefield, and that Western allies would step in to help.\n\n6:35 a.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Romanian officials Tuesday ahead of a conference of NATO foreign ministers in Bucharest which is focused on the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe State Department released Blinkens remarks following his meeting with Romanias Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca, and a statement regarding Blinkens meeting with Romanias President Klaus Iohannis.\n\nAdditionally, Blinken tweeted about his meeting with Romanias Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu.\n\n6:15 a.m.: Sweden is on track to meet Turkey's requirements for accepting it and Finland as new members of NATO, Reuters reported Tuesday quoting Sweden's foreign minister Tobias Billstrom.\n\n\"We are on a steady path to meet Turkey's conditions,\" he said before a meeting with colleagues from NATO countries.

Generally, the cruelest are perhaps those who are of Russia but are not of the Russian tradition, such as the Chechens, the Buryati and so on. Certainly, the one who invades is the Russian state. This is very clear.\"\n\n5:05 a.m.: In the past several weeks, Ukraine has rolled out hundreds of \"Points of Invincibility\" government-built help stations that offer food, drink and heat to thousands of Ukrainians.\n\nIn its report, The Associated Press spoke with a few of the 67,000 Ukrainians that these nearly 1,000 centers have helped.\n\n4:30 a.m.: China is willing to forge a closer partnership with Russia on energy issues to ensure global energy security, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, as the G-7 grouping of nations prepares to impose new measures on Russia's oil exports.\n\nReuters reported Xi's comments Tuesday, citing state broadcaster CCTV which carried the message made to the Fourth China-Russia energy forum.\n\n\"China is willing to work with Russia to forge a closer energy partnership, promote clean and green energy development and jointly maintain international energy security and the stability of industry supply chains,\" CCTV quoted the message as saying.\n\nThe meeting of businesses from the two trade partners comes amid preparations for a G-7 price cap to be imposed from December 5 on Russian oil, in efforts to curb Moscow's ability to fund its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n4 a.m.: Dozens of modern artworks removed from Kyiv to protect them from Russian strikes that have already done huge damage to Ukraine's cultural heritage will go on display at a Madrid museum on Tuesday.\n\nThe works on show at the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum of Art as part of the \"In the Eye of the Storm: Modernism in Ukraine 1900-1930\" exhibition include oil paintings, sketches and collages.\n\nAgence France-Presse reported that the Madrid exhibition is one of a number of showings of Ukraine's cultural heritage across Europe, as well as an effort to raise awareness of the threat posed to the war-torn country's artistic legacy as fighting grinds on.\n\n3:43 a.m.: Qatar has agreed to send Germany two million tons of liquefied natural gas a year for at least 15 years, officials said Tuesday, as Europe's biggest economy scrambles for alternative supplies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nWith the deal, Qatar aims to \"contribute to efforts to support energy security in Germany and Europe\" said Saad Sherida al-Kaabi, Qatar's energy minister and CEO of QatarEnergy.\n\n3 a.m.: The Associated Press reported that Ukrainian police are investigating suspected torture sites in the formerly occupied city of Kherson. Police said five such rooms have been found in the city and four more in the surrounding area since the Russian retreat more than two weeks ago.\n\n2:30 a.m.: More than 146,000 have fled to the U.K. under a scheme that offers Ukrainians the opportunity to live, work and study for up to three years with access to state benefits. The scheme relies on goodwill from ordinary people.\n\nIn this Agence France-Presse story, Ukrainians hosted in the U.K. share their struggle to find housing.\n\n2:10 a.m.:\n\n2 a.m.: The pace of global shipping activity is set to lose steam next year as economic turmoil, conflict in Ukraine and the impact of the pandemic weaken the outlook for trade, Reuters reported Tuesday citing U.N. agency UNCTAD.\n\nThe world's largest investment banks expect global economic growth to slow further in 2023 following a year roiled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and soaring inflation. The slowdown is expected to impact shipping, which transports more than 80% of global trade, although tanker freight rates could stay high.\n\n\"The recovery in maritime transport and logistics is now at risk from the war in Ukraine, the continued grip of the pandemic, lingering supply-chain constraints, and Chinas cooling economy and zero-COVID policy, along with inflationary pressures and the cost-of-living squeeze,\" UNCTAD said in the report.\n\nUNCTAD called for investment in maritime supply chains to enable ports, shipping fleets and hinterland connections to be better prepared for future global crises, climate change and the transition to low-carbon energy.\n\n1:33 a.m.: NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg will call on allies to pledge more winter aid for Kyiv at a meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, after Ukraine's president told residents to brace for another week of cold and darkness due to Russian attacks on infrastructure.\n\nReuters reported that the NATO foreign ministers meeting in Bucharest will focus on ramping up military assistance for Ukraine such as air defense systems and ammunition, even as diplomats acknowledge supply and capacity issues, but also discuss non-lethal aid as well.\n\nPart of this non-lethal aid goods such as fuel, medical supplies, winter equipment and drone jammers has been delivered through a NATO assistance package that allies can contribute to and which Stoltenberg aims to increase.\n\n1 a.m.: The United States will announce new aid on Tuesday to help Ukraine restore electricity as its people faced another week of brutal cold and darkness after Russian missile strikes on its power grid caused rolling blackouts, Reuters reported.\n\nRussia has targeted Ukraine's power plants, transmission and distribution facilities and water pumping stations since early October, with each barrage having greater impact than the last as damage accumulates and winter sets in.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he expects new attacks that could be as bad as last week's bombardment, which left millions of people with no heat, water or power.\n\n12:45 a.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Bucharest ahead of Tuesdays NATO Foreign Ministers meeting.\n\nThe meeting, hosted for the first time by Romania, will focus on the war in Ukraine and how to protect critical civilian infrastructure, among other topics, The Associated Press reported.\n\n12:05 a.m.: Ukrainian energy company Naftogaz has asked the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, to help with additional natural gas volumes for the heating season, Oleksiy Chernyshov, Reuters reported quoting the company's chief executive.\n\nRussia has been carrying out massive missile bombardments on Ukraine's energy and power infrastructure roughly weekly since early October, with each barrage having greater impact than the last as damage accumulates and a frigid winter sets in.\n\nSnow has been falling for a couple of days in a row in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, a city that had 2.8 million residents before the war, as people struggle with disruptions to electricity supply and central heating.\n\n\"The key is the additional volume of gas needed to get through this heating season,\" Chernyshov wrote on his Facebook page after a meeting with Elizabeth McKee, the assistant administrator of the USAID for Europe and Eurasia.\n\nChernyshov also said that his talks with McKee included sending necessary materials and equipment to Ukraine - on provision of which the Agency has already been working.\n\n\"We are talking, in particular, about methanol, gas compressors, diesel generators and equipment for gas production,\" Chernyshov said.\n\nIn October, USAID said it would invest $55 million in Ukraine's heating infrastructure to aid the country's preparations for winter, according to a statement on the Agency's website.\n\nSome information in this report came from Reuters, Agence France-Presse and The Associated Press.",

Telegram/Tvezda\n\nThe Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, commented Sunday on an incident in eastern Luhansk, saying Russian servicemen \"are those who are fighting and committing treachery\" and that \"returning fire is not a war crime.\"\n\nRussia has accused Ukraine of war crimes after video emerged on social media, which Moscow says shows Russian soldiers killed after surrendering to Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe precise details of what happened remain unclear.\n\n\"From some pieces of video about the incident with the Russian military in Luhansk region it may be concluded that using the staged surrender, the Russians committed a war crime they opened fire on the military of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,\" Lubinets said in a Telegram post on Sunday, implying that the Russians from the video may have acted as if they would surrender but did not.\n\n\"In this case, persons among the Russian servicemen cannot be considered prisoners of war, but are those who are fighting and committing treachery,\" he said. \"Returning fire is not a war crime. On the contrary, those who want to use the protection of international law to kill must be punished.\"\n\nWhat the video appears to show: The edited video purports to show captured Russian soldiers in an act of surrender, with several men lying on the ground on their fronts with their hands over their heads. More soldiers are seen emerging one by one from a building and lying down next to them in the yard.\n\nA voice apparently directing the surrender can be heard shouting: \"Come on out, one by one. Which of you is the officer? Has everyone come out? Come out!\"\n\nAfter about 10 men are down on the ground, another soldier emerges from the same building and appears to open fire in the direction of the Ukrainian soldiers conducting the surrender.\n\nA short burst of gunfire is heard before the video clip ends abruptly.\n\nA second clip filmed later from a drone above the same location shows the bodies of what appear to be the same Russian soldiers in the yard, most just a few meters from where they had been lying in the first clip.\n\nCNN has been unable to verify exactly what happened in the first video clip, and it is unclear exactly what happened in the period that elapsed between the first clip and the filming of the drone footage.\n\nThe UN investigates: Marta Hurtado, a spokesperson for the United Nations Human Rights Office, said, according to Reuters: \"We are aware of the videos and we are looking into them. Allegations of summary executions of people hors de combat should be promptly, fully and effectively investigated, and any perpetrators held to account.\"\n\nMore context: A UN panel of experts said in September that their investigation has found evidence that war crimes have been committed during Russia's war in Ukraine, including cases of rape and torture of children.",

The renewed Russian invasion in February 2022 after eight years of deadly \"ceasefire\" following the first Russian invasions of 2014 demonstrates that Russian President Vladimir Putin will not rest until he has conquered Kyiv. Ukraines resistance to the invasion this year shows that Ukrainians will not easily surrender. The conflict is unresolvable as long as Putinism rules the Kremlin. Negotiations wont change that reality. They can only create the conditions from which Putin or a Putinist successor will contemplate renewing the attack on Ukraines independence. Before pressing Ukraine to ask Russia for talks we must examine the terms Ukraine might offer Russia, the dangers of offering those terms, and, more importantly, the likelihood that Putin would accept them.\n\nWhen Putin re-invaded Ukraine in February he already had Crimea and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, and no one was realistically going to take them away from him. That was not enough for him. Offering him a return to a situation so unsatisfactory to him that he launched a massive invasion to change is not a face-saving off-ramp. Imagine Putin sitting at one end of a long table and announcing proudly to the Russian people that at the cost of more than 100,000 dead and injured Russians and nine months or more of economic devastation he has securedalmost exactly what he had before. No. Putin saves no face by doing that. He would likely accept such an outcome if the military realities of the situation required it, but he will never regard it as an attractive off ramp. The Kremlins repeated refusals even to consider negotiations along these lines are proof enough of this conclusion.\n\nFor Putin to justify accepting less than his maximalist aims in any sincere way he would have to show great gainsgains measured in the tens of thousands of square kilometers of new Ukrainian territory permanently annexed to Russia. It is far from clear that he would accept even that, to be sure, as the basis for any durable peace. But the West must be honest with itself and its people, as well as with Ukrainians. The price for \"getting Putin to the table\" with the frontlines in a configuration remotely like the one they are now in is very likely to be promising him huge swaths of Ukrainian land, not minor changes in diplomatic language surrounding what he has already shown that he found insufficient.\n\nIt is also vital to recall the fire never ceased during the so-called \"ceasefire\" between 2014 and 2022. Russian forces conducted constant military attacks on Ukrainian positions throughout that period, and Putin used the Russian military presence in Ukraine as leverage to coerce Kyiv, demand additional concessions, and drive wedges within Ukrainian politics and society and between Ukraine and the West.\n\nDiscussions about the desirability of Ukraine negotiating from a position of strength, while its forces are winning, are based on a mistaken premise. Ukraine has liberated nearly half the land Russia has seized since renewing its invasion in February 2022meaning that Russia still has more than half the territory it illegally occupies. Ukraine has momentum in this conflict, but not yet the upper hand. Its negotiating position is stronger than it was when Russian forces were advancing on additional critical cities and regions, but not yet strong enough to have created good conditions from which to negotiate.\n\nAdvocates of talks must be clear on another key pointnegotiations at this stage of the conflict will not yield additional Russian territorial concessions. Putin has announced the formal annexation to Russia of large areas of Ukraine that he does not control. He might agree to a ceasefire that informally accepts that Ukraine can have those regions, but he will not agree to one that requires him to pull back voluntarily from lands he has claimed are now part of Russia. Not at this stage of the war, as Russian reinforcements are arriving and the West is heading into a cold winter that Putin hopes will break its will to continue supporting Ukraine. Putins actions show that he does not yet believe that he has lost this war, that he will lose it, or even that he will not be able to gain more land by fighting. Russian forces are even now leaning into a renewed offensive in Donetsk Oblast. In those conditions Putin will not make a concession that will appear utterly humiliating to him of retracting his announced annexations or withdrawing his troops from areas they currently control. A ceasefire now will freeze the lines where they are at best.\n\nThat consideration is extremely important because Putins forces still occupy strategically vital areas even after Ukraines successes in western Kherson. Russia still controls the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plantthe largest in Europe and a major source of Ukrainian energy as well as an increasing danger to the environment in the irresponsible hands of the Russians. It still controls the vital hub of Melitopol, a city that sits astride essential lines of communication from Russia in the east to the lower Dnipro River in the west and from Ukrainian-held Zaporizhia Oblast to the north to Crimea in the south. If Russia retains Melitopol it will build it into a massive forward base from which to launch future invasions to take the critical Ukrainian cities of Zaporizhia and Dnipro and possibly to cross the Dnipro itself once again to put all Ukraine at risk. The current lines leave almost the entirety of Ukraines mineral extraction and processing industries in Russian hands. Those industries, concentrated in the east around Donetsk and Luhansk cities with vital transportation and processing links through Mariupol, comprised a sizable part of the pre-2014 Ukrainian economy. Giving them to Russia risks making Ukraine a permanent economic basket case dependent on the international community for long-term aid. These are not just miscellaneous Ukrainian territories somewhere in the east. They are areas Ukraine must regain to survive as an independent state facing the constant threat of renewed Russian aggression.\n\nEven conceding these lands would not end the war, moreover. Putin did not invade Ukraine to gain territory. He invaded because he rejects the idea of an independent Ukrainian state or a Ukrainian ethnicity. He attacked because he refuses to tolerate a government in Kyiv that is not under de facto Russian control. He has built these ideas deeply into his ideology and will not remove them. Putin will never stop trying to regain control of Ukraine by one means or another. Neither the Ukraine nor the West can change Putins ambitionsso they must create reality in which even Putin understands that he must not pursue them by war and in which he lacks the capability to continue fighting even if he wanted to.\n\nHow can that reality come about? The West should help Ukraine liberate the areas that are strategically vital to its security and economic well-being and then build up the Ukrainian military and economy to a point that deters future Russian invasions. Moscow will continue to pursue means short of invasion to undermine pro-Western Ukrainian governments and coerce Ukrainians to surrender their independence. Success for Ukraine and the West lies in turning this hot war into a cold war on terms that leave Ukraine strong enough to survive and ultimately win it.\n\nAdvocates of negotiations now might claim that this is precisely what they are doing. But they have judged their moment poorly. Freezing the conflict where it is now invites renewed Russian invasion sooner and badly undermines Ukraines ability to prevail in either a renewed hot war or in the new cold war.\n\nAllowing Russia to keep some or all the areas it currently holds also condemns millions of Ukrainians to the ongoing Kremlin efforts to Russify them; to identify, torture, and kill people who still give their allegiance to Kyiv; to abduct Ukrainian children and adopt them forcibly into Russian families; and to continue the ethnic cleansing campaign Putin is pursuing to eliminate the Ukrainian national identity everywhere he can.\n\nThe current lines are thus neither defensible nor acceptable. Ukraine must push on, and the West must help Kyiv create conditions on the ground that are sustainable over the long term. Ukraine must first establish the military facts on the ground that it needs to survive and only then, with the backing of its partners, turn to Russia to codify those facts in a diplomatic agreement.",

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi has repeatedly warned that a nuclear catastrophe could result if fighting in the region is not halted.\n\nRussian attacks cut off essential power to all four of Ukraine's nuclear power plants last week, forcing operators to conduct high-risk procedures.\n\n\"We must do everything we can to prevent nuclear accidents at any of these nuclear facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we already witnessing in Ukraine,\" Grossi said.\n\nOther developments\n\nFormer NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who is raising funds to replace Ukrainian ambulances destroyed by Russian shelling, arrived in Kyiv and began surveying damage to the region. \"The depravity of Russian destruction has no bounds,\" Kelly tweeted.\n\nRussian TV personality Vladimir Solovyov urged his country to institute the death penalty for soldiers who abandon their posts in Ukraine. He also grew angry on national TV when online commenters urged him to go to the frontlines.\n\nEurope is united by a desire to keep Russia from posing a security threat, and a sovereign Ukraine is crucial, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said. Orban, who has balked at sanctions aimed at Russia, last week said he would support NATO bids for Sweden and Finland next year.\n\nRepair crews across Ukraine were scrambling to restore heat, electricity and water services that were severely damaged amid a punishing barrage of Russian missiles targeting infrastructure in recent days.\n\nZelenskyy, Kyiv mayor squabble amid snow, cold, power out\n\nSnow has blanketed much of Ukraine with temperatures hovering around freezing as utility workers scramble to patch a national power system battered by repeated Russian missile and drone strikes. Ukraine power grid operator Ukrenergo said Sunday that electricity producers were supplying about 80% of demand, up from 75% the previous day.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko on Sunday rejected complaints from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that too many Kyiv residents were still without power and that insufficient centers had been set up across the city for residents of the capital to stock up on food, water, battery power and other essentials.\n\n\"Today, when everyone must work together, some political dances begin,\" Kitscho wrote on Instagram. \"In Kyiv, we are doing everything we can for the life support of the capital, for the comfort of its residents. In difficult conditions.\"\n\nPace of war, slowed by mud, could pick up as ground freezes\n\nThe pace of the war, slowed in recent days due to deteriorating weather conditions, is likely to increase starting in the next few weeks as temperatures drop and the ground freezes, a Washington-based think tank says it its most recent assessment of the war. Both sides are bogged down by mud, but falling temperatures will likely \"expedite the pace of fighting\" as mobility increases for both sides, the Institute for the Study of War says.\n\n\"It is unclear if either side is actively planning or preparing to resume major offensive or counter-offensive operations at that time, but the meteorological factors that have been hindering such operations will begin lifting,\" the assessment says.\n\nRussian leader admits military needs more doctors, equipment\n\nA prominent Russian nationalist says the Russian military doesn't have enough doctors. Leonid Slutsky, leader of the populist Liberal Democratic Party, issued a rare public admission of problems within the military while meeting with mothers of soldiers mobilized to fight in Ukraine.\n\n\"There are not enough doctors in the military units; everyone says this,\" Slutsky, chairman of the foreign relations committee in the lower house of parliament, said at the meeting in St. Petersburg. \"I cannot say they do not exist at all, but they are practically not seen there.\"\n\nSlutsky stressed that the world is watching Russia, and \"when we do not have socks, shorts, doctors, intelligence, communications, or simply care for our children, questions arise that will be very difficult to answer.\"\n\nOlga Suyetina said her son told her that the troops are underequipped.\n\n\"There are no gunsights, nothing, we have to buy them by crowdfunding,\" she said. \"They left Kharkiv, there was zero, there was not even polyethylene to cover the dugouts.\"\n\nUkraine adds businesses amid missile strikes\n\nNew businesses are opening across Ukraine despite the battering of Russian missiles. In April, 15,000 business entities were registered, and in August the number reached 23,000, the government said. More businesses opened than closed.\n\nOn Oct. 2, a Vivat bookstore opened in Kyiv and drew 1,200 visitors. Amid air raids, customers waited in line up to 40 minutes to buy books. Vivat made news in April when it conduced a book launch in a Kharkiv bomb shelter.\n\n\"By opening a bookstore in Kyiv, we wanted to show that the publishing house is alive,\" said Vivat official Yuliia Orlova.\n\nRecently liberated Kherson battered by Russian shelling\n\nThousands of Kherson residents are fleeing the southern Ukrainian city whose liberation had been celebrated weeks earlier. Kherson Gov. Yaroslav Yanushevych said Sunday that Russian forces shelled the region 54 times over the past day, killing one person and wounding two, including a child. Yanushevych, on Telegram, said Russia \"purposefully\" targeted civilian infrastructure and civilians. Residential buildings, a garage, and an educational institution were hit in Kherson, while eight nearby villages came under fire, Yanushevych says.\n\n\"Russians continue to use terror tactics,\" the governor said.\n\nPutin meets with military moms ahead of Russian Mother's Day\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin met with a group of mothers whose children are serving in the Russian military in Ukraine or have already been killed in action. Putin, addressing adressing the mothers two days before Russian Mother's Day, said he frequently speaks with troops on the front lines and that morale is good. And he paid homage to soldiers whose lives were lost.\n\n\"I can't bring myself to telling you some formal standard things related to the expression of condolences,\" he said in addressing mothers of those who died. \"But I want you to know that I personally, and the entire leadership of the country, we share your pain. We understand that nothing can replace the loss of a son, the loss of a child.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press",

The charge against him stems from his YouTube posts about alleged crimes committed by the Russian military in the Ukrainian city of Bucha. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\n5:12 p.m.:\n\n4:17 p.m.: Armenians Protest Russian Leader's Visit: Hundreds of Armenians unhappy about Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to their country gathered at two separate rallies in Yerevan on Wednesday, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nIn one of his rare recent trips abroad, Putin arrived in the Armenian capital for a summit of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) -- a Russian-dominated military bloc.\n\nOne rally was organized by the pro-Western opposition alliance National-Democratic Pole, the other by civil-society activists and attended by Ukrainian expatriates. The protesters slammed Armenia's engagement with the CSTO, arguing that it did them no service in the recent conflict with Azerbaijan.\n\n3:10 p.m.: Armenia's leader vented his frustration on Wednesday at the failure of a Russian-led security alliance to come to his country's aid in the face of what he called aggression by Azerbaijan, Reuters reported.\n\nPrime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called into question the effectiveness of the six-nation Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) in pointed opening remarks to a summit as Russian President Vladimir Putin looked on.\n\nRussia, the dominant player in the CSTO, has long been the main power broker in the south Caucasus, bordering Turkey and Iran, where Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought two major wars since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nBut as Russia struggles in its nine-month-old war in Ukraine, it risks losing influence in parts of the former Soviet Union that it has long seen as its sphere of influence.\n\n2:29 p.m.: Ukraines Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) once again lost access to external electricity and \"is instead relying on its emergency diesel generators for the power it needs for reactor cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions,\" Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement Wednesday, using information provided by the IAEA staff on the site.\n\nThe statement continued: \"Also today, Ukraines national operator Energoatom said that due to a decrease in the frequency in the power system of Ukraine at the Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyy nuclear power plants, emergency protection worked, as a result of which all power units were automatically disconnected. Currently, they work in the design mode, without generation into the power system. It also said that the radiation background at the NPP sites is normal.\"\n\n\"The latest incident at the ZNPP highlights the increasingly precarious and challenging nuclear safety and security situation at Europes largest nuclear power plant, coming just a few days after it was repeatedly shelled,\" Director General Grossi said in a statement.\n\n1:53 p.m.: Officials in Moldova, which borders Ukraine, are reporting power outages following the latest Russian attacks on infrastructure in Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Massive blackout in Moldova after today's Russian attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure,\" Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu said on Twitter, adding the grid operator was trying to reconnect \"more than 50% of the country to electricity.\"\n\nMoldova, like Ukraine a former Soviet republic once dominated by Moscow but now pro-Western, has long worried about the prospect of fighting spreading across its borders.\n\n12:28 p.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for the urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss Russias latest attacks targeting Ukraines infrastructure.\n\n\"Murder of civilians, ruining of civilian infrastructure are acts of terror,\" Zelenskyy said on Twitter.\n\nIn a letter seen by VOA U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer, Ukraine is asking that Zelenskyy address the council meeting by video since he cant attend in person.\n\n11:59 a.m.: Widespread power outages are reported after the latest Russian airstrikes against Ukraines already-battered power grid, with Moscows forces apparently intent on inflicting anguish on Ukrainians at the onset of winter.\n\nAuthorities in the capital, Kyiv, said three people were killed in a strike that hit a two-story building. Ukrainian officials reported power outages in numerous cities, including parts of Kyiv, and in neighboring Moldova.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko posted on Telegram that \"one of the capital's infrastructure facilities has been hit,\" wounding one person.\n\nIn the western city of Lviv, near the border with Poland, the mayor said the whole city had lost power, although there was no immediate information on how many targets had been hit.\n\n11:23 a.m.:\n\n10:48 a.m.: The United States has authorized an additional $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"This $400 million drawdown includes additional arms, munitions, and air defense equipment from U.S. Department of Defense inventories. This drawdown will bring the total U.S. military assistance for Ukraine to an unprecedented level of approximately $19.7 billion, since the beginning of the Administration,\" Blinken said. \"The United States will continue to stand with more than 40 allies and partners in support of the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence with extraordinary courage and boundless determination.\"\n\n10 a.m.: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Grossi has met with a delegation from Russia over safety concerns at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, which again came under attack last week, RFE/RL reported.\n\n\"IAEA Director General @rafaelmgrossi met a Russian delegation led by Rosatom DG Alexey Likhachev in Istanbul today, for consultations on operational aspects related to safety at #Zaporizhzhya NPP in Ukraine & on urgently establishing a nuclear safety & security protection zone,\" the UN nuclear watchdog said in a tweet on Wednesday.\n\nAn IAEA team on the ground reported on November 20 that some of the plant's buildings, systems, and equipment were damaged in the attacks, raising safety concerns at Europe's largest nuclear power station.\n\nUkraine's energy agency Enerhoatom accused Russian forces of shelling the facility.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry countered that Ukrainian forces were the ones firing on power lines that supply the plant.\n\n9:01 a.m.: Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko accused Moscow on Wednesday of using \"gas blackmail\" for geopolitical purposes after Russia's state-run Gazprom said it could start reducing gas supplies to Moldova via Ukraine from November 28, Reuters reported.\n\nGazprom threatened its action after accusing Ukraine of withholding gas that was meant for Moldova.\n\n\"Gas blackmail is an established Russian practice that the Kremlin continues to use for geopolitical purposes,\" Galushchenko said in a written statement to Reuters.\n\n\"Having been defeated by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the battlefield, Russia is using dirty gas lies to once again try to tarnish Ukraine's international standing.\"\n\nHe said: \"Ukraine has for decades been, and continues to be, a reliable gas transit country for European partners.\"\n\nHe said Gazprom's accusations against Ukraine were groundless and \"may have another geopolitical purpose to increase political pressure on Moldova.\"\n\n\"After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia began to rapidly lose the European gas market. The Kremlin cannot accept this, which is why it is inventing new ways to regain its influence,\" he said.\n\n8:14 a.m.: An air-raid alert was issued across all Ukraine on Wednesday and Interfax Ukraine news agency reported explosions in several regions of southern and southeastern Ukraine, citing local channels in the Telegram messaging app.\n\nRussian forces have increasingly targeted Ukrainian critical infrastructure in recent weeks as they faced setbacks on the battlefield following their February 24 invasion.\n\n7:30 a.m.: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed European parliament decision to recognize Russia as state sponsor of terrorism. Zelenskyy said on Twitter, \"Russia must be isolated at all levels and held accountable in order to end its long-standing policy of terrorism in Ukraine and across the globe.\"\n\nThe resolution approved by EU lawmakers Wednesday cited \"deliberate attacks and atrocities carried out by the Russian Federation against the civilian population of Ukraine, the destruction of civilian infrastructure and other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.\"\n\n6:30 a.m.: There is evidence that Russian commanders in several instances were aware of sexual violence by military personnel in Ukraine \"and in some cases, encouraging it or even ordering it,\" according to an international criminal lawyer assisting Kyivs war crimes investigations.\n\nBritish lawyer Wayne Jordash told Reuters that in some areas around the capital of Kyiv in the north, where the probes are most advanced, some of the sexual violence involved a level of organization by Russian armed forces that \"speaks to planning on a more systematic level.\" He didnt identify specific individuals under scrutiny.\n\nThe previously unreported findings by investigators about the alleged role of commanders and the systematic nature of attacks in some locations are part of patterns of alleged sexual violence that are emerging as Russias war in Ukraine enters its ninth month.\n\n6:15 a.m.: The European Parliament on Wednesday decided to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, arguing Moscow's military strikes on civilian targets such as energy infrastructure, hospitals, schools and shelters violate international law.\n\nThe move is largely symbolic, though, as the European Union does not have a legal framework in place to back it up. At the same time, the bloc has already slapped unprecedented sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n6:03 a.m.: The Group of Seven nations are looking at a price cap on Russian sea-borne oil in the range of $65-70 per barrel, Reuters reported Wednesday citing a European Union diplomat.\n\nAmbassadors from the 27 EU countries were discussing the proposal with the aim of reaching a common position by the end of the day.\n\nThe G-7, including the United States, the EU and Australia, are slated to implement the price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil on December 5, as part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n5:30 a.m.: Britain is to send helicopters to Ukraine for the first time since Russia's invasion, the defense ministry in London said on Wednesday, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nTen crews of Ukrainian service personnel and engineers underwent a six-week training program in the U.K., as part of the \"first helicopter capability the UK has donated to Ukraine,\" the ministry said.\n\nIn addition to the three former British military Sea King helicopters, the first of which has already arrived, the U.K. will also supply an additional 10,000 artillery rounds.\n\n\"Our support for Ukraine is unwavering. These additional artillery rounds will help Ukraine to secure the land it has reclaimed from Russia in recent weeks,\" defense secretary Ben Wallace said.\n\n5 a.m.: The heads of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, and Russia's state-run nuclear energy agency Rosatom met in Istanbul to discuss the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power in southern Ukraine, Reuters reported citing statements by Rosatom and the IAEA.\n\nThe two sides agreed to continue cooperation and dialog over the facility, Europe's largest nuclear power plant, the RIA Novosti news agency quoted Rosatom as saying. Renewed shelling last weekend which Moscow and Kyiv blamed on each other raised fresh fears of a possible nuclear disaster at the site.\n\n4:30 a.m.: Pope Francis said on Wednesday that Ukrainians today were suffering from the \"martyrdom of aggression\" and compared the war to the \"terrible genocide\" of the 1930s, when Soviet leader Josef Stalin inflicted famine on the people there.\n\nHe was speaking at the end of his general audience before thousands of people in St. Peter's Square, Reuters reported.\n\n4:15 a.m.: As reported in an earlier update, Moldova said on Wednesday Russia had sent no signals that it would stop supplying it with gas next month but that it was ready for any scenario because Moscow was using energy resources as \"a tool of blackmail.\"\n\nState-run Russian gas company Gazprom accused Ukraine on Tuesday of keeping gas supplies destined for Moldova, and that it could from November 28 start reducing gas supplies to Moldova that pass through Ukraine.\n\nUkraine, which has been invaded by Russia, has denied withholding Russian gas meant for Moldova. Chisinau, which is dependent on Russia for its gas, said on Wednesday it would pay for any gas deliveries, according to Reuters.\n\n\"There are no signals that Russia will stop supplying gas to Moldova in December.

This could not be independently verified, but the Ukrainians say they've been shooting down roughly two-thirds to three-quarters of the incoming Russian missiles.\n\nHowever, the missiles and drones that do reach their target have put the country's energy system in jeopardy.\n\n\"More cruel missile strikes across the country as Russia tries to punish Ukraine for daring to be free,\" the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, said in a tweet. \"Russia's attempt to dominate Ukraine by plunging it into the cold and dark will fail.\"\n\nIn a statement, the energy company Ukrenergo said that the three nuclear power plants Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi were disconnected from the grid as a safety measure.\n\nAfter a brief emergency shutdown, the nuclear reactors have been turned back on, but were still not reconnected to the national grid, the company added.\n\nThe Russians are in control of a fourth nuclear plant, Zaporizhzhia, which came under shelling on Sunday.\n\nIn the west of the country, one regional administrator, Serhii Hamalii, said on Telegram that most of the surrounding area was without power and water due to the Russian attacks. This led to the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power station being taken offline.\n\nIn the southern region of Mykolaiv, the military administrator, Vitaliy Kim, also said the nuclear plant in his area has been cut from the grid, leading to a risky shutdown of the reactors there.\n\nUkrainian officials stress that the power cuts have the cascading effect of turning off the heat and water in many cases. And with temperatures often below freezing, the water in pipes could freeze, adding further complications.\n\nIn Moldova, President Maia Sandu wrote this about Russia on Facebook: \"We can't trust a regime that leaves us in the dark and cold, that purposely kills people for the mere desire to keep other peoples poor and humble.\"\n\nRussia has been unleashing large-scale strikes on Ukraine's power systems since Oct. 10 in an effort to cut off power to civilians as the country heads into winter.\n\nUkraine is scrambling to prepare for the winter. In a Tuesday night video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there are now 4,000 centers to take care of civilians if there are extended power cuts.\n\nHe called them \"points of invincibility,\" saying they will provide heat, water, phone charging and internet access. Many will be in schools and government buildings.\n\n\"All of us must be prepared for any scenario,\" he said. \"By helping each other, we will all be able to get through this winter together.\"\n\nJulian Hayda and Ashley Westerman contributed to this story from Kyiv.",

Another two landed in the square of the dry storage of nuclear waste, and three more hit the checkpoint-2 area.\n\nEarlier, Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, said that the Russian side would continue to communicate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This comes after the organisation called on Russia to abandon its claims to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.\n\nPrior to this, the IAEA Board of Governors adopted a resolution calling on Russia to leave the ZNPP. The IAEA resolution also stated that no traces of the manufacture of a dirty bomb had been found in Ukraine.\n\nVladimir Rogov, the chairman of the \"We are together with Russia\" movement, later insisted that the resolution calling on Russia to abandon the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was biased and politically motivated, as reported by gazeta.ru.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article.

The ZNPPs external power supplies, which have been knocked out several times during the conflict, were also not affected.\n\nThe latest shelling began shortly before 6pm local time yesterday and, after a lull, resumed at 9:15am today with more than a dozen blasts within 40 minutes. After the morning shelling, the area was again quiet, the team of IAEA experts reported in the afternoon today.\n\nAccording to the IAEA experts, site management reported damage in several places, including a radioactive waste and storage building, cooling pond sprinkler systems, an electrical cable to one of the diesel generators, condensate storage tanks, and to a bridge between a reactor and its auxiliary buildings.\n\n\"Once again, we were fortunate that a potentially serious nuclear incident did not happen. Next time, we may not be so lucky. We must do everything in our power to make sure there is no next time,\" Director General Grossi said, reiterating his call for urgent measures to protect the ZNPP and prevent a nuclear accident during the current conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe Director General said he has been in active consultations with world leaders today on the latest shelling at the ZNPP, and he is insisting that agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP must happen now.\n\n\"Even though there was no direct impact on key nuclear safety and security systems at the plant, the shelling came dangerously close to them. We are talking metres, not kilometres. Whoever is shelling at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, is taking huge risks and gambling with many peoples lives,\" Director General Grossi said.\n\nThe IAEA team of experts plan to conduct an assessment tomorrow of the shelling impact on the site.",

                "cc_text": "November 18, 8:30pm ET\n\nClick here to see ISWs interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nRussian officials are preparing for further covert mobilization efforts even as the fall conscription cycle is underway, likely further flooding the already overburdened Russian force generation apparatus in such a way that will be detrimental to the development of mobilized and conscripted servicemen. Russian Telegram channels actively discussed indicators on November 18 that the Kremlin is preparing for a second mobilization wave and circulated an image of a draft summons received by a citizen of St. Petersburg who was reportedly told to appear for mobilization in January 2023 despite Russian President Vladimir Putins announcement of the formal end of partial mobilization on October 31.[1] Nationalist milbloggers additionally circulated claims that general mobilization will begin in December or January.[2] An independent Russian outlet published an investigation on November 18 showing that state structures and enterprises are continuing to prepare their employees for mobilization by sending them to various training programs and mobilization-related educational courses.[3] Another Russian outlet noted that the Odintsovo garrison military court in Moscow Oblast inadvertently confirmed that mobilization is continuing despite its formal end.[4] The court reportedly accused a mobilized soldier of beating his commander on November 13 \"during the performance of his duties of military service or in connection with the performance of these duties during the period of mobilization,\" which indicates that the court is operating on the legal basis that mobilization is still very much underway.[5] The Kremlin has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin has no need to sign a decree formally ending the mobilization period, as ISW has previously reported.[6]\n\nThe continuation of covert mobilization efforts and potential preparations for another mobilization wave in tandem with the current fall conscription cycle are likely adding substantial strain to an already over-burdened Russian force generation apparatus. As ISW previously assessed, Putin likely ordered the end of partial mobilization in order to free up bureaucratic and administrative capacity for the November 1 conscription class.[7] However, it is evident that Russian authorities never fully halted mobilization efforts, which means that a limited number of mobilized recruits are still being forced through the training system at the same time as conscripts are going through their own training cycle. This will likely lead to even lower quality training for both mobilized recruits and conscripts as they compete for insufficient training capacity. Another wave of mobilization in the coming months will only worsen the situation and likely degrade the overall quality of the Russian troops that will be funneled to the frontline in Ukraine.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that it does not recognize the illegal Russian seizure and operation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) or the illegal annexation of occupied Ukrainian territory, a sharp escalation in IAEA rhetoric. The IAEAs Board of Governors issued a statement on November 17 that called on Russia to \"immediately abandon its baseless claims of ownership of the plant\" and to withdraw \"military and other personnel\" from the ZNPP due to \"grave concerns\" over the ZNPPs integrity.[8] The IAEA issued a statement on November 18 that Russian strikes on November 17 partially or completely cut power to Ukraines Khmelnytskyy Nuclear Power Plant and Rivne Nuclear Power Plant, and IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi stated that these strikes demonstrate \"the potential nuclear safety and security risks facing all of Ukraines nuclear facilities during this terrible war, not just the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.\"[9] ISW recently assessed that the IAEAs rhetorical shift suggests that Russian physical control and operational authority over the ZNPP alarms the IAEA.[10] Russian forces ongoing threats to both the ZNPP and Ukrainian nuclear power plants (NPPs) in unoccupied territory indicate that Russia is an unsuitable caretaker of the ZNPP, even though the Russian government relies on claims that it is a responsible operator of the ZNPP to legitimize its ongoing presence at the plant.[11]\n\nSocial media footage circulated on November 18 shows a Russian soldier opening fire on Ukrainians as other Russian soldiers were surrendering. The graphic footage shows Ukrainian troops in Makiivka, Luhansk Oblast, taking a group of Russian soldiers prisoner when one Russian soldier emerges from a house holding a gun and opens fire.[12] Drone footage shows the bodies of the deceased Russian soldiers after the incident.[13] Open-source analysts concluded that the Russian soldier opened fire initially, but it is unclear who killed the Russian prisoners, when, and under what circumstances.[14] However, the Russian information space immediately responded to the footage by widely accusing Ukrainian forces of a \"mass execution\" of the Russian prisoners.[15] The Russian Investigative Committee opened a criminal case against Ukrainian Armed Forces and is reportedly trying to identify the Ukrainian servicemen in the video.[16]\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nRussian officials are preparing for further covert mobilization efforts even as the fall conscription cycle is underway, likely further diminishing the development of quality mobilized and conscripted servicemen.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that it does not recognize the illegal Russian seizure of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) or the illegal annexation of other occupied Ukrainian territory, a sharp escalation in IAEA rhetoric.\n\nSocial media footage circulated on November 18 shows a Russian soldier opening fire on Ukrainians as other Russian soldiers were surrendering.\n\nRussian forces reinforced rear areas in Luhansk Oblast and attempted to regain lost positions as Ukrainian troops continued counteroffensive operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line.\n\nRussian forces continued limited ground assaults near Bakhmut and Avdiivka and in western Donetsk Oblast.\n\nRussian occupation officials and military leadership are seemingly increasingly concerned about subsequent Ukrainian counteroffensive operations in southern Ukraine.\n\nRussia continues to face exceedingly low morale and poor discipline among its forces against the backdrop of ongoing domestic backlash to partial mobilization.\n\nRussian occupation officials and forces continued to intensify filtration measures in Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine and to undermine the Ukrainian national identity.\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian CounteroffensivesEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and one supporting effort);\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortCapture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting EffortSouthern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast)\n\nRussian forces reinforced rear areas in Luhansk Oblast and attempted to regain lost positions as Ukrainian troops continued counteroffensive operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line on November 18. The Ukrainian General Staff noted that Russian forces freed up by the Russian retreat from the west (right) bank of Kherson Oblast transferred to Novoaidar, Luhansk Oblast, (55km southeast of Kreminna at the nexus of the T1306 Novoaidar-Severodonetsk and H21 Novoaidar-Starobilsk routes).[17] Ukrainian military sources also reported that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks on Novoselivkse and Stelmakhivka, both within 13km northwest of Svatove.[18] Russian sources also claimed that Ukrainian troops attacked in this area toward Kuzemivka (13km northwest of Svatove).[19] Geolocated footage shows Ukrainian airborne troops destroying a Russian TOR-M2 surface-to-air missile complex in Dachne, 3km west of Svatove.[20] Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian troops unsuccessfully attacked toward Chervonopopivka (6km northwest of Kreminna) and are continuing attempts to attack southeast of Kreminna toward Lysychansk and Popasna.[21]\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nRussian forces continued limited ground assaults near Bakhmut and Avdiivka and in western Donetsk Oblast on November 18. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground assaults northeast of Bakhmut near Spirne and Bilohorivka and south of Bakhmut near Opytne.[22] Luhansk Peoples Republic (LNR) Deputy Interior Minister Vitaly Kiselyov claimed that Wagner Group forces repelled Ukrainian counterattacks on the southeastern outskirts of Bakhmut and near Opytne.[23] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground attacks southwest of Avdiivka near Pervomaiske and Vodyane, and southwest of Donetsk City near Novomykhailivka.[24] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed on November 17 that Russian forces captured Opytne (4 km southwest of Avdiivka), two days after the Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) claimed that its forces captured the settlement.[25] ISW is currently unable to confirm these Russian territorial claims. Geolocated footage posted on November 17 shows that Russian forces made marginal gains advancing west toward Pervomaiske.[26] The Russian MoD claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian ground attacks east of Vuhledar near Solodke, southeast of Vuhledar near Volodymyrivka, and southwest of Vuhledar near Pavlivka.[27]\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nNote: ISW will report on activities in Kherson Oblast as part of the Southern Axis in this and subsequent updates. Ukraines counteroffensive in right-bank Kherson Oblast has accomplished its stated objectives, so ISW will not present a Southern Ukraine counteroffensive section until Ukrainian forces resume counteroffensives in southern Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces continued to conduct defensive operations on the east (left) bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast on November 18. Ukraines Southern Operational Command reported that Russian forces continue to equip defensive lines and replenish their forces in eastern Kherson Oblast.[28] Ukraines Southern Operational Command also reported that Russian forces continue to draw further back from the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, forcibly relocating civilians from Novokiivka and transporting medical equipment from Nova Kakhovovka to Crimea.[29] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces continued to strike areas on the western (right) bank of the Dnipro River, including Kherson City, Chornobaivka, Antonivka, and Beryslav.[30]\n\nUkrainian forces continued to strike Russian military assets and concentration areas south of the Dnipro River. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on November 18 that Ukrainian strikes in previous days killed over 50 Russian military personnel in Skadovsk and destroyed an ammunition depot in Chaplynka.[31] Ukraines Southern Operational Command stated that Ukrainian strikes destroyed military assets along the eastern bank of the river, including in Nova Kakhovka, Hola Prystan, and Oleshky.[32]\n\nRussian occupation officials and military leadership are seemingly increasingly concerned about subsequent Ukrainian counteroffensive operations in southern Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff stated that Russian forces are accumulating engineering equipment to construct defensive lines in Mykhailivka Raion, Zaporizhia Oblast, (on the T0810 and T0818 highway intersection and connects Melitopol to the checkpoint at Vasylivka and Enerhodar) and are using production enterprises in Zaporizhia Oblast to construct more defensive structures.[33] Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official Vladimir Rogov stated that Russian officials are not preparing for a winter \"lull\" in hostilities in Zaporizhia Oblast.[34] Crimean occupation head Sergei Aksyonov announced on November 18 that Russian forces are building defensive lines in northern Crimea after satellite imagery emerged on November 10 of Russian defensive lines in the area.[35] As ISW has previously reported, Russian forces have increasingly relied on logistics lines through southern Ukraine, particularly connecting Melitopol to Crimea, to supply forces in southern Ukraine following the attack on the Kerch Strait Bridge.[36]\n\nRussian forces continued routine fire against areas in Zaporizhia, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts on November 18. Ukrainian official sources reported that Russian forces struck Zaporizhzhia City, Dnipro City, and Odesa City.[37] Ukrainian officials also reported that Russian forces shelled Nikopol and Marhanets, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and Ochakiv, Mykolaiv Oblast, just north of the Kinburn Spit.[38]\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nRussia continues to face exceedingly low morale and poor discipline among its forces against the backdrop of ongoing domestic backlash to partial mobilization. A Russian source reported a case of drunken mobilized men engaging in a mass physical altercation at the Leninsky market in Omsk, Russia around November 6.[39] Footage posted on November 18 showed Russian conscripts complaining about being mismanaged.[40] A Russian source highlighted that Russian authorities continue to mobilize men with health problems and men originally promised deferments without explanation.[41] Citizens of St. Petersburg amplified Russian troops complaints of poor training, failing equipment, and mistreatment by demanding change and picketing in front of the Western Military District Headquarters in St. Petersburg.[42] A Russian media source reported that a Russian court ruled to block links to a popular petition against mobilization on Change.org that had over 500,000 signatures.[43] Another Russian source reported that Russian authorities forced college students to go to a military training camp in Dolgoprudny, Moscow Oblast, under the threat that they would not receive their diplomas otherwise.[44] The source stated that these students fear that Russian authorities will mobilize them after this training.[45] A Russian milblogger criticized Russian authorities mismanagement of mobilization and failure to properly train and equip mobilized Russians as a \"war crime.\"[46]\n\nRussian forces continued efforts to expand training capabilities and replenish diminishing supplies. The Russian MoD shared multiple reports on November 17 of mobilized Russian troops training at centers in Buryatia Republic, Kaliningrad Oblast, and Novosibirsk Oblast.[47] The Russian MoD emphasized that experienced instructors are training mobilized men in various combat skills including weapons training, hand-to-hand combat, operating drones, and first aid.[48] The Russian MoD is likely presenting these reports in a continued attempt to quell public dissatisfaction with the level of training mobilized servicemen are receiving. A Russian source reported on November 18 that Russian forces began to receive Iranian-made flak jackets and helmets, which is consistent with previous reports that Russian forces are relying on foreign-provided weapons and armor due to a shortage of domestic supply.[49] Multiple Russian sources reported that the Russian public has had to supplement Russian supply shortages with their own contributions.[50]\n\nRussian occupation authorities continued forced mobilization efforts in Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories on November 18. The Ukrainian General Staff and the Luhansk Oblast Administration reported that the Russian Ministry of Health ordered healthcare workers in Luhansk Oblast to register for military service to fill staffing vacancies because Russian losses have greatly strained the Russian occupation medical network.[51] Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov also confirmed reports that Russian occupation officials plan to forcibly mobilize Russian passport holders in the southern occupied territories into the Russian forces.[52]\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nRussian occupation officials and forces continued to intensify filtration measures in Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine on November 18. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported that occupation officials evacuated local residents suspected of pro-Ukrainian activities in Mykhailivka, Zaporizhia Oblast, and sent them to Tymoshivka, Zaporizhia Oblast with the aid of local collaborators.[53] Multiple Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces forcibly evacuated residents of Novokyivka, Kherson Oblast.[54] The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported that Russian doctors examined Ukrainian children and sent them to Russia for treatment.[55] The Ukrainian Zaporizhia Oblast Military Administration reported that Russian officials evacuated 170 people, including 37 children, from Zaporizhia Oblast in one day.[56] Sevastopol Occupation Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev reported that 79 evacuated residents from Kherson Oblast arrived in Sevastopol, Crimea, and stated that Crimean officials are organizing appropriate documentation for them.[57]\n\nRussian occupation officials continued efforts to undermine the Ukrainian national identity. The Luhansk Oblast Administration reported that occupation officials appointed a Russian citizen from Novosibirsk, Novosibirsk Oblast, as director of a secondary school in Novooleskandrivka, Luhansk Oblast, and that occupation officials forced Ukrainian civil servants to sign documents renouncing their Ukrainian citizenship.[58] The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported that occupation officials held school events to teach Ukrainian children how to detect pro-Ukrainian residents and how to notify Russian occupation officials about them.[59] The Center clarified that so far, Ukrainian children are not yet going to officials to inform on pro-Ukrainian activities and are only telling their parents.\n\nRussian occupation officials continued to face difficulties dealing with wounded Russian forces in occupied Ukrainian territory on November 18. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported that occupation officials brought in Russian doctors and medical interns to the occupied territories because Ukrainian residents refused to provide medical services to Russian soldiers and the number of wounded Russian forces is increasing.[60] Ukrainian Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov amplified reports from recent days that Russian occupation officials are attempting to collect blood from Ukrainian residents for wounded Russian forces.[61] Fedorov reiterated that occupation officials are expelling Ukrainian residents from the Melitopol hospital inpatient unit to free up wards for wounded Russian forces.[62]\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) Russia unleashed a new missile onslaught on Ukraine's battered energy grid Wednesday, robbing cities of power and some of water and public transport, too, compounding the hardship of winter for millions. The aerial mauling of power supplies also took nuclear plants and internet links offline and spilled blackouts into neighbour Moldova.\n\nMultiple regions reported attacks in quick succession and cascading outages. Ukraine's Energy Ministry said supplies were cut to \"the vast majority of electricity consumers.\" Lviv's trams and trolleybuses stopped running as the city in western Ukraine lost both power and water, the mayor said. All of Kyiv lost water, the capital's mayor said. Power also went out and public transport stopped in Kharkiv, the mayor of that northeastern city, Ukraine's second largest, said.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy instructed Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations to request an urgent Security Council meeting and demanded a \"resolute\" international response.\n\nThe ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, called the strikes \"another act of terror against the civilian population\" and said they \"left most of the country without electricity, water and heating.\"\n\nThree people were killed and 11 wounded in a strike in Kyiv, city authorities said. Another four people were killed and 35 wounded in the wider Kyiv region, its governor said.\n\n\"I was going up the escalator, I heard an explosion. Then the electricity suddenly disappeared,\" said Kyiv subway passenger Oleksii Kolpachov. \"When I got out of the subway, there was a column of smoke.\"\n\nRussia has been pounding the power grid and other facilities with missiles and exploding drones for weeks, wreaking damage faster than it can be repaired. Strikes had already damaged around half of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Zelenskyy said before the latest barrage, and rolling power outages had become the horrid new normal for millions.\n\nUkrainian officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin is hoping that the misery of unheated and unlit homes in winter's cold and dark will turn public opinion against a continuation of the war but say it's instead strengthening Ukrainian resolve.\n\nUkraine's Air Force said Russia launched around 70 cruise missiles and 51 were shot down, as were five exploding drones. The afternoon timing of the barrage as was also the case last week left workers toiling into the winter darkness to restore supplies.\n\nIn Kyiv, a city of three million, the administration said water and heating would only return to residential buildings on Thursday morning.\n\nLate Wednesday and well after dark, the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office said that Kyiv and over a dozen regions, including Lviv and Odesa in the south, had been reconnected to the power grid.\n\nMoldova, with Soviet-era energy systems interconnected with Ukraine, also reported massive power outages for the second time this month. President Maia Sandu accused Moscow of plunging the country of 2.6 million into darkness and the foreign minister summoned Russia's ambassador for explanations.\n\nUkraine's state-owned nuclear operator, Energoatom, said the country's last three fully functioning nuclear power stations were all disconnected from the power grid in an \"emergency protection\" measure. It said radiation levels were unchanged at the sites and \"all indicators are normal.\"\n\nThe Energy Ministry said the attacks also caused a temporary blackout of most thermal and hydroelectric power plants, and also affected transmission facilities. Repair teams were working \"but given the extent of the damage, we will need time,\" it said on Facebook.\n\nWednesday's blackouts also caused \"the largest internet outage in Ukraine in months and the first to affect neighbouring Moldova, which has since partially recovered,\" said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at network-monitoring Kentik Inc.\n\nThe onslaught followed an overnight Russian rocket attack in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine that destroyed a hospital maternity ward, killing a two-day-old newborn boy and critically injuring a doctor.",

Only units 1 and 2 (left) are completed and in operation (Image: Energoatom)\n\nUkraines largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia, which is on the front line of the conflict and has been forced to rely on its emergency diesel generators on a number of occasions when it has lost external power supplies. This is the first time that other operating nuclear power plants in Ukraine are known to have had such issues.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, said: \"This was a very concerning development. It shows the potential nuclear safety and security risks facing all of Ukraines nuclear facilities during this terrible war, not just the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. While off-site power is now back at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant, yesterdays power loss clearly demonstrates that the nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine can suddenly take a turn for the worse, increasing the risk of a nuclear emergency.\"\n\nKhmelnitsky lost its grid connection at 18:35 local time on 15 November after its four operating power lines were taken out of operation by missile strikes over a two and a half hour period, according to reports submitted by Ukrainian authorities to the IAEA. The two reactors at the plant were shut down, with the diesel generators only able to be switched off at 03:45 local time on 16 November when power supplies were restored via two 330 kV back-up power lines. According to the latest status report on the morning of 17 November from Energoatom, it was operating as usual at 09:00 local time.\n\nRivne also lost connection to one of its 750 kV lines on the afternoon of 15 November and one of its four units was automatically disconnected.\n\nEarlier this week the IAEA announced it would be sending experts to the three operating nuclear power plants in Ukraine, plus Chernobyl. It already has a permanent team based at Zaporizhzhia plant, which has been under the control of the Russian military since early March.\n\nGrossi said: \"We will be at these nuclear power plants in the near future as part of our steadfast assistance to Ukraine in its efforts to maintain nuclear safety and security and prevent a nuclear accident during the conflict.\"\n\nNuclear power plants need power for essential cooling and safety functions, even if in shutdown and not producing electricity. Emergency diesel generators have an important role to play but they are not intended to be used for extended periods of time.\n\nResearched and written by World Nuclear News\n\nRelated topics",

The head of Russia's state-run nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, said it had discussed Sunday's shelling with the IAEA, and said there was a risk of a nuclear accident.\n\nThe assault came as battles raged further east following Russian troop movements into the industrial Donbas region from around Ukraine's recently recaptured Kherson in the south.\n\nWhoever fired on the plant was taking \"huge risks and gambling with many people's lives\", said Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nIAEA experts toured the site on Monday, and the agency said they found widespread damage but nothing that compromised the plant's essential systems.\n\n\"They were able to confirm that despite the severity of the shelling key equipment remained intact and there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns,\" it said in a statement issued on Monday evening.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify which side was responsible. The attacks also hit a cooling pond, a cable to one reactor and a bridge to another, according to an IAEA team on the ground citing information provided by plant management.\n\n\"We were fortunate a potentially serious nuclear incident did not happen. Next time, we may not be so lucky,\" Grossi said in a statement late on Sunday, describing the situation as a \"close call\".\n\n\"We are talking metres, not kilometres,\" he said.\n\nRepeated shelling of the plant during the war has raised concern about a grave disaster in the country that suffered the world's worst nuclear accident, the 1986 Chornobyl meltdown.\n\nRadiation levels remained normal and there were no reports of casualties, the IAEA said. While there was no direct impact on nuclear safety and security systems, \"the shelling came dangerously close\", Grossi said.\n\nMISSILE STRIKES\n\nRussia's response to military setbacks in recent weeks has included a barrage of missile strikes, many on power facilities that have left much of the country without electricity as winter sets in and temperatures drop below freezing.\n\nA view shows Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant from the town of Nikopol, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine November 7, 2022. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nZelenskiy said that half of the country's power capacity had been knocked out by Russian rockets.\n\nGrossi spoke to world leaders and reiterated the need for a nuclear safety and security protection zone around Zaporizhzhia, the IAEA said.\n\nCEO Alexei Likhachev said Rosatom been in negotiations with the IAEA \"all night\", Interfax reported.\n\nRosatom has controlled the facility through a subsidiary since President Vladimir Putin in October ordered Russia to formally seize the plant and transfer Ukrainian staff to a Russian entity. Kyiv says the transfer of assets amounts to theft.\n\nKyiv controls territory across the river from the power station, including the regional capital. The Zaporizhzhia plant itself and territory south of it fell to Russia in March.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant provided about a fifth of Ukraine's electricity before Russia's invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times. It has six Soviet-designed VVER-1000 V-320 water-cooled and water-moderated reactors containing Uranium 235.\n\nThe reactors are shut down but there is a risk that nuclear fuel could overheat if the power driving the cooling systems is cut. Shelling has repeatedly cut power lines.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Ukraine fired at power lines supplying the plant. Ukraine's nuclear energy firm Energoatom said Russia's military shelled the site, accusing it of nuclear blackmail and actions that were \"endangering the whole world\".\n\n'FIERCEST BATTLES'\n\nRussian forces pulled out of the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine ten days ago in one of the biggest retreats of the war, after being driven out of Kharkiv province in the northeast in September and away from the capital Kyiv in April.\n\nMoscow has been reinforcing the areas it still holds, and pressing an offensive of its own along a stretch of front line west of the city of Donetsk held by its proxies since 2014.\n\nUkraine's military said late on Monday Russian forces had tried to make advances around Bakhmut and Avdiivka in Donetsk, and bombarded nearby towns.\n\nPresidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was bombarding Kherson from across the Dnipro river, now that its troops had fled.\n\n\"There is no military logic: they just want to take revenge on the locals. This is a huge war crime live,\" he tweeted. Moscow denies intentionally targeting civilians in what it calls a \"special military operation\" to disarm Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian police and prosecutors have identified four places in Kherson where they suspect Russian forces tortured people before abandoning the city, Ukraine's prosecutor general's office said on Monday. Moscow denies its troops have carried out atrocities in areas they occupy.\n\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge in London, Maria Starkova in Lviv, Pavel Polityuk in Kyiv, Caleb Davis in Gdansk, David Ljunggren in Ottawa, Francois Murphy in Vienna and Lidia Kelly in Melbourne; Writing by Frank Jack Daniel and Peter Graff; Editing by Alex Richardson, William Maclean\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The problem is worse in Ukrainian regions occupied by Russia, with one in three people there unable to get the medicine they need, Habicht added.\n\nIt is a problem that will be exacerbated by heavy snowfall during Ukraine's harsh winter season, which poses a \"formidable challenge\" to the health system, the WHO official warned.\n\nMost Ukrainians left without power after new Russian strikes\n\nA punishing new barrage of Russian strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure on Wednesday caused power outages across large parts of the country as well as neighboring Moldova, piling more damage onto Ukraine's already battered power network and adding to the misery for civilians as winter begins.\n\nMultiple regions reported attacks in quick succession and Ukraine's Energy Ministry said that \"the vast majority of electricity consumers were cut off.\" Officials in Kyiv said three people were killed and nine wounded in the capital after a Russian strike hit a two-story building.\n\nRussia has been pounding the power grid and other facilities with missiles and exploding drones for weeks and the energy system is being damaged faster than it can be repaired.\n\nBefore the latest barrage, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had said that Russian strikes had already damaged around half of Ukraine's energy infrastructure.\n\nRolling power outages have become the horrid new normal for millions and the latest barrage affected water supplies, too.

He said water supplies were knocked out in all of Kyiv.\n\nThere were power outages in parts of Kyiv, while power was out in the wider Kyiv region, in the northern city of Kharkiv, the western city of Lviv, and in all or part of the Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Odesa and Khmelnytskyi regions. In Moldova, Infrastructure Minister Andrei Spinu said that \"we have massive power outages across the country,\" whose Soviet-era energy systems remain interconnected with Ukraine.\n\nRussian attack helicopter flown in war displayed at Dubai air show View Gallery\n\nIt was the second outage this month in Moldova. The country's pro-Western president, Maia Sandu, said in a statement that \"Russia left Moldova in the dark.\" She said that the future of Moldova, a country of about 2.6 million people, \"must remain toward the free world.\" Moldova's foreign minister said the Russian ambassador was being summoned to give explanations.\n\nUkraine's state-owned nuclear operator, Energoatom, said the strikes led to the country's last three fully functioning nuclear power stations all being disconnected from the power grid in an \"emergency protection\" measure. It said they would resume supplying electricity as soon as the grid is \"normalised.\"\n\nEnergoatom said on its Telegram channel that radiation levels at the sites are unchanged and \"all indicators are normal.\"\n\nThe Energy Ministry said the attacks also caused a temporary blackout of most thermal and hydroelectric power plants, and transmission facilities also were affected.

(AP)\n\n\"Then parts of the city would have to be evacuated, but we don't want it to come to that!\"\n\nThe Kremlin has been accused of deliberately targeting Ukraine's civilian power grid in an effort to leave the civilian population without electricity and heat an act that would amount to a war crime. A senior US State Department official said Monday that a consistent pattern of Russian attacks on civilian elements in Ukraine was \"deeply troubling.\"\n\nIn a symbolic move that echoed Western leaders' condemnation of Russia's invasion, the European Parliament on Wednesday recognised the country \"as a state sponsor of terrorism and as a state which uses means of terrorism.\"\n\nThe EU Parliament called on the European Union \"to further isolate Russia internationally\" in a non-binding resolution, according to a press release.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the decision.\n\n\"Russia must be isolated at all levels and held accountable in order to end its long-standing policy of terrorism in Ukraine and across the globe,\" he tweeted.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also on Twitter thanked the European Parliament \"for the clear stance.\"",

Andrew Harnik/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nWASHINGTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The Biden administration said on Monday it has approved conditional funding of up to $1.1 billion to prevent the closure of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California, as part of its effort to fight climate change.\n\nThe Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG.N) plant, which was set to fully shut in 2025, applied for funding in the initial phase of the Department of Energy's (DOE) $6 billion Civil Nuclear Credit program meant to help keep struggling nuclear power reactors open. Diablo is the last operating nuclear plant in California.\n\nThe Biden administration believes nuclear power is critical in curbing climate change and wants to keep plants open ahead of the development of next-generation reactors. President Joe Biden wants to decarbonize the power grid by 2035.\n\nThe U.S. nuclear power industry's 92 reactors generate more than half of the country's virtually carbon-free electricity. But about a dozen reactors have closed since 2013 in the face of competition from renewable energy and plants that burn plentiful natural gas.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said the grant was a \"critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power to Americans as the nation's largest source of clean electricity.\"\n\nPG&E Chief Executive Patti Poppe told Reuters earlier this month that the company is applying to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a license to allow Diablo to continue operating. Poppe said the plant is also ordering more uranium fuel for the reactor, and dry casks for storing nuclear waste.\n\n\"There have been constraints on access to uranium,\" following Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Poppe said.\n\nEARTHQUAKE RISK\n\nCritics of keeping open the 2,240-Megawatt Diablo Canyon plant, located next to the Pacific Ocean in San Luis Obispo County, say the region is vulnerable to earthquakes and that there is no permanent place for disposing of radioactive nuclear waste.\n\nSuzanne Hosn, a PG&E spokesperson, said Diablo can \"safely withstand extreme natural events, including potential earthquakes, tsunamis and flooding.\"\n\nHosn pointed to analyses performed in 2015 by the NRC after the 2011 crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan that was slammed by a tsunami, releasing radioactive materials and forcing the evacuation of some 80,000 residents. The NRC said in the 2015 reports that Diablo was safe from tsunamis including ones generated by underwater landslides and earthquakes.\n\n\"We can protect these facilities and the communities they serve,\" Granholm said.\n\nRadioactive waste from nuclear power is currently held in casks and pools on site at plants across the country. The administration of former President Barack Obama killed the multibillion-dollar Yucca Mountain project designed to permanently store nuclear waste underground in Nevada due to local opposition.\n\nSome politicians who have been wary of problems associated with nuclear waste have come out in support of the Civil Nuclear Credit program.\n\nU.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, said extending the life of Diablo was necessary for the state to meet its clean energy goals and to deliver reliable power. Feinstein said she would monitor safety and environmental reviews of Diablo.\n\nNot every plant that applied is getting funding in the initial phase of the program. Holtec International, which in May bought the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan, said on Friday that DOE rejected its application for funding.\n\nFinal terms of the grant to PG&E are subject to negotiation and finalization, DOE said.\n\nReporting by Timothy Gardner; additional reporting by David Gaffen and Susan Heavey, Editing by Toby Chopra, Paul Simao and Bill Berkrot\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nLONDON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Repeated shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has raised the possibility of a grave accident just 500 km (300 miles) from the site of the world's worst nuclear accident, the 1986 Chornobyl disaster.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has repeatedly expressed concerns over the shelling of the plant, has proposed the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant.\n\nWhat nuclear material is at Europe's largest nuclear power plant, what are the risks and why are Russia and Ukraine fighting over it?\n\nWHAT IS IT?\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six Soviet-designed VVER-1000 V-320 water-cooled and water-moderated reactors containing Uranium 235, which has a half-life of more than 700 million years.\n\nConstruction began in 1980 and its sixth reactor was connected to the grid in 1995. All six reactors are now in cold shutdown after reactor No. 6 was shut down on Sept. 12.\n\nA cold shutdown means the reactor's temperature is below boiling point but electrical pumps moving water through the reactor core must still keep working to cool the fuel.\n\nThe plant is no longer producing electricity.\n\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS?\n\nThe biggest risk is from overheating nuclear fuel, which could happen if the power that drives the cooling systems was cut. Shelling has repeatedly cut power lines.\n\nThe plant lost its last remaining external power on Oct. 8, leaving it reliant on diesel generators for more than a day, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. The power line was restored on Oct. 9.\n\nBefore the war, the plant had four high-voltage power lines giving it access to the grid as well as several backup lines.\n\nCOULD THE REACTOR MELT DOWN?\n\nPressurised water is used to transfer heat away from the reactors even when they are shutdown, and pumped water is also used to cool down removed spent nuclear fuel from the reactors.\n\nIf the power was cut and auxiliary systems such as 20 diesel generators (which have enough diesel for 10 days) failed to keep the reactors cool, then the fuel could melt down and the zirconium cladding could release hydrogen.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IN A MELTDOWN?\n\nA meltdown of the fuel, which remains extremely hot for some time even after the reactor shutdown, could begin a fire or explosion that could release a plume of radionuclides into the air where they could be spread over a large area.\n\nThe Chornobyl accident spread Iodine-131, Caesium-134, Strontium-90 and Caesium-137 across parts of northern Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, northern and central Europe.\n\nNearly 8.4 million people in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine were exposed to radiation, according to the United Nations. Around 50 deaths are directly attributed to the disaster itself.\n\nBut 600,000 \"liquidators\", involved in fire-fighting and clean-up operations, were exposed to high doses of radiation. Hundreds of thousands were resettled.\n\nThere is mounting evidence that the health impact of the Chornobyl disaster was much more serious than initially presented at the time and in the years following the accident.\n\nIncidence of thyroid cancer in children across swathes of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine increased after the accident. There was a much higher incidence of endocrine disorders, anaemia and respiratory diseases among children in contaminated areas.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE SPENT FUEL?\n\nBesides the reactors, there is also a dry spent fuel storage facility at the site for used nuclear fuel assemblies, and spent fuel pools at each reactor site that are used to cool down the used nuclear fuel.\n\n\"The basins of spent fuel are just big pools with uranium fuel rods in them - they are really hot depending on how long they have been there,\" Kate Brown, an environmental historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose book \"Manual for Survival\" documents the full scale of the Chornobyl disaster, said in August.\n\n\"If fresh water is not put in, then the water will evaporate. Once the water evaporates, then the zirconium cladding will heat up and it can catch fire and then we have a bad situation - a fire of irradiated uranium which is very like the Chornobyl situation releasing a whole complex of radioactive isotopes.\"\n\nAn emission of hydrogen from a spent fuel pool caused an explosion at reactor 4 in Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Ukrainian submission to the IAEA, there was a total of more than 2,200 tonnes of nuclear material excluding the reactors.\n\nWHO CONTROLS IT?\n\nAfter invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russian forces took control of the plant in early March.\n\nSpecial Russian military units guard the facility and Russian nuclear specialists are on site. Ukrainian staff continue to help operate the plant.\n\nAfter Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed a swathe of Ukraine, including the area where the nuclear plant is located, he signed a decree on Oct. 5 to formalise Russian control over the plant.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has proposed the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant.\n\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Alex Richardson\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Moscow hopes to exhaust Ukraine's missile defenses, and buy time to reset its forces, Pentagon officials say.\n\nAustin said Russia was breaking the laws of war.\n\n\"These aren't just lapses. These aren't exceptions to the rule. These are atrocities,\" Austin said.\n\n\"Russian missile barrages have left innocent Ukrainians without heat, water, and electricity. We've seen schools attacked. Children killed. Hospitals bombed. Centers of Ukrainian history and culture reduced to rubble.\"\n\nMoscow denies that its armed forces deliberately target civilians or civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe United States and its allies have helped provide arms, intelligence and training to Ukrainian forces, while stopping short of directly intervening in a war against nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin speaks during a news briefing after participating a virtual Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., November 16, 2022. REUTERS/Tom Brenner Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nAustin said the United States wouldn't get dragged into Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"war of choice,\" but warned of the risks of global nuclear proliferation if Moscow were to prevail.\n\n\"Putin's fellow autocrats are watching. And they could well conclude that getting nuclear weapons would give them a hunting license of their own,\" Austin said. \"And that could drive a dangerous spiral of nuclear proliferation.\"\n\nJust days after U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks on Monday, Austin said that Beijing, like Moscow, sought \"a world where might makes right.\"\n\nAustin said Chinese aircraft were flying near self-ruled Taiwan in record numbers almost daily, while the number of what he called \"dangerous intercepts\" by China of U.S. or allied forces at sea or in the air were increasing.\n\nTensions between Taipei and Beijing have risen since China staged war games near the democratically-governed island in August after a visit by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nBeijing, which views Taiwan as a Chinese province, has long said it would bring the self-governed island under its control and has not ruled out the use of force to do so.\n\nThe government in Taipei rejects Beijing's claims and says only Taiwan's people can decide its future.\n\nAustin said the United States was drawing on the lessons of Ukraine to \"bolster the self-defense capabilities of our Indo-Pacific partners.\"\n\n\"We're helping them to become more agile and resilient,\" Austin said.\n\nReporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Diane Craft and Daniel Wallis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "For decades now, since 1987, two pressurized water nuclear power plants here on the Cotentin Peninsula, located about 15 miles southwest of the port city of Cherbourg on the English Channel, have produced about 4 percent of Frances electrical power, forming a significant part of a 56-plant network that satisfies 75 percent of all electricity consumption in the worlds seventh largest economy.\n\nThese \"Generation 2\" reactorsidentifiable the world over by their round containment domesshare many characteristics, and some of the flaws, common to the hundreds of plants built across the world in the first wave of nuclear plant construction. There have been routine shutdowns for turbine issues, questions about corrosion and tensile steel resilience, and, of course, local backlash at the very real anxiety average people feel living close to these behemoths. Indeed, right now both are offline for maintenance checks amid record heat that has sorely tested Frances electrical grid. But no meltdowns, no serious releases of radioactive gas, no tsunamis. All in all, in the cold calculus of risk and reward, these plants have produced enormous benefit: per capital annual CO2 emissions in France are 1/3 what they are in the United States (4.24 metric tons v metric 14.24 tons per person), largely due to nuclear powers contribution to the French electricity grid.\n\nThe French model of nuclear energy, long cited by advocates of nuclear power as an example of how the atom can be safely harnessed to produce green power at scale with minimal safety issues, stems from a simple decision: build plants based on a proven design, iteratively improved but not radically altered to ensure lessons learned and efficiencies gained are reproduced. Its the same way Henry Ford once rolled out Model Ts in Detroit.\n\nFrances first nuclear reactor, the Zoe reactor near Paris, became operative in 1947. Like other reactors of that era, Zoe was a research reactor: In effect, a prototype which until its decommissioning in 1976 was meant to define what is possible, and what is not. Based on these learnings, France built several Generation One plants that began contributing electricity to the national grid in the 1950s and 1960s. But its nuclear build-out really took off just after the Arab Oil embargo reminded the world in 1973 of the drawbacks of depending on foreign oil imports. By 1980, the country had embarked on an unprecedented effort to replace all fossil fuel power generation with nuclear. While that particular goal proved too ambitious, the country did build 50 Generation Two plants in the 15 years starting in 1980, most from a common design, making France a net exporter of electricity and the undisputed leader among industrial nations in meeting electrical demand without carbon emissions. This is a distinction France maintained until 2020, when Chinas surging nuclear power construction efforts finally overtook it.\n\nWhen France first opted for nuclear power, climate change science was then still in its infancy, of course, so observers were not focused on the emissions benefits. But they did care about cost and safety. And on that score, France also performed admirably. Since 1947, when post-war statistics first reflected nuclear powers contribution, French electricity rates have consistently been the lowest in Western Europe. And while by no means accident free (a short timeline of French nuclear mishaps can be found on Reuters), the plants have operated safely enough to keep nuclear power highly popular in France.\n\nThe secret to French success, its nuclear engineers say, are common design features across most plants, technical prowess, and an aggressive regulation of a common nuclear custodian: All of Frances 56 active nuclear plants, spread across 20 sites, are operated by EDF, a company which is 85 percent owned by the French state. This has led many, including those who oppose state ownership of key economic assets, to accuse France of papering over problems. Theres also the issue of potential regulatory capture.\n\nBut the numbers tell a good story for French nuclear power, and France has doubled down on its success. In 2021, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that the country would construct at least 14 advanced nuclear plants in the next 15 years, with six plants of the new European Pressurized Water 2 (EPR-2) design slated to begin construction in 2025 and start coming online by 2035. This will coincide with the scheduled retirement of many of the Generation Two plants built during the first wave of nuclear construction, some of which have already been extended beyond their planned 40-year life. The new plants wouldat least on paperproduce far more electricity than the legacy plants they will ultimately replace.\n\nAfter decades of pursing a \"rinse, wash, repeat\" approach to nuclear power, Frances decision to co-develop the Generation Three EPR design with Siemens of Germany, involved significant risk. But leaders of the French nuclear industry, along with their political masters, committed to advancing the power generation capacity of nuclear plants while at the same time adding new, often double- and triple-failsafe backstops that would make these plants even safer than the Generation Two plants, which already performed so well.\n\nFrances Nuclear Drawing Board\n\nIn a country like France, where nuclear power has earned a generally positive reputation by following a proven blueprint, the attempt to leap a generation with the EPR design exposed the countrys nuclear engineers to perils their American counterparts know all too well.\n\nIn the American system, where nuclear power had its own golden age of construction in the 1970s and 1980s, innovation and variable designs among plants proved a disadvantage, incentivizing the prioritization of cost savings and other commercial concerns over safety. Variable design also stretched thin the U.S. regulator, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), to its intellectual breaking point as it was forced to regulate so many new types of plant and codify the processes that would safeguard them. At Three Mile Island in 1978, one could argue, that breaking point was achieved when a combination of mechanical failure, erroneous sensor readings, and human error caused the reactor core to overheat and release a small amount of radioactive material into the atmosphere before being contained.\n\nFor its part, with the introduction of the EPR-2s, France has argued that it can innovate\n\nand then return to its proven \"rinse, wash, and repeat\" blueprint of success. Not everyone has faith. Since the new plan was announced during the recent French general election campaign in which Macron was seeking reelection, his political opponents pounced. And Greenpeace France, which opposes nuclear power generally, criticized Macrons faith in the EPR design. It called the new plan \"irresponsible\" and pointed out that EPR design had become an embarrassment since its launch in the late 1990s.\n\nMacron's announcement of his intention to build new #nuclear reactors is simply irresponsible.\n\nThe #EPR technology is a global fiasco, well-known for its industrial failures, decade-long delays and cost overruns.#Belfort https://t.co/BqaaNYuJgd Greenpeace (@Greenpeace) February 10, 2022\n\nGreenpeace may be wrong about nuclear power in general, but on the EPR reactor design, it has a point. The problems of the EPR program are well documented. The design, created by a partnership of EDF and Siemens of Germany, was originally meant to be a template for Generation 3 European nuclear plants. France also planned to offer EPR technology as an export in Asia and, indeed, the first EPR plant opened in China in 2019. The first attempt to build one in France, though, has gone badly awry.\n\nFlamanville 3, as plant is known, is located just a few miles south of where some of Frances 1980s vintage reactors continue to churn out reliable, clean power. Under construction since 2006, Flamanville 3 should have gone online in 2012 but has been subject to design, construction, and other delays that have seen its price tag balloon from 3 billion to 12 billion and its completion date extended over a decade to 2023. An EPR reactor under construction in Finland has faced similar problems and, due to open in 2009, only went online in March. Two more EPR plants recently broke ground in 2018 in the United Kingdom at Hinckley Point on the Irish Sea in Somerset, with cost overruns soon following. The completion date for the first of them, 2026, has not yet been officially revised. But news reports say some delay is inevitable.\n\nIn an effort to rescue the reputation of EPR plants, the Franco-German design team, consisting of EDFs nuclear division, Flamatone, and Siemens of Germany, have simplified the design. The new EPR-2 plan commits to what its designers all a \"Defense in Depth\" approach meant to cast traditional engineering assumptions aside and radically redesign them to \"over-engineer\" key components. The work is meant to address one of the main causes of pain in the original EPR design: a double containment dome that has proven difficult and terribly expensive to construct. This second dome at Flamanville 3 and other EPR sites contains not only the core but all the steam pipes that cool it, an ambitious step forward from traditional pressurized water reactor designs. Perhaps too ambitious, however, to be commercially viable, as the previously cited cost overruns demonstrate. Instead, the new EPR-2 design will massively strengthen the steam pipes, a proposal known as \"break-preclusion\" that drew condemnation from anti-nuclear activists and skepticism, at least initially, from the French regulator, ADN. That skepticism led to further redesigns and ultimately ADNs approval.\n\nTo understand the concept of over-engineering, it may be helpful to think of the Brooklyn Bridge, a revolutionary structure when completed in 1883. Its raw beauty and iconic design aside, the reason engineers marvel at the bridge is its ability to bear modern loads. Engineers like John Roebling, who designed the bridge and oversaw much of the construction, had no real idea what kind of stresses the bridge would face over the course of its life. It was setting precedent, not building upon them. As such, the bridge was built as much as 100 times stronger than necessary.\n\nAt the most basic level, this is what EPR-2 engineers are committing to, except they are doing it deliberately. The reactors coolant lines, which in the United States would be designed to \"leak before failing,\" instead will be so over-engineered that failure is highly improbably under any conceivable conditions. As one of the main potential causes of a catastrophic reactor failure, this appears to make sense. But that modifier \"highly improbable,\" will never be enough for some.\n\nIs Nuclear Making a Comeback?\n\nIf Frances reputation for nuclear competency has taken a bit of a hit with the latest designs, it remains a leading exporter of nuclear technology and know-how, and it has played a role in the construction of new Generation Three plants in China, India, and Russia, as well as the aforementioned EPR exported plants in China, the United Kingdom, and Finland. Frances struggle to templatize the EPR design, however, has not stopped other nations from launching their own new wave of nuclear plant construction.\n\nSome countries never slowed their pace, of course, including China, India, and Russia. But in the past two years, countries that had either foresworn further nuclear plant construction or seemed unlikely to reengage have reversed themselves, including the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. In announcing plans to build nuclear plants, all these nations have cited climate change as a primary motivation. After decades of dormancy, even the United States has two Generation Three nuclear plants under constructionthe Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia. And more poignantly, Japan has reversed itself and restarted plants shuttered after the Fukushima disaster.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions. Headlines have been dominated of late by Germanys high-profile decision to retire the last of its once robust network of nuclear power plants by the end of this year, despite the risks that Russia will cut Europe off amid the frictions generated by its marauding of Ukraine. And those closures have already taken their toll in the global data.\n\nStarting in 2014, significantly more nuclear capacity was added each year than subtracted globally, a sign advocates of ultra-low carbon nuclear power generation hailed as evidence that a world facing a global climate crisis was coming to its senses. As Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder, Net Zero evangelist, and nuclear energy entrepreneur told Congress in 2019, nuclear power is the only available solution that avoids the intermittency problems of renewable sources like wind and solar. \"Nuclear is the only carbon-free, scalable energy source thats available 24 hours a day,\" Gates said in testimony.\n\nAs of this writing, the revival that peaked in 2018 is being somewhat reversed, mostly by Germany. In 2021, preliminary figures from the IAEA note the retirement of three-mid-life reactors with good safety records producing 5.1 GW(e) of carbon free energy. But it also recorded the opening of six new reactors accounting for 5.2 GW(e), all of them in Asia, four of them in China. The decision in Berlin to reaffirm the axing of its three remaining plants will paint a similar story by the end of this year.\n\nAnd yet, in 2020, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)s annual report also noted that, in total, for the first time in many years the world generated slightly more from remaining and new nuclear power plantssome 5.5 GW(e) was connected to global grids that yearthan the 5.2 GW(e) that had been retired. The slight gain, the IAEA noted, \"doesnt yet constitute a trend,\" especially with the figures for 2021 still out. But it was a clear improvement over what has happened over the course of the previous decades; Globally, from a peak of 17.6 percent of global electricity production in 1996, nuclear now stands today at 6 percent of global power production.\n\nAnd it is not wishful thinking to expect that current trends might see a revival of nuclear powers fortunes. Last fall, the IAEA raised its \"upper case\" scenario for global nuclear power production by 2050 significantly, forecasting nuclear may by then be producing as much as 715 GW(e), nearly double todays total. This will give some succor to those hoping for a nuclear power revival. To be sure, that would still constitute about 12 percent of expected global electrical demand, but an energy revolution has to start somewhere. The questions, of course, are where and how.\n\nEuropes Nuclear Prospects\n\nIn Europe, the overall prospects for nuclear power are quite good. In early July this year, the European Parliament, normally a left-leaning body and previously quite hostile to nuclear power, voted to designate nuclear and natural gas as sustainable energy sources for the purposes of financial regulations. The Parliaments action remains controversial in some circlesparticularly in doggedly anti-nuclear Germanyyet it reflects a changing perception of the risk calculus surrounding nuclear power and the technology behind it.\n\nIn practice, Europes move pertains primarily to regulating the financial services sector, and its impact on the nuclear power industry will be primarily in terms of capital. In effect, listed companies involved in the industry will have a lower cost of borrowing as a result, which should incentivize further construction.\n\nOf course, criticisms abound; accusations of \"greenwashing\" (claiming to be environmentally friendly but doing the opposite) are rife. And with Europe under intense pressure to respond to the threat of a Russian gas shutdown and wean itself from its unwise reliance on Moscows whims, the rebranding of nuclear power strikes some as opportunistic, if not downright cynical.\n\nBut whatever the reason for re-regulating it now, the fact remains that the new laws are a boon to a zero-carbon nuclear energy future and could portend a new wave of deal-making by nuclear energy companies to export technology to countries where coal and other fossil fuels still represent the main sources of electrical power.\n\nOne place they likely will not matter, though, is Germany. It will push nuclear power generation from 12 percent of its needs as recently as 2020 to zero percent next year. When the extent of the risk posed by Russias stranglehold on European gas supplies became impossible to ignore last winter, some thought Germanys new government, led by the SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz in coalition with the Greens and Liberals, might revisit or at least delay its nuclear plant retirements. But revisiting the nuclear shutdown decision proved too much for a coalition that included the Greens, whose very origins lay in the anti-nuclear campaigning of the late 1970s. It also reflects a genuine and continuing aversion to nuclear power in Germany, where citizens of a certain age remember the radioactive cloud Chernobyl sent over areas of continental Europe in 1986.\n\nOf course, there were reasons beyond Chernobyl that nuclear got a bad name in Germany. The decision to walk away from nuclear power generation also has its roots with the former Social Democratic (SPD) Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, the originator of the plan to close all Germanys nuclear plants. Schroeder followed his political tenure with a decision to become CEO in the 1990s of the company that built the Nord Stream I natural gas pipeline that has ever since tethered Germany and many of its European neighbors to Russian gas supplies. For a few decades, the decision had no particular consequences despite frequent warnings from Washington and from Germanys eastern NATO allies that Moscow is not to be trusted. They were right, and Schroeder, by the way, is facing charges from Germanys public prosecutor for complicity in crimes against humanity for his close ties to Putin.\n\nGermanys ideological flexibility on green energy choices reached new levels of absurdity in early July, when the country chose to restart coal burning power plants rather than delay the nuclear shutdowns.\n\nFrance, of course, stands to be more a clear winner with the new EU regulations. It continues to outpace global trends, supplying three-quarters of its domestic demand with nuclear power and also exporting electricity to its neighbors. This summer has thrown up two new challenges for French ambitions to lead a nuclear power revival, however: record heat waves effecting the performance of its nuclear plants, and the specter of Ukraine and Russia fighting over the worlds most powerful nuclear power station at Zaporizhzhia in eastern Ukraine. Anti-nucelar activists point to both scenarios as evidence that unpredictable risks will still stalk nuclear technology regardless of how well \"lessons learned\" from places like Chernobyl and Fukushima are integrated into future designs.\n\nStart with Europes heat waves: Because of the record temperatures across the continent, the rivers that often serve as the primary source of coolant for nuclear plants are now so warm (between 28 and 30 degrees Celsius/82 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit) that they cannot safely be used to cool reactors. As a result, four reactors have been shut down until the river water cools. Combined with scheduled maintenance on a half dozen of the countrys 56 nuclear plants, this has brought French nuclear electrical output to a multi-decade low at precisely the wrong moment. Similar shutdowns and power curtailments due to river water temperatures are now in effect at Swedish, Finnish, German, and Swiss plants, and while they will end with the turning of the season, they have raised new challenges for those promoting nuclear power as a reliable technology.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant in eastern Ukraine is nothing short of extraordinary. Zaporizhzhia is a mammoth nuclear station consisting of six Soviet-designed reactors that produce 15 percent of Ukraines electricity. Captured by Russian forces in March, Moscow has turned the grounds into a missile launching platform, presumably to deter the kind of devastating counter-battery strikes that Ukraine has been using to pound Russian logistical and headquarters targets in other regions. The plant continues to operate and there are signs Russia is attempting to disconnect it from the Ukrainian grid and redirect its electrical power into Russia But Ukraine has not completely refrained from targeting missile batteries and other miliary units houses at Zaporizhzhia, raising international coverage of a nuclear meltdown sparked by an errant artillery round. Whatever the inherent dangers, the plant remains very visibly on the front line between two warring states and an object lesson about the limitations of risk planning.\n\nNuclear Power to the North\n\nDespite such setbacks, the overall trend in Europe is for expansion. Earlier this year, the Netherlands, which had previously planned to phase out its single Generation Two plant when its lifespan expired later in the decade, announced plans to spend 5 billion (about $5.2 billion) to build several nuclear plants which would come online sometime in the mid-2030s. The goal, the Dutch coalition government said in announcing the plan last January, would be to complement wind, solar and other renewables and raise the percentage of Dutch electrical power generated by nuclear higher than the current 3 percent.\n\nFrances example within the EU, even burdened as it is by fits and starts with the new EPR design, nonetheless has won regional converts. Besides the Netherlands, the Swiss, Czechs, and Poles all now have their own robust national programs to expand nuclear capacity in the name of weaning themselves both from carbon fuel and Russia. Meanwhile, Finland and Sweden, in addition to bidding for NATO membership this year, have populations strongly in favor of nuclear energy, both due to its favorable carbon profile and its ability to bolster their energy sovereignty.\n\nEarlier than most, these two Scandinavian nations saw through Moscows push to tether Europe to its natural gas reserves. So while in the 1980s, Sweden vowed to phase out nuclear power, which at one time produced nearly 40 percent of domestic electricity, the country changed course in 2009 and plans to build up to 10 small nuclear reactors, the first two just south of Gothenburg on the Baltic Sea at the site of the existing Ringals facility. The first would come online in the early 2030s.\n\nFinland also has remained a constant in nuclear power generation but has struggled with a legacy of Russian nuclear plant design and uranium supplies. Two of its older Russian-designed plants were retrofitted with Western-style containment domes following the Chernobyl meltdown in 1986. Today, the Finns produce about 30 percent of their electrical needs with nuclear power and have become known for their skill in retrofitting and upgrading existing plants, which also include Swedish designs and one reactor of the troubled Franco-German EPR design.\n\nAnd like Sweden, Finland is also studying the idea of smaller \"modular\" nuclear plants to replace and augment existing capacity. But a more pressing issue involves a plant under construction in Pyhjoki, which would be the northernmost nuclear plant in Europe if completed. Russias atomic agency, Rosatom, owns a 34 percent stake in the plant. In May, Finland cancelled its contract with Rosatom despite the construction being well under way and on target for a 2029 completion. Rosatom has said it will seek its investment back through international arbitration, although its prospects given the tight Western sanctions regime against Russia over its conduct in Ukraine are dim. Finland could likely complete the project with Western assistance, but it is also dependent on Rosatom for uranium to fuel the plants.\n\nIn fact, the legacy of Soviet and Russian involvement in nuclear power plants in Eastern and Central Europe has vastly complicated the nuclear energy infrastructure picture. Columbia Universitys Center for Global Energy Policy notes that of the 439 nuclear reactors in operation around the world in 2021, 42 are Russian designs, and 15 more, including Finlands Pyhjoki, are under construction with Russian technology. Add the 38 active plants within Russia, and this is a considerable footprint.\n\nWhats more, Russia dominates the supply and refining of uranium to fuel these and many more reactors. Columbia reports that Europe gets some 20 percent of its uranium from Russia, and the figure for U.S. nuclear reactors is 16 percent. Another 30 percent of U.S. reactor fuel comes from former Soviet states closely aligned with Moscow, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. And Russian state entities or private firms own 40 percent of global uranium conversion infrastructure and 46 percent of total uranium enrichment capacity, the report says.\n\nIn the countries of the former Soviet bloc, the dependency goes deeper than just finding another supplier. There are 18 nuclear power plants in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania calibrated to use the hexagonal fuel elements provided by Rosatom. This has placed the governments of these NATO member states in a difficult position. In May, the Czech Republic in May threw Russian contractors and Rosatom itself out of the bidding process to build a new reactor at Dukovany. In neighboring Hungary, as heavily dependent on Russian energy as any country in Europe, populist President Viktor Orban flirted with blocking nascent talks for Ukraine to join the EU if sanctions were enacted on Russiasomething a single member state can do in the EUs all for one, veto for all system. In the end, Hungary relented, but Orbans government has decided to go ahead with ongoing construction of two Russian-designed plants with Rosatoms assistance in the Danube town of Paks.\n\nEven where plants arent locked into Russian configurations of fuel, the problem of supply is tough. Thats why, despite relative unity of purpose among Europe, the United States, Japan, and other nations when it comes to punishing Russia over its behavior in Ukraine, no mention of uranium has been made by European or American leaders touting the effectiveness of Ukraine-related sanctions. Belated efforts to jump-start once common uranium mining operations in the United States, Australia, Canada, and elsewhere notwithstanding, this is not a simple as \"bringing home\" the production of N-95 masks. Uranium mining is often unpopular, and the mines have been long shuttered in communities with very mixed feeling about their revival.\n\nCan Biden Bring Nuclear Back?\n\nIn many ways, the nuclear energy picture in the United States looks like a race between those who would revive the industry in order to address climate change and the economic pressures facing the utility companies that operate the aging fleet of mostly Generation Two plants.\n\nNinety-four nuclear reactors spread among 54 nuclear power plants still operate in the United States, but that figure is shrinking. Nuclear power in GW(e) terms peaked in 2012, but the industry still meets about 20 percent of U.S. electrical needs thanks to refits that increased output in the legacy plants. That figure will begin falling quickly after 2025, as plants dating from the early 1970s reach technical exhaustion and new plants fail to materialize. A well trafficked report from the U.S. Energy Information Agency in 2014 forecast an increase of 4 percent in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions if the current rate of nuclear plant retirements went forward without either plant life extensions or new plants to replace them.\n\nEarlier this year, the administration of President Joe Bidenitself navigating difficult political straits when it comes to its embrace of nuclear powerannounced a $6 billion program of financial credits aimed at helping existing nuclear plants extend their lives beyond 2025. The first two plants targeted for such aid were the Palisades plant in Michigan and the Diablo Canyon complex in California, the last operating nuclear facility in that state. Both are Generation Two plants, and were designed in the 1960s and subject to both political opposition and economic headwinds as the price of wind, solar, and geothermal sources has dropped. In May, Entergy Corp., which runs the Palisades complex, announces its decision to decommission the plant this year, citing concerns about the aging plants components. The fate of the Diablo Canyon plant, officially due to shut in 2025, remains undecided.\n\nNuclear energy proponents, however, see hope in the two new Generation Three plants, Vogtle 3 and 4, which are nearing completion in Georgia, as well as the fact that the $1 trillion infrastructure plan that became law last November won bipartisan support despite some $25 billion in funding for nuclear and nuclear-related energy projects, including the $6 billion credits discussed above and $3.2 billion to fund the Advanced Nuclear Demonstration Program meant to create a template for future U.S. nuclear energy expansion.\n\nIt had been feared by some that Bidens fraught relationship with progressives in the Democratic Party might lead such funding to be struck from the final bill, but it wasnt. And that outcome was a first practical effect of a change in the partys official stance during the 2020 presidential election year, when the Democratic platform embraced a \"technology-neutral approach to reducing reliance on fossil fuels that included all zero-carbon technologies, including hydroelectric power, geothermal, existing and advanced nuclear, and carbon capture and storage.\"\n\nThe change of heart creates a genuine way forward in Washington to secure funding for a new round of nuclear construction, which several independent reports, including one from The Breakthrough Institute, suggest could see advanced nuclear power plants (Generation Three and Generation Four) supply as much as 48 percent of U.S. electricity demand by 2050 as the clean energy transition reaches critical mass. The costs involved could amount to as much as $1.1 trillion by mid-century, but then again, thats not much more than the $779 billion that the U.S. taxpayer would extend to the fossil fuel industry in the form of subsidies and incentives over the same period, given the current rate of $20.5 billion annually.\n\nChina As the Next Nuclear Powerhouse\n\nThe real growth story for nuclear power, as in so many other realms, lay in Asia. In 2022 so far, the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reports that 35 civilian nuclear power plants were under construction in Asia during 2022, over twice as many as in Europe, including Russia. The numbers for other continents pale in comparison; just two in North America, both in Georgia; two in South America; three in the Middle East.\n\nMany of the new Asian construction projects involve China, either because the construction is in China or is being conducted with loans and expertise from China. If Chinese President Xi Jinping is to be believed, the 19 currently under way are a down payment on 150 new reactors that are in the planning stages. As Bloomberg noted when Chinas nuclear lending program was announced at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last November, it will cost about $440bn through 2060 and aims to replace all of Chinas massively dirty coal generation capacity by that year.\n\nChinas plans carry echoes of the Messmer plan, announced by French Prime Minister Pierre Messmer in 1974 in the wake of the first Arab oil embargo, which would have seen France construct 170 reactors by 2000. Such ambitions quickly faded in the face of budget constraints and competing priorities. Nonetheless, Chinas plans cannot be so easily dismissed. The country did not complete its first nuclear plant until 1992, and yet it operates 54 today. And being late to the game has not prevented China from overtaking legacy powerhouses in other sectors. During the past 20 years, for instance, it has shot past European and the Japanese economies in terms of GDP; taken the global a lead from Germany, Japan, and the United States in manufacturing; become the leading generator of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power; and now challenges US naval supremacy in the Pacific. Underestimating China is a chumps game.\n\nBut China is not alone in pressing Asias forward in the nuclear power sphere. India operates 22 nuclear plants, mostly of Russian design, and has another nine under construction. Pakistan has a new Chinese-designed plant funded by Belt and Road Initiative money under construction to augment its current network of six. Japan, which famously vowed to retire all its nuclear plants after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, still has 33 operable plants and is now planning new construction, too, with plans now calling for nuclear to double its 40 percent share of Japanese electricity production by 2050. Two new operations are currently under construction even as the country continues restarting plants mothballed after the tsunami.\n\nIf China has a rival in Asian nuclear power production, though, it is South Korea. With 25 plants in operation and three more under construction, the country recently reversed a pledge to get out of the nuclear power business. It is also exporting its expertise, currently involved in the construction of four nuclear plants in the United Arab Emirates. President Yoon Suk Yeol, elected in May, has promised to make South Korea a \"nuclear reactor superpower,\" a sensitive topic on a crowded peninsula with a rogue state testing nuclear weapons with some regularity. Yoon has announced plans to extend the operating life of 18 of the 25 existing plants with an eye toward increasing nuclears share of electricity generation from 25 percent to 35 percent by 2030. These moves won praise from the Biden administration, which invited South Korea to participate in a US Energy Department project to develop small modular nuclear plants.\n\nNuclear Dreams and Realities\n\nBeyond Asia, the cost and complexity of nuclear energy has proven a barrier to entry. The World Nuclear Association, a global industry trade group, reports a desire for nuclear power in more than 70 countrieseverywhere from war-torn Yemen to lithium rich Chile to Ireland. But even the industrys mouthpiece admits that \"in the foreseeable future the main growth will come in countries where the technology is already well established.\"\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is a good example. Outside of two Generation Two South African plants that went into service in 1984, at the height of the Apartheid governments pursuit of a nuclear weapon, no other nation in the region operates commercial nuclear plants. South Africa, which like many African countries has faced severe power shortages over the past decade, has issued a request for proposals for future plant construction and has said it will make a decision on resulting bids by 2024.\n\nBoth Nigeria and Ghana have likewise announced they will hold similar bidding rounds. But experts believe the most likely source of new plants in Sub-Saharan Africa outside of South Africa would be China, likely through the kind of Belt-and-Road financing that has built ports, railways and other infrastructure from the Horn of Africa down to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nThats not to say nuclear energy isnt breaking new ground in the rest of the world. First-ever plants are under construction in Bangladesh and Turkey, and a two-reactor Generation Three plant of South Korean design opened in late 2021 in the United Arab Emirates. Contracts for new plants have been signed by Egypt (with Russia) and Poland (with U.S. firms Westinghouse and Bechtel). And a half dozen other nations are reported to be negotiating similar projects, including Jordan, Uzbekistan, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nNuclear Power in the Climate Change Age\n\nThe picture that emerges from a review of global developments is of an industryand a technologybeing granted an eleventh-hour reprieve from whomever or whatever it is that governs us humans. Nuclear energy wont take over the entire world fast, but it is doggedly marching forward in some places and making incremental gains in others. France, along with the United States, Russia, China, and emerging technology leaders like South Korea, appear determined to export Generation Three technologies that they say will make good on the deferred, decades-old promise of harnessing the atom to produce safe, efficient, carbon-free energy. Frances effort to leap forward with its EPR reactors shows the reality will be more difficult than the rhetoric. So complicated has this leap proven that the French government, 83 percent owner of French nuclear operator EDF, has decided to begin the process of nationalizing it to shield it from the share price hit that every setback to innovation inevitably brings.\n\nIndeed, in a few decades, the question may not be whether a private or public entity should run the show but rather whether mega-plants of the kind being built in Flamanville are the way forward. Generation Four plants will bring new ideas, among them small, modular \"micro-plants\" based on the reactors that have powered warships since the launch of the USS Nautilus in 1959. Should they take hold, Flamanville 3 and its ilk could be viewed as dinosaurs, less a great leap forward than a still-born third generation that gives way to more radical and sustainable designs.\n\nThat nuclear power will remain controversial in many circles is undeniable. Even the most fervent evangelists for nuclear power will not claim to have solved messaging around the public understanding of risk. Accidents that lead to an uncontrolled release of radiation, for instance, or what to do with their deadly byproduct, nuclear waste, are still ever-present in the discourse. Warfare like that in Ukraine which has imperiled an active nuclear power station is yet another. The main defense against charges that nuclear plants are dangerous is in risk calculus: If nuclear plants have, occasionally, threatened to cause widespread contamination and death, those outcomes have largely been avoided to date. And while deaths among nuclear power workers certainly happen, they pale when stood next to the 100,000 deaths annually in the United States alone that the National Academy of Sciences attributes to particulate matter and other pollution related to fossil fuel consumption.\n\nOpponents of nuclear power took heart when Germany refused to buckle to international pressure (and some might add, logic) and extend the life of its nuclear plants rather than address an energy crisis by burning coal. Fervent opposition to nuclear power, intermingled as it is with social activism dating to the 1960s, to anti-nuclear weapons protests and emotional pleas for a return to a simpler, more agrarian way of life, will not be dislodged easilynor with cold risk assessments, however favorable.\n\nThe conclusion of the latest chapter in nuclear power is not written, but the emergence of climate change as an existential concern has changed the game. The pro-nuclear argument has clearly gained. The relevance of nuclear power to the fight against the global climate crisis a major driver of this change, and polls tend to show that inflexible opposition to nuclear power skews older in demographic terms. It may be that the coming generation, with its unbridled faith in everything technological, can live with the atom, too.\n\nBut another factor that should not be underestimated is the convenient alignment of enemies that nuclear power creates. Breaking a nations dependence on fossil fuel import poses challenges to a democracy, but not body blows. The same cannot be said of the worlds fossil-fueled autocracies. The less natural gas imported to run turbines, the less coal to fuel power generation, the fewer dollars that flow into the Sovereign Wealth Funds of Nigerias kleptocracy, the dictators of Angola and Equatorial Guinea, the Gulf monarchies, and, of course, Russia. Calculating risk and reward, in business, in geopolitics, or in life, has spawned a cottage industry of consultants, academic programs and psychologists geared toward getting the balance just right. But adding the potential of nuclear power to lengthen the habitability of planet Earth tips the scales toward a new embrace of the atom. Seen in this larger context, nuclear power, faults and all, appears indispensable as a part of the difficult transition to Net Zero.",

                "cc_text": "IAEAs Grossi holds talks with Russia 24 November 2022 24 November 2022\n\nUkraines Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has once again lost access to external electricity and is instead relying on its emergency diesel generators for the power it needs for reactor cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on 23 November, using information provided by the IAEA staff on the site.\n\nUkraines national operator Energoatom also said that \"due to a decrease in the frequency in the power system of Ukraine at the Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyy NPPs, emergency protection worked, as a result of which all power units were automatically disconnected. Currently, they work in the design mode, without generation into the power system\". It also said that the radiation background at the NPP sites is normal.\n\nThe latest incident at the ZNPP highlights the increasingly precarious and challenging nuclear safety and security situation at Europes largest nuclear power plant, coming just a few days after it was repeatedly shelled, Director General Grossi said.\n\nOn 5 October, Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the formal transfer of ZNPP to Russian jurisdiction under Rosenergoatom. However, Ukraines Energoatom continues to claim ownership of the plant and the IAEA recognises this claim. The new Russian operating organisation of ZNPP is headed by the former chief engineer of Russias Balakov NPP, Oleg Romanenko. Since March, when Russian forces took control of the plant, the Russian national guard has been protecting the station.\n\nThe ZNPP has been disconnected from the national grid several times during the current military conflict in Ukraine, most recently in early November when it took two days to restore external power supplies.\n\nThe team of IAEA experts present at the ZNPP said it lost off-site power at 3:30pm local time on 23 November when it was fully disconnected from the grid, following reports of widespread military action targeting Ukraines energy infrastructure.\n\nInitially all the sites 20 diesel generators started operating automatically, and now eight of them are supplying the site with back-up electricity needed for all safety related equipment. The other 12 diesel generators are in stand-by mode.\n\nThe IAEA team also reported that the plants operating personnel were performing all activities according to procedures for a loss of off-site power event and that the six reactors were in a safe and stable state. The two reactors that have been in a hot shutdown mode to provide the plant and the nearby town of Enerhodar with steam and heating will be prepared for cooling down. The four others remain in cold shutdown.\n\nThe need for secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites is one of the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security during an armed conflict that the Director General outlined in March.\n\nReactors need power for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions also when they are in shutdown mode and do not produce electricity anymore. In the case of an external power loss, they have emergency diesel generators that can provide back-up electricity for a limited period of time, at least for 10 days in the case of the ZNPP.\n\nOn 22 November, an expert IAEA team had assessed the extent of damage caused by intense shelling over the previous days at ZNPP, Grossi said. They were able to confirm that despite the severity of the shelling key equipment remained intact and there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns.\n\nThe four IAEA nuclear safety, security and safeguards experts currently staying at the site were briefed by management and then conducted an extensive visit of the plant to assess first-hand the physical impact of shelling that had occurred in one of the most serious such incidents at the facility in recent months.\n\nThe status of the six reactor units is stable, and the integrity of the used fuel, the fresh fuel and the low, medium and high-level radioactive waste in their respective storage facilities was confirmed, the team said.\n\nNevertheless, the IAEA experts still observed widespread damage across the site. \"This is a major cause of concern as it clearly demonstrates the sheer intensity of the attacks on one of the worlds largest nuclear power plants,\" Grossi said.\n\nThe teams observations included damage to condensate storage tanks that caused non-radioactive leaking, several impacts on the main road along the plants reactors as well as on a site railway that is out of service, a pressurised air pipeline hit by shrapnel, two impacts on the roof of a special auxiliary building, minor visible damage to a sprinkler charging pipeline, as well as two impacts in a guardhouse area. Operating and maintenance staff have already begun repairing some of the damage and plant personnel are also cleaning up the site following the weekend attacks, the IAEA team said.\n\nOn 23 November, Grossi met a Russian delegation led by Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev in Istanbul, for consultations on operational aspects related to safety at the ZNPP and on the need to urgently establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant. The meeting was also announced by Grossi in a tweet.\n\nRussia's official TASS news agency reported that Likhachev held a regular working meeting with Grossi in Istanbul which was also attended by Rostekhnadzor chief Alexander Trembitsky. They \"discussed in detail the situation\" at and around the plant \"and the role the IAEA mission has been playing in ensuring safety there\". The IAEA's prompt reaction to massive bombardments of the power plant that took place on 20 November was highlighted and they agreed to continue their cooperation. \"They had a substantive and candid conversation.\"\n\nEarlier on 23 November, the Deputy head of the IAEA and head of the IAEA's Nuclear Energy Department, Mikhail Chudakov, told RIA Novosti that there is \"progress\" on the situation around the nuclear power plant. \"There are discussions on this topic, the leaders of other European countries are involved, which should influence the result,\" he said, without going into details. The Russian Foreign Ministry supports the creation of a security zone around the plant, but not its demilitarisation.\n\nImage: Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (courtesy of Energoatom)",

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nKYIV, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine is still under Russian control and will remain so, the Kremlin said on Monday, after a Ukrainian official suggested Russian forces were preparing to leave.\n\nThe head of Ukraine's state-run nuclear energy company said on Sunday there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to vacate Europe's biggest nuclear plant, which they seized in March, soon after invading Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin dismissed the statement.\n\n\"There's no need to look for signs where there are none and cannot be any,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing on Monday.\n\nRussia and Ukraine, which both suffered from the world's worst nuclear accident in Chornobyl in 1986, have accused each other of shelling the complex, which has six reactors.\n\nBoth sides have warned of the danger of a nuclear catastrophe. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, wants to create a protection zone around the plant.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said late on Sunday that he had no doubt Russian forces would leave the plant, where Ukrainian staff are still working.\n\n\"The defence line is starting to retreat to the borders of the Russian Federation,\" Podolyak told Ukrainian television, adding that Ukraine would take the plant back.\n\nUkraine's military said last week that about 30 Russian servicemen had been wounded near Enerhodar, the town closest to the plant. Reuters was not able to immediately verify the reports.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin moved in September to annex Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, which Russian forces partially control. Kyiv and its Western allies condemned the move as illegal.\n\nWriting by Lidia Kelly and Kevin Liffey; editing by Philippa Fletcher\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
