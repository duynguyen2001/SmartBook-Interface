# How could the EU's price cap of $60 per barrel impact the global oil market, particularly in terms of supply, demand, and pricing?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The EU's price cap on Russian oil, alongside a potential overcompliance by companies, could lead to a significant reduction in global oil supply, potentially driving up prices worldwide <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. However, if Russian oil continues to flow to some markets below the cap, the anticipated supply shock and subsequent price surges may be mitigated, balancing supply and demand <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

The EU's ban on Russian seaborne crude, along with the G7's implementation of a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil, aims to reduce Russia's oil revenue without causing a global price shock by keeping Russian oil flowing to some markets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, the effectiveness of the price cap is uncertain, as Russia has been selling oil at a discount and has threatened to cut off supplies to nations enforcing the cap <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Analysts are concerned about the potential removal of Russian oil from the global market, which could tighten supply and drive up prices, affecting global demand and pricing dynamics <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Additionally, the possibility of overcompliance by companies, avoiding dealings with Russian oil even under the cap, could further reduce supply and impact prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This complex situation leaves the impact on Canadian oil stocks and other global oil buyers unclear, as they navigate the new pricing landscape <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The implementation of a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil by the EU, G7 nations, and Australia is creating uncertainty in the global oil market, with potential effects on supply and pricing <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This measure, which coincides with an EU ban on most Russian oil imports, is designed to undercut Russia's oil revenues without causing a supply shock by permitting Russian oil to continue flowing to markets that do not adhere to the embargo <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The Kremlin's response, stating it will not sell oil to countries enforcing the cap, even if it means cutting production, could lead to a reduction in the global supply of Russian oil <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. This situation is complicated by the fact that major shipping and insurance firms are based in the G7 countries, which could make it challenging for Russia to sell its oil above the cap <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The effect of the price cap on actual oil flows and prices remains to be seen, as Russian seaborne exports and production have not shown significant decreases so far <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. However, the cap could lead to overcompliance, where traders and insurers may avoid dealing with Russian oil altogether, potentially causing a major drop in its global availability and possibly driving up prices for all <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Analysts also highlight that oil markets are expected to remain volatile due to other factors, including COVID-19 developments in China and central bank policies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. If the supply of Russian oil is substantially reduced and global energy prices increase, this could pose problems for the G7's strategy; however, if Russian oil supply diminishes without a corresponding rise in global prices, the price cap would not be problematic from the G7's perspective <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The price cap is meant to curb profits Russia makes on its oil exports to finance the war in Ukraine. However, analysts and policymakers are uncertain as to what effect the cap will have on oil prices, especially since Russia has been selling oil at a discount believed to be about $48 per barrel. The Kremlin has warned it will not trade any oil at all with nations that implement the price cap.|

Those are: a European Union boycott of most Russian oil and a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian exports imposed by the EU and the Group of Seven democracies. It is not yet clear how much Russian oil the two sanctions measures could take off the global market, which would tighten supply and drive up prices. The world's No.|

G7 nations, the European Union and Australia agreed Friday to impose a price cap of $60 a barrel on Russian oil shipped to other countries that have not adopted an embargo. The move, which also takes effect Monday, is aimed at depriving the Kremlin of revenue while avoiding a price shock by keeping Russian oil flowing to some markets. Moscow has previously threatened to retaliate by cutting off oil supply to countries that adhere to the price cap.|

In the case of the price cap, overcompliance would look like traders, insurers, or shipping firms refusing to deal with Russian oil even if its sold for a price below the cap. The result could be a major drop in the supply of Russian oil available on the global market, which could increase prices for everyone. (Of course, if the supply of Russian oil is squeezed but global energy prices do not increase, that would not be a problem from the perspective of the G7.)|

Last week, members of the G7 and European Union bloc of nations decided to implement a US$60 price cap on crude oil exported from Russia. Will this new cap have any impact? What does it mean for Canadian oil stocks?|

It allows Russian oil to be shipped to third-party countries using G7 and EU tankers, insurance companies and credit institutions, only if the cargo is bought at or below the price cap. As the world's key shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the cap could make it difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price. Russia, which is the world's second-largest oil exporter, said on Sunday it would not accept the cap and would not sell oil that is subject to it, even if it has to cut production.|

This is the root of a policy coming into effect todaya price cap on Russian oil. This policy is a way for the international community to apply economic pressure on Russias main source of revenue, energy earnings, while also ensuring the global energy market remains well supplied. As the risks Russia poses have evolved, so too has our need to assess those risks.|

The market was also weighing the production impact of a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian crude imposed by Group of Seven (G7) nations, the European Union and Australia. So far there is a "lack of an impact on Russian flows", said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler. "Russian seaborne exports and production are just not dropping.|

Concern that an outright ban on Russian crude imports could send oil prices soaring, however, prompted the G-7 to consider a price cap on the amount it will pay for Russian oil. No formal agreement has yet been reached, although Reuters reported Thursday that EU governments had tentatively agreed to a $60 barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil. "The other factor OPEC will need to consider is indeed the price cap," Galimberti said.|

In addition, these trends could prompt more attempts by buyer markets to introduce additional market management measures. For example, the EUs proposed gas price cap risks unnatural interference in markets that could have an array of consequences for the global gas trade if eventually introduced in some form.
