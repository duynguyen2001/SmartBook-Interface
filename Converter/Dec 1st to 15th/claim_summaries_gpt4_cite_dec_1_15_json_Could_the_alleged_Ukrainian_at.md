## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Ukrainian strikes on Russian air bases far from the frontlines suggest a strategic shift towards long-range precision attacks that challenge Russian military capabilities and demonstrate Ukraine's ability to escalate the conflict on its own terms <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. This shift entails not only a military challenge for Russia but also potentially affects the strategic calculus of both Russian and Western leadership, considering the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and the implications for the broader conflict dynamic <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Recent Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian air bases suggest a potential strategic shift, as they demonstrate Ukraine's capability and willingness to conduct long-range, high-precision attacks deep within Russian territory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. These strikes have repeatedly caught Russian forces off guard, indicating a possible escalation of the conflict and a challenge to Russian military and political plans <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The deployment of advanced Patriot defense systems, as proposed, could further alter the dynamic of the war, enhancing Ukraine's air defenses against Russian missile and drone attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Moreover, the vulnerability of Russian strategic sites to drone technology could influence Western perceptions of Russia's nuclear threats and have immediate tactical implications on the battlefield in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Recent alleged Ukrainian strikes on Russian air bases, including ones far from the frontlines, have the potential to mark a strategic shift in Ukraine's military approach, suggesting an ability and willingness to carry out long-range precision attacks on Russian territory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. These operations have repeatedly caught Russian forces off-guard, from the sinking of the Moskva cruiser to the Saky air base and Sevastopol attacks, indicating a pattern of Ukrainian forces demonstrating their expanding capabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The strikes on airfields hundreds of miles inside Russia, not directly claimed by Ukraine but hinted at by Ukrainian officials, have shown that Ukraine can escalate the conflict on its terms, possibly altering the Kremlin's military and political calculations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>This shift in strategy also poses a serious challenge for Russia, both militarily and politically, as it showcases Ukraine's ability to target strategic sites and disrupt Russian military operations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The attacks, such as those on the Engels and Ryazan air bases, which house aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons, have immediate battlefield implications and could change Western perceptions of Russian threats <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The lack of Ukrainian official acknowledgment does not diminish the significance of these strikes, which could be part of a larger Ukrainian strategy to extend the war's scope and compel a reassessment of Russia's military objectives and capabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

## Claims
| Claim Sentence | Source | Context |
|---|---|---|
|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> On December 5, two Ukrainian strikes on Russian air bases deep into Russian territory and far from the frontlines produced a painful shock for Russian forces and could signify a further mutation, if not escalation, of the war.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://blogs.prio.org/2022/12/as-ukraine-conducts-deep-strikes-russia-turns-to-iran/" target="_blank">blogs.prio.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 14th, 2022</div></div>| On December 5, two Ukrainian strikes on Russian air bases deep into Russian territory and far from the frontlines produced a painful shock for Russian forces and could signify a further mutation, if not escalation, of the war. Each time Ukrainian forces deliver a long-range high-precision attack from the sinking of the Moskva cruiser in mid-April 2022 to the strike on Saky air base in Crimea in early August and the swarm attack of air and naval drones on Sevastopol in late October Russia has been caught unprepared and has struggled to find a response.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> These attacks represent a serious military challenge for the Kremlin but are also politically convenient.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/times-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/putins-new-strategy-to-win-the-propaganda-war-over-ukraine-invasion-kk52d9j83" target="_blank">The Times</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Long-range Ukrainian drone strikes on air bases hundreds of miles inside Russian territory on Monday and Tuesday demonstrated that Kyiv was willing and able to escalate the war on its own terms. These attacks represent a serious military challenge for the Kremlin but are also politically convenient. They reinforce President Putins new message: that this is a national, patriotic struggle for the survival of the Motherland in which there can be no bystanders or backsliders.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> US officials believe Putin is belatedly realizing something that has been blindingly obvious those outside the cocoon of sycophancy in the Kremlin: Russia lacks the military means to accomplish its political ends in Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bloomberg-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-12-14/is-putin-finally-getting-smart-about-his-ukraine-disaster" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 14th, 2022</div></div>| Ukraine and Russia both face key decisions that could reshape the conflict diplomatically and militarily. Perhaps the most worrying possibility for Ukraine, and for the US, is that Russian President Vladimir Putin will finally start showing the strategic smarts he has demonstrated in the past. US officials believe Putin is belatedly realizing something that has been blindingly obvious those outside the cocoon of sycophancy in the Kremlin: Russia lacks the military means to accomplish its political ends in Ukraine.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Doing so would mark an upgrade of existing Ukrainian air defenses, which were in action again today as Russian drones targeted the capital, Kyiv, for the first time in weeks.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bloomberg-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-12-14/war-for-ukraine-s-skies-set-to-enter-new-phase" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 14th, 2022</div></div>| The war for control of Ukraines skies is taking a new, and dramatic, turn, with a proposal to deploy advanced long-range Patriot defense systems. US President Joe Biden must still approve the supply of the systems that Ukraine has long sought to protect against Russian missile and drone assaults on cities and energy infrastructure. Doing so would mark an upgrade of existing Ukrainian air defenses, which were in action again today as Russian drones targeted the capital, Kyiv, for the first time in weeks.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Aside from the symbolism of striking airfields linked to Russias nuclear deterrent, the attacks may have immediate effects on Moscows strategy on the battlefield in Ukraine.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/06/ukraine-drones-russian-airfield-attacks/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 6th, 2022</div></div>| Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly alluded to his countrys vast nuclear arsenal, making veiled threats that he is prepared to resort to extreme measures to deter Western involvement in the war or as retaliation if Ukraine targets critical infrastructure inside Russia. The vulnerability of strategic sites to relatively simple drone technology may change the way Western leaders perceive these threats. Aside from the symbolism of striking airfields linked to Russias nuclear deterrent, the attacks may have immediate effects on Moscows strategy on the battlefield in Ukraine. "In the practical sense, this is a serious and imminent problem for the Russian Defense Ministry," Ruslan Leviev, an analyst with Conflict Intelligence Team, said in a daily video briefing.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The government in Kyiv has ruled out conceding any land to Russia in return for peace.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.fbcnews.com.fj/world/zelenskiys-talks-with-other-leaders-signal-diplomatic-flurry-around-ukraine/" target="_blank">fbcnews.com.fj</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| There are no peace talks and no end in sight to the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two, which Moscow calls a "special military operation" and Ukraine and its allies an unprovoked act of aggression. Moscow shows no signs of being ready to respect Ukraines sovereignty and pre-war borders, saying the four regions it claims to have annexed from Ukraine in September are part of Russia "forever." The government in Kyiv has ruled out conceding any land to Russia in return for peace. On the ground in Ukraine, the entire eastern front line has been continuously shelled with heavy fighting taking place.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility, but officials have jokingly suggested its military may be behind the incidents.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukrainian-drone-attacks-russia-airbases-kursk-putin-war-what-it-means-rcna60276" target="_blank">NBC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Similar explosions were seen on Monday at the Engels air base outside the city of Saratov and at Ryazan, just 125 miles southwest of Moscow and hundreds of miles away from the Ukrainian border. The Engels base houses Russia's strategic bombing fleet of tu-160 and tu-95 planes, which have been used on long-range bombing missions to Ukraine and can be adapted to carry nuclear weapons. Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility, but officials have jokingly suggested its military may be behind the incidents. Russias defense ministry blamed Kyivs forces for the two blasts Monday, in which it said three "maintenance personnel" died and two planes were damaged.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> But he also said that Russia had become bigger by annexing Ukrainian territory.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/07/world/russia-ukraine-war-news" target="_blank">The Daily </a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Dec 7th, 2022</div></div>| That has prompted fears that the Kremlin might announce another wave at any moment. On Wednesday, Mr. Putin appeared to acknowledge that the war, which began in February, is taking much longer that the Kremlin had expected. But he also said that Russia had become bigger by annexing Ukrainian territory. "This is a significant result," Mr. Putin said, referring to his move in September to declare four Ukrainian provinces part of Russia, a move that has been condemned as illegal by Ukraine and its international allies.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> Kyiv has not yet commented on this latest possible attack.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Center" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 6th, 2022</div></div>| Russia blamed Kyiv for the attacks but Ukraine has not publicly commented on the incidents. On Tuesday morning, the governor of Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, said there was a "drone attack" near an airfield in the region. Kyiv has not yet commented on this latest possible attack. The claimed Kursk attack followed other, similar blasts at Russian bases, some of which have been located hundreds of miles within Russia, well beyond the range of any prior Ukrainian attacks.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> The Ukrainian Defense Ministry has offered no official comment on the explosions, and the Ukrainian government has not acknowledged adding long-range attack drones to its arsenal.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="Left" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/europe/ukraine-drone-russia-air-base-attacks-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 5th, 2022</div></div>| The Russian Defense Ministry says the strikes on two air bases Monday followed by an attack on an air field Tuesday were carried out by Ukrainian drones, which it claims were brought down by Russian air defenses. Imagery, both satellite and photographs, indicates some damage was done to Russian military planes at one base in Ryazan region. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry has offered no official comment on the explosions, and the Ukrainian government has not acknowledged adding long-range attack drones to its arsenal. However, a top Ukrainian official has tweeted a cryptic message hinting at the possibility that Kyiv was indeed behind the attacks.|
