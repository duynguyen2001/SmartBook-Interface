# What is the impact of the shelling on the operational status and safety of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The shelling has jeopardized the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant's operational status by damaging transmission lines and forcing reliance on diesel generators to prevent meltdown, increasing the burden on operators and the risk of losing grid connection <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Additionally, the safety of the plant is compromised by Russian military activities, including the placement of Grad rocket launchers near spent fuel storage areas, elevating the risk of nuclear and radiation hazards <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is at risk due to shelling that has disrupted connections to the Ukrainian grid, necessitating reliance on diesel generators to prevent meltdown, which adds pressure on the workforce and the generators that are only meant for temporary backup <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The safety of the plant is further compromised by Russia's placement of Grad rocket launchers near the facility's spent nuclear fuel storage, posing a risk of shelling across the Dnieper River and using the plant as cover, which violates nuclear safety regulations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Shelling in the surrounding areas, like Nikopol and Chervonohryhorivka, has damaged residential buildings and power lines, indicating the broader impact of military actions near the plant <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Additionally, the persistent targeting of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure by Russia, which has included the Zaporizhzhia plant's region, exacerbates the risk to the nuclear facility <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently operational and connected to the Ukrainian grid, faces significant challenges to its safety and operational status due to ongoing hostilities. Shelling has previously damaged transmission lines, forcing the plant to rely on diesel generators to maintain its critical cooling systems, which are designed only for temporary backup. This reliance on generators poses a risk of meltdown should the connection to the grid be severed again, increasing the burden on the plant's operators and potentially overstretching the generators <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Moreover, the presence of Russian military hardware, including Grad rocket launchers positioned dangerously close to the plant's spent nuclear fuel storage, compounds the risks by potentially violating nuclear and radiation safety regulations and escalating the chance of a catastrophic incident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The shelling has had broader implications for the surrounding areas as well, with attacks damaging residential buildings, power lines, and critical infrastructure near the plant. In the Zaporizhzhia region, shelling has affected the communities of Nikopol and Chervonohryhorivka, leading to power outages and damage to more than 10 houses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The continuous targeting of civilian infrastructure by Russian forces, which includes the Zaporizhzhia plant, is part of a broader strategy that has been condemned by Ukraine and the West. This strategy appears aimed at reducing morale, causing civilian suffering during winter, and pressuring the Ukrainian government <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The operational challenges at the Zaporizhzhia plant thus reflect both a direct threat to nuclear safety and a component of the wider conflict's impact on Ukraine's civilian population and infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The Zaporizhzhia plant is currently connected to the Ukrainian grid, but there have been times the transmission lines have been brought down by shelling, forcing the power station to fall back on diesel generators to keep the cooling system running and prevent the reactor vessel from meltdown.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/safety-of-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-hangs-in-the-balance" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 12th, 2022</div></div>| But keeping reactors in this hot standby mode is a difficult and delicate process, adding to the burden on the operators. The situation could get worse still. The Zaporizhzhia plant is currently connected to the Ukrainian grid, but there have been times the transmission lines have been brought down by shelling, forcing the power station to fall back on diesel generators to keep the cooling system running and prevent the reactor vessel from meltdown. If the connection to the grid was severed again, it would add to the pressure on the overstretched workforce and on the generators, which were only designed as a temporary backup.|
