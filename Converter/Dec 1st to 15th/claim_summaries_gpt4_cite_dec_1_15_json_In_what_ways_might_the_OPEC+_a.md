<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The OPEC+ alliance's decision to maintain current production levels amidst the imposition of a $60 price cap on Russian oil by the G7 and EU could potentially exacerbate market uncertainties by tightening supply and affecting global oil prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. As Russia, part of OPEC+, refuses to sell oil under the price cap, even at the cost of reducing its production, the alliance's output policies will be crucial in determining the balance between supply and sanctions-driven demand shifts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

The OPEC+ alliance, which includes Russia, decided to maintain current production levels amidst the implementation of a $60 price cap on Russian seaborne oil by the G7 and the EU's embargo on Russian crude by sea <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This decision comes as the group assesses the effects of Western sanctions on Russia's oil revenue and the global oil market's reaction <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The price cap, enforced by G7 nations and Australia, allows for the use of their shipping, insurance, and credit institutions only if Russian oil is purchased at or below the cap, potentially complicating Russia's ability to sell oil at higher prices <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Russia's response to not sell oil under the cap, even if it means reducing production, could lead to increased competition among Russian producers and with other global suppliers, affecting global oil prices and availability <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

The OPEC+ alliance, which includes major oil-producing countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, has decided to maintain its current oil production levels amid the imposition of a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil by the G7 nations, the EU, and Australia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. This decision to preserve output levels comes at a crucial time as Europe's ban on importing Russian oil by sea and the new price cap on Russian oil are set to take effect, aiming to limit Moscow's revenue from oil exports without causing a global price shock by ensuring some Russian oil continues to flow to the markets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. <br/><br/>Russia has responded to the Western price cap by stating it will not sell its oil to countries adhering to this cap, even if it means reducing its production, which may lead to a tightening of the global oil supply <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The OPEC+ group's decision to stick with its current production targets could potentially amplify the effects of the Western sanctions on the global oil market, as it could result in further supply constraints, especially if Russia cuts back its oil exports in retaliation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The interaction of these two factors—OPEC+'s production policies and the Western price cap—could, therefore, contribute to increased volatility and upward pressure on oil prices in the near term <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> It is not yet clear how much Russian oil the two sanctions measures could take off the global market, which would tighten supply and drive up prices.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/first-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/04/1140629951/opec-keeps-oil-targets-the-same-amid-uncertainty-on-russian-sanctions" target="_blank">Up First</a></div><div>*(Podcast)*</div><div>Dec 4th, 2022</div></div>| The decision at a meeting of oil ministers Sunday comes a day ahead of the planned start of two measures aimed at hitting Russia's oil earnings in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Those are: a European Union boycott of most Russian oil and a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian exports imposed by the EU and the Group of Seven democracies. It is not yet clear how much Russian oil the two sanctions measures could take off the global market, which would tighten supply and drive up prices. The world's No.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> The Western actions have left Russian producers in fierce competition with each other and with suppliers from Asia, Europe and the Middle East, meaning their best hope of finding buyers is to lower prices, two traders said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russian-oil-sold-india-below-price-cap-buyers-market-2022-12-14/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 14th, 2022</div></div>| Also on Dec. 5, the Group of Seven leading economies implemented a $60 price cap on Russian seaborne oil to try to limit Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine. Russia has said it will not abide by the cap even if it has to cut production. The Western actions have left Russian producers in fierce competition with each other and with suppliers from Asia, Europe and the Middle East, meaning their best hope of finding buyers is to lower prices, two traders said. Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February, India has become the main outlet for seaborne cargoes of Urals crude.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> As the world's key shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the cap could make it difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters-fact-check-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/g7-price-cap-russian-oil-kicks-russia-will-only-sell-market-price-2022-12-05/" target="_blank">Reuters Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 5th, 2022</div></div>| The price cap, to be enforced by the G7 nations, the European Union and Australia, comes on top of the EU's embargo on imports of Russian crude by sea and similar pledges by the United States, Canada, Japan and Britain. It allows Russian oil to be shipped to third-party countries using G7 and EU tankers, insurance companies and credit institutions, only if the cargo is bought at or below the price cap. As the world's key shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the cap could make it difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price. Russia, which is the world's second-largest oil exporter, said on Sunday it would not accept the cap and would not sell oil that is subject to it, even if it has to cut production.|

|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The move, which also takes effect Monday, is aimed at depriving the Kremlin of revenue while avoiding a price shock by keeping Russian oil flowing to some markets.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-12-04-22/h_9cddb659f5f02e708ae64fc4e884dfed" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 4th, 2022</div></div>| Europe's ban on importing oil from Russia shipped by sea kicks in on Monday, injecting extra uncertainty into the outlook for energy supply. G7 nations, the European Union and Australia agreed Friday to impose a price cap of $60 a barrel on Russian oil shipped to other countries that have not adopted an embargo. The move, which also takes effect Monday, is aimed at depriving the Kremlin of revenue while avoiding a price shock by keeping Russian oil flowing to some markets.

|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> However, other analysts said that the impact of the cap on Russian oil prices could be minimal or nonexistent, cautioning that it remains too early to tell how U.S. gas prices will respond.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/abc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/cap-russian-oil-send-gas-prices-rising/story?id=94480014" target="_blank">ABC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Global oil prices face other headwinds like an OPEC Plus decision to preserve output at current levels that could further strain supply as well as the potential lifting of COVID lockdowns in China that may boost demand. Taken together, these factors could send U.S. gasoline prices up as much as 25% over the next three weeks, Krishnamoorti warned. However, other analysts said that the impact of the cap on Russian oil prices could be minimal or nonexistent, cautioning that it remains too early to tell how U.S. gas prices will respond. "Consumers don't necessarily need to be worried about an imminent shockwave," Patrick de Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told ABC News.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The policy aims to strike a balance between maintaining a reliable global supply of oil and hindering Russias oil revenues.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/12/us-matches-eu-60-price-cap-on-russian-crude-oil-delivered-by-sea" target="_blank">morganlewis.com</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| As part of a more coordinated multilateral approach to sanctions, the G7 (the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom) and Australia agreed to adopt the $60 per barrel cap proposed by the European Union.

The policy aims to strike a balance between maintaining a reliable global supply of oil and hindering Russias oil revenues. OFAC expects the price cap to be particularly relevant to emerging markets and low-income economies that are susceptible to rising energy prices.|
