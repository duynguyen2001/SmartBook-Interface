<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is seeking to establish a permanent presence at Ukrainian nuclear plants to ensure they are not used as weapons of blackmail, with a formal application from Ukrainian authorities supporting this initiative <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. To enhance the safety of its staff, the IAEA is pushing for the creation of a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia plant, amidst discussions of not shooting at or from the facility and the withdrawal of heavy weapons and Russian soldiers as conditions for protection <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is seeking to ensure the safety of nuclear power plants in Ukraine amidst the ongoing conflict, particularly at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has been under Russian control since shortly after the invasion <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The IAEA is pushing for the creation of a security zone around the ZNPP to prevent it from being targeted or used for military purposes, a proposal that has seen "positive dynamics" in discussions with Russian officials according to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The agency's Director General, Rafael Grossi, has stated the importance of protecting the facilities, which includes not shooting at or from them, and has met with President Putin to discuss the matter. The Ukrainian authorities have also requested a permanent IAEA presence at their nuclear plants to prevent their use as weapons of blackmail in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Ensuring the safety of the IAEA's staff while stationed at these plants in a conflict zone involves complex negotiations and the establishment of clear terms for the protection of the facilities. Grossi hopes to reach an agreement with both Russia and Ukraine by the year's end to protect the ZNPP <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The IAEA's role is recognized as crucial in moving forward and ensuring the physical and nuclear safety of the plants <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, Russian officials have stated that the ZNPP is on Russian territory and that they are capable of ensuring its safety, indicating challenges ahead for the IAEA's objective to demilitarize the area around the nuclear plant <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. French President Emmanuel Macron has underscored the importance of preventing escalation around civilian nuclear power and the need to apply pressure on Russia to return to negotiations, highlighting the international dimension of the IAEA's efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

The interviewer cited Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba as saying ZNPPs protection depends on the withdrawal of heavy weapons and Russian soldiers. Grossi replied: "The withdrawal of armaments from the plant is what, understandably from their point of view, the Ukrainians ask.|

Zaporizhzhia is Europe's largest nuclear power station and has been under Russian control since shortly after the invasion. The U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency is trying to establish a safety zone around the plant because while nuclear power plants are built to withstand many natural disasters, few are designed to survive direct military attacks, said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists. An attack on the plant could potentially release intense radiation in a small area and weaker radioactive particles over a wider area.|

"Nobody expected that someone could capture a nuclear plant This situation absolutely pushes us to rethink what we should do from the point of view of safety," Galushchenko told AFP.
