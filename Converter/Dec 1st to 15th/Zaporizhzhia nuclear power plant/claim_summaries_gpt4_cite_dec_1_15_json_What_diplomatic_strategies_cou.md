<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Efforts by the IAEA to establish a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are crucial to ensure nuclear safety, but require backing from negotiations and pressure on Russia by influential countries, as discussed by French President Emmanuel Macron and local Ukrainian officials <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Meanwhile, Western powers must consider future security arrangements and guarantees for Russia to incentivize its return to the negotiating table, as suggested by Macron and supported by diplomatic strategies that avoid premature ceasefires <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The safety concerns at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have escalated tensions between Western powers and Russia, with the UN atomic energy agency emphasizing the urgency of demilitarizing the area. However, efforts to establish a security zone around the plant have been hindered by stalled talks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Amidst the shelling of towns near the plant and accusations from Kyiv that Moscow is using the facility as a weapons depot, there have been calls for a permanent International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presence to prevent the site from being exploited as a weapon of conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The IAEA has been actively seeking an agreement with both Russia and Ukraine to ensure the plant's protection, with Director General Rafael Grossi aiming for a resolution by the end of the year <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Diplomatic strategies to prioritize nuclear safety could involve providing assurances to Russia post-conflict, as suggested by French President Emmanuel Macron, although this approach has sparked controversy in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Furthermore, discussions on creating a security zone have shown some "positive dynamics," according to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. In addition to Macron's proposal, the IAEA's potential role as a neutral presence at the nuclear plants could serve as a foundation for negotiations, with the agency's staff ensuring that the facilities are not used for military leverage <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. There also appears to be a willingness from Moscow to negotiate control over the plant, potentially using it as a bargaining chip for transit guarantees, which could lead to a diplomatic opening if substantiated <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.
