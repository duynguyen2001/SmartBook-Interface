## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is working to create a demilitarized and protected security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to safeguard it during the conflict, with ongoing negotiations despite challenges from Russian officials <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Access to the plant by the IAEA has been negotiated to assess safety conditions, indicating the potential of diplomacy in ensuring nuclear security even in wartime, though efforts to demilitarize the area have been met with resistance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is working closely with the Ukrainian government to establish a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a proposal aimed at protecting the facility from the ongoing conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Despite Russian officials casting doubt on the idea, the IAEA has managed to extend its access to the plant for an additional 120 days to assess safety conditions, highlighting the role of diplomacy in managing war-related risks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. However, proposals for a demilitarized zone have faced setbacks, with the Russian Foreign Ministry's response suggesting a lack of agreement on the establishment of such a protected area <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The urgency for IAEA intervention is underscored by local reports of shelling near the plant and accusations of the site being used as a weapons depot, which compounds the risk and necessitates international efforts to secure the facility <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), working closely with the Ukrainian government, is striving to establish a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been under Russian control since early in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Ukrainian officials, including Dmytro Kuleba, have been in constant communication with IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, who is actively seeking to broker a deal to safeguard the facility and its vicinity <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Despite the challenges, the IAEA has managed to gain access to the plant for inspection and to assess the safety of the Ukrainian staff, who are reportedly being held by Russian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. However, the proposal for a demilitarized zone has faced setbacks, with Russian officials casting doubt on the feasibility of such an initiative <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The IAEA's efforts to create a protected zone are critical, given the frequent shelling in the area, which has heightened the risk of a nuclear accident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest nuclear power station, is not designed to withstand direct military attacks, and an attack could potentially release significant radiation <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The situation has led to alarm from Western powers and the UN atomic energy agency, with talks to demilitarize the area stalling <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Nonetheless, Grossi remains committed to reaching an agreement to protect the power plant, hopefully by the year's end, demonstrating the IAEA's dedication to mitigating the risks of a nuclear incident amid the ongoing conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

Through its own diligent negotiations with both Moscow and Kyiv, the UNs nuclear watchdog agency has obtained access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to help ascertain the safety of the facility, where Russia holds the Ukrainian staff hostage and has established a military base. This record demonstrates the power of diplomacy to mitigate the damage of war, and even to end it, but also the need to ensure that expectations for what it can accomplish are realistic. Experience to date offers no reason to think that if the right formula, or the right mediator, is found, the conflict might end.|
