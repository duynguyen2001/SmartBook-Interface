The Engels and Dyagilevo air bases hold significant strategic value within the Russian military infrastructure as they are key facilities for Russian strategic aviation, housing squadrons of Tu-95MS and Tu-160 bombers that are used to launch cruise missiles into Ukraine from a considerable distance <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The fact that Engels air base was struck represents the first-ever direct hit on an element of Russia's strategic triad, which is crucial for the country's national security, marking a substantial escalation in Ukraine's ability to target high-value assets deep within Russian territory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. These attacks demonstrate gaps in Moscow's reconnaissance and air defense and highlight the vulnerabilities of Russia's military infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The strikes on these bases, far from the Ukrainian border, also underscore Kyiv's capability and willingness to escalate the war on its terms and challenge Russian military strength <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Engels and Dyagilevo air bases are significant within the broader context of Russian military infrastructure due to their role in housing strategic aviation assets, specifically squadrons of Tu-95MS and Tu-160 bombers. These bombers have been utilized to launch cruise missiles at Ukraine from a distance, such as over the Caspian Sea, marking Engels as a pivotal element of Russia's strategic triad and a key component in the nation's security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The air bases' locations, hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border, demonstrate their strategic importance in projecting Russian military power and the ability to operate at great distances from the front lines, which has been highlighted by recent Ukrainian drone strikes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Ukrainian strikes on these bases not only reveal vulnerabilities in Russian reconnaissance and air defense but also have significant military and political ramifications. Militarily, they challenge Russia's perceived security of strategic assets deep within its territory and politically, they serve to bolster Ukrainian morale while exposing Russian defense weaknesses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The attacks on Engels and Dyagilevo, which have been described as long-range and unprecedented, underscore the evolving dynamics of the conflict, as Ukraine demonstrates its capability to escalate actions and strike high-value targets within Russia, thereby shifting the narrative of the war and affecting Russian confidence <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

The strikes were reportedly carried out using a modified Soviet-era unmanned aerial vehicle called the Tu-141 Strizh. The attacks on the air bases were a significant blow to Kremlin, as they marked the first time Ukraine had conducted such long-range strikes inside Russia. However, the Ukrainians did not stop there.|
|<div style="max-width: 200px;"><span class="anchor" id="2"></span><font  color=#FF3399>[2]</font> What is particularly significant about the strike on the Engels air base is the fact that it is a major facility for Russian strategic aviation, and as such, many Moscow commentators have emphasized the first-ever direct hit on an element of the strategic triad, pivotally important for national security (Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 7).</div>|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 150px; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><ClientOnly><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></ClientOnly></a><div><a href="https://blogs.prio.org/2022/12/as-ukraine-conducts-deep-strikes-russia-turns-to-iran/" target="_blank">blogs.prio.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 14th, 2022</div></div>| Using these capabilities for attacks deep within Russian territory, the Ukrainian command takes care to target military bases and assets, in sharp contrast with indiscriminate Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and residential areas. For instance, the Khalino airfield near Kursk, where the fuel depot was hit on December 6, used to be a civilian facility, but since the start of the war, it has been used exclusively for military purposes (Svoboda, December 6). What is particularly significant about the strike on the Engels air base is the fact that it is a major facility for Russian strategic aviation, and as such, many Moscow commentators have emphasized the first-ever direct hit on an element of the strategic triad, pivotally important for national security (Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 7). The squadrons of Tu-95MS and Tu-160 bombers based in Engels (which appear to be a rare observers of a sadly dilapidated locale) are constantly used for launching cruise missiles on Ukrainian territory from a safe distance usually over the Caspian Sea, which veils the misfiring missiles making it a legitimate target for Ukrainian retaliation (Novayagazeta.eu, December 7).|

Earlier this week, several people were killed in explosions at two Russian military airfields. Russia accused Ukraine of using a drone to strike Russian targets hundreds of kilometers from the border at Engels Airport in the Saratov region and Dyagilevo Airbase in Ryazan. The Russian Defense Ministry stated that drone attacks had killed three people, adding that the drones were "shot down as they flew in at low altitude," and the resulting explosions led to some superficial aircraft damage.|

Some estimates hold that as much as half of the force that attacked on 24 February is dead, incapacitated or off the battlefield for other reasons. Ukraines long-range attacks on high value targets in Crimea and deep within Russia proper, including early December strikes on the Engels and Dyagilevo air bases (which host strategic bombers hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border), reveal gaps in Moscows reconnaissance and air defence. Kyiv is confident that it is on a path to liberate ever more of its land.|

These attacks represent a serious military challenge for the Kremlin but are also politically convenient. They reinforce President Putins new message: that this is a national, patriotic struggle for the survival of the Motherland in which there can be no bystanders or backsliders.|

Last month, UK defence officials said the Russian military was using two plants in occupied Mariupol to produce large numbers of "dragon's teeth" - concrete blocks designed to slow advancing enemy armour and other vehicles. The city is strategically important for Russia, forming part of its "land bridge" linking Russia to annexed Crimea.|

Russias defense ministry blamed Kyivs forces for the two blasts Monday, in which it said three "maintenance personnel" died and two planes were damaged. Analysts were cautious about the military impact of the apparent attacks on strategic sites far from the front lines, but said they had further undermined Russian confidence in the country's air defenses while providing a timely morale boost for Ukrainian civilians preparing for a long winter under bombardment. "The signaling is important for the Ukrainians: They need to know that they are hitting back, given the amount of pain and devastation and general discomfort thats being meted out in Ukraine," Matthew Ford, an associate professor at the Swedish Defense University in Stockholm, told NBC News.|

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Ukraine used drones to attack two Russian military airfields on Monday morning, adding that its air defenses intercepted the attacks "in the Saratov and Ryazan regions," according to a statement carried on the official Russian news agency RIA Novosti. The two bases, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, are hundreds of miles inside Russian territory and beyond the reach of Ukraines declared arsenal of drones. No footage or images of the remnants of drones have been published.|

Ukraine, on the other hand, apparently inflicted damage on the Russian bases where some of those aircraft were launched. Explosions shook two different Russian airbases, Engels and Dyagilevo, earlier today. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) claimed that Ukraine used converted Soviet-era Tu-141 jet-powered unmanned aerial vehicles to prosecute the attacks, but that the drones were intercepted by Russian air defenses.|
