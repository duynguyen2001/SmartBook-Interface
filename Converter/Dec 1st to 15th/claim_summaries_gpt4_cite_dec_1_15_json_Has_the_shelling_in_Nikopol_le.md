## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Ukrainian forces are constrained from returning fire on the Russian artillery units stationed around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, to avoid the risk of a nuclear disaster, despite the intensified shelling of the city of Nikopol <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Despite the increased Russian force density and shelling in the region, there are no reported changes in the Ukrainian military's defensive or offensive postures, as they continue to endure the barrages without direct retaliation to protect the nuclear facility <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
The Ukrainian military has not returned fire against Russian forces in Nikopol due to the proximity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the risk of triggering a nuclear disaster, despite the area being subject to intense shelling <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The shelling has not weakened the Ukrainian public's resolve to continue fighting, as evidenced by a survey where 86% of Ukrainians agreed that the country should fight on <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, the increased number of Russian troops in the Zaporizhzhia region following their withdrawal from Kherson has led to intensified shelling in the area <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The Ukrainian-held towns in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, including Nikopol, have faced continuous attacks from evening till morning, yet no changes in the Ukrainian defensive or offensive postures have been explicitly reported <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The city of Nikopol, located in southern Ukraine across the Dnipro river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, has been subjected to daily Russian bombardment. The Russian military has positioned their artillery units around the nuclear facility, which has complicated the Ukrainian military's response options. Ukrainian forces have expressed that they cannot return fire due to the risk of triggering a nuclear disaster, which has led to a significant change in their defensive posture in the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. As a result, the population of Nikopol has decreased by more than half since the onset of hostilities, as residents flee the constant shelling and the threat of a nuclear incident <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Despite the shelling, there have been no reports of the Ukrainian military altering their offensive posture in the area. The Ukrainian forces continue to hold their positions, enduring "from evening till morning" shelling attacks from Russian forces stationed at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. While the region has seen an increase in Russian force density, and shelling has intensified, the Ukrainian military appears to maintain its current strategy without engaging in actions that could escalate the situation around the nuclear plant <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Additionally, Ukrainian public opinion remains steadfast in the face of bombardment, with a survey indicating a strong resolve to continue fighting, which likely influences the military's continued defense efforts without a shift in offensive actions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Ukrainian forces say they cannot return fire for fear of causing a nuclear disaster.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20221207-live-soldiers-among-16-dead-in-donetsk-road-crash-pro-russia-officials-say" target="_blank">france24.com</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 7th, 2022</div></div>| The city of Nikopol in southern Ukraine lies just across the Dnipro river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, exposed to daily Russian bombardment and unable to return fire. Home to 115,000 people before the war, Nikopol has lost more than half its population since Russian forces took over the nearby nuclear plant in the first days of fighting, placing their artillery units around the facility. Ukrainian forces say they cannot return fire for fear of causing a nuclear disaster. And for those left behind in Nikopol, life in the city has become a misery.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Shelling has intensified ever since, Dadak and his soldiers said.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fact-checker-washington-post-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/03/after-kherson-ukraines-military-ponders-new-push-south-east/" target="_blank">Washington Post Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 3rd, 2022</div></div>| The ground is even muddier than in the Kherson region, Dadak said. And, after abandoning Kherson city, Russia redistributed its troops to the east, boosting its presence in Zaporizhzhia. Shelling has intensified ever since, Dadak and his soldiers said. Russias force density has increased, Muzyka said, meaning it has more troops per square mile than it had at the start of the war.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> While a Western about-face would greatly damage Ukraines war effort, and it might even change Kyivs cost-benefit calculations concerning negotiations, it would probably not make Ukrainian public opinion more conciliatory especially since, at this point, the Russian missile barrages do not seem to be weakening resolve.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine/b96-answering-four-hard-questions-about-russias-war-ukraine" target="_blank">crisisgroup.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 8th, 2022</div></div>| Even if shifts in domestic politics or economic pressure were to bring about a change of heart in Western capitals, which right now seems unlikely, the violence in Ukraine would not necessarily end. Nor would the region necessarily experience greater stability. While a Western about-face would greatly damage Ukraines war effort, and it might even change Kyivs cost-benefit calculations concerning negotiations, it would probably not make Ukrainian public opinion more conciliatory especially since, at this point, the Russian missile barrages do not seem to be weakening resolve. (An October survey found that 86 per cent of Ukrainians agree that their country should fight on in the face of bombardment.)|
