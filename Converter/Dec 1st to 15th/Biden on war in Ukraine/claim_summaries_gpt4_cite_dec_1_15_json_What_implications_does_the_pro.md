## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The proposed Ukrainian law to ban religious organizations affiliated with Russia could exacerbate tensions by potentially inflaming religious and cultural divides, which may hinder peace negotiations and complicate US and European efforts to support Ukraine while deterring further Russian aggression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This move also reflects the broader geopolitical struggle, as the US and its allies seek to uphold international norms and reinforce the consequences of violating sovereignty, which are central to their interests in the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The arguments against a peace that would leave Russia in control of some Ukrainian territory are tied to a broader international goal of providing negative reinforcement to deter aggression, reflecting a stance shared by the United States and Ukraine, among others <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. US interests in Ukraine, while aligned with Ukraine's sovereignty, are not identical to Ukraine's goals, and the US, along with European allies, has significant influence over the conflict due to their support in terms of weapons, financial, and humanitarian aid <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. President Biden's stance on the conflict, describing it as "sick" and advocating for Putin to "pull out" of Ukraine, underscores the US's commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty and indicates that talks with Russia would only occur if Putin shows a genuine interest in ending the war <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Similarly, France's firm support for Ukraine, as expressed by President Macron, emphasizes the importance of upholding international principles for the stability of the global order, which aligns with US interests and the broader international community's stance against the Russian invasion <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The proposed Ukrainian law to ban religious organizations affiliated with Russia reflects the broader conflict's intricate dynamics and the emphasis on sovereignty and national security. The punitive aspect of deterring Russian aggression by reinforcing the norm against attacking sovereign nations is a shared goal of the United States and many other countries, as it seeks to prevent future territorial infringements <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Moreover, the law is a manifestation of resisting cultural and ideological influence, echoing President Putin's own statements about Ukraine's alignment with Western values, which he opposes, and his critique of the West's acceptance of LGBTQ+ communities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. This resistance to Russian influence aligns with US interests, which include upholding the foundational principles of the international order, such as territorial integrity and democracy, as well as the US's commitment to supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia's illegal war of aggression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The US's interests, while aligned with Ukraine's, are not necessarily identical, and the complex interplay of domestic support and international law becomes apparent <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The United States and its allies, such as France, have publicly condemned Russia's actions and pledged continued military, economic, and humanitarian support to Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. This support is critical not only for Ukrainian sovereignty but also for the stability of the global order, underscoring the significance of adherence to international norms and laws <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The proposed law and the broader conflict also have implications for US policy, as they necessitate a strategic approach to managing great-power rivalries and reinforcing alliances to deter future conflicts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Thus, the US's engagement in the conflict, while principled on democratic values and international law, is also a strategic endeavor to maintain global stability and deter aggression <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

The most common one involves a goal shared by the United States and Ukraine and many other countries: giving Russia a big dose of negative reinforcement for invading its neighbor. This punishment could deter Russia from repeating such aggression and deter other countries from aggression by reinforcing the norm against attacking sovereign nations (even if, awkwardly, the United States has violated that norm which is also an international law more than once in recent decades). Obviously, pushing Russian troops back to pre-2014 lines (Zelenskys stated goal) or even pre-February lines, would be a powerful form of negative reinforcement and the more powerful the better.|

Lastly, Xis aggressive marginalization of political opposition will likely eliminate checks on his authority, leaving China more vulnerable to the potentially disastrous consequences of his hubris. Thus, the return of great-power hubris is evident, and it has significant policy implications for the United States. US policymakers need to relearn the art of "bloodletting"a term coined by international relations theorist John Mearsheimer to describe a strategy "by which a country increases the costs to its rival by making a conflict in which that rival is involved more difficult."|

Because it seems to me that while U.S. interests are aligned with Ukraine's, they are not necessarily identical. And the United States or Germany or France or Great Britain, EU writ large, could decide that liberating Crimea or seeking to simply raises a prohibitive risk to Europe writ large, maybe even the globe. And given that the United States and European countries are providing weapons, arms as well as financial humanitarian support to Ukraine, they have the wherewithal to shape influence the decisions Ukrainians make.|

Biden added that he had no immediate plans to contact Putin, but is "prepared to speak" with the Russian leader "if in fact there is aninterest in him deciding he'slooking for a way to end thewar he hasn't done that yet." He continued, "If that's the case, inconsultation with my French andmy NATO friends, I'll be happyto sit down with Putin to seewhat he wants, has in mind.He hasn't done that yet.In the meantime, I think it'sabsolutely critical whatEmmanuel [Macron] said.We must support the Ukrainianpeople."|

Firm US support, Macron also relayed, "is very important, not just for the Ukrainians but for the stability of our world today. Because if we consider that we can abandon the country and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means that there is no possible stability in this world," pledging France's own increased military, economic, and humanitarian support. The French president's trip to the White House alongside his spouse, Brigitte Macron, marks their second time as the guests of honor for a state visit, having first done so during Donald Trump's administration in 2018.|

According to Human Rights Watch, the new law would also "isolate children from any information on alternative sexual orientation and gender identity, including gender transition." Putin has made no secret of the fact that his assault on Ukraine was partly motivated by Kyivs desire to align itself more closely with the Western world and its values. Alluding to Western acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, he accused the West of "imposing attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature."|

Western sanctions did not produce the quick crash in the ruble or the broader Russian economy that some expected. However, their impact could mean a stagnant economy in the longer term, and they threaten to cause particular problems in the energy sector and other sectors that depend on high-tech inputs imported from the West. Moscow does not appear to have handy answers to these problems.|

By "encouraging" the "re-shoring" of semiconductor manufacturing to the US by offering state subsidies (national security trumps free trade, but of course this is only valid for US national security), the US will eventually hollow out Taiwan's economy. This will reduce the incentive for China to take over Taiwan (China has plenty of pineapples already), while at the same time increase Taiwan's economic dependence on China (they need to sell their pineapples to somebody, now that they don't have semiconductors to sell).|

"But whats at stake here is whether or not the foundational principles of the international order will be upheld. That includes freedom of the people of Ukraine for their territorial integrity and for their democracy." Chorev also insisted that, while doing everything possible to support Ukraine, the US had worked equally hard to mitigate the wider consequences of the war and the food and fuel crises, and to stop the war spreading.|

They also condemn and reject Russias illegal attempted annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, in clear violation of international law.|
