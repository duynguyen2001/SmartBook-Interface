Taking Bakhmut could serve as a gateway for Russian forces to move toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, indicating a deeper push into the region (1,4).

Moreover, controlling Soledar could provide new locations for Moscow's forces to place artillery, increasing the pressure on Ukrainian defenses in Bakhmut (3).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the fall of Soledar does not guarantee the collapse of Ukrainian defenses in the Donetsk region, nor does it ensure a strategic withdrawal by Ukrainian forces (5). The Institute for the Study of War emphasizes that control of Soledar will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut (10). Additionally, the heavy casualties resulting from the war of attrition may render a Russian victory as costly as a defeat, suggesting that the battle for Bakhmut, even if Soledar is taken, will be far from decisive (1)."

The recent history of Ukrainian counter-offensives regaining territory, including the successful recapture of land in the northeast and withdrawal from Kherson, suggests a potential for Ukraine to launch strategic counter-attacks following the Soledar situation (4,5).",
                "summary": "The battle for Soledar has been intense, with Russia claiming to have captured the town, a claim that Ukraine denies (2,3). The town's strategic value lies in its potential to help Russian forces encircle Bakhmut and advance from the north, which could alter the dynamics of the conflict in the region (1). Given the Ukrainian armed forces' denial of Soledar's capture and their recent successes in counteroffensives, such as the recapture of territory in the northeast and the orderly withdrawal from Kherson (4,5), Ukrainian defense strategies may continue to focus on containing Russian advances and reclaiming occupied areas. Moreover, with General Surovikin's shift of Russian military tactics to a more defensive stance (4,5), Ukrainian forces might adapt their strategies to exploit the current stalemate and further consolidate their defenses while preparing for potential counter-offensives.",
                "more_detailed": "The situation in Soledar has been marked by competing claims over control, with Russia announcing the capture of the town, a claim Ukraine denies, amid fierce ongoing fighting (7). Despite Russian assertions, capturing Soledar is seen as having minimal strategic military significance; however, it would provide Moscow's forces, specifically the Wagner mercenary group, with new positions to pressure Ukrainian defenses and potentially encircle Bakhmut from the north, putting pressure on Ukrainian supply lines (8,10). The town's fall would allow Russian forces to focus more on Bakhmut, which has been a significant target since the summer, but even then, the overall trajectory of the war is not expected to be altered significantly by the capture of Soledar or Bakhmut (10).\n\nIn response to the situation in Soledar and the possibility of Russian advancements, Ukraine is rearming for a planned counter-offensive to reclaim territory (9). The United States, a key ally, and other analysts maintain that even if Soledar and Bakhmut were to fall, it would not have a strategic impact on the war, nor would it impede the Ukrainian counter-offensive efforts (9). Consequently, Ukrainian defense and counter-offensive strategies might see a continuation of their current trajectory, focusing on strengthening their positions and preparing for future operations to push back Russian forces, without allowing the situation in Soledar to dictate a significant shift in their overall military strategy (9)."

The continuous bombardment and potential encirclement of Bakhmut, if Soledar falls, could further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis, with civilians trapped and facing intensified hostilities (8).\n\nIn the long term, the civilian population of Soledar and nearby regions may face a worsening global food crisis, as the war's impact on Ukraine's infrastructure makes it increasingly difficult to provide essential supplies during the winter season (1). The loss of trust in societal institutions due to the spread of conspiracy theories and anti-state messages, as well as the potential threats to life and constitutional stability, could undermine the region's social fabric and governance structures for years to come (5). Furthermore, the area's strategic insignificance suggests that even if control changes hands, the overall trajectory of the war may not shift, potentially leading to a prolonged conflict with continued civilian casualties and disruption of normal life (7,9,10)."

These losses, predominantly of former prisoners, suggest that the Wagner Group may need to replenish its forces, which could impact their ability to sustain offensive operations and influence Russian military tactics (4). The importance of taking Bakhmut, which could be made more precarious by the fall of Soledar, has been downplayed by experts like Michael Kofman, who argue that the outcome may not justify the high cost to Russia (1,2). Furthermore, the significant number of Wagner personnel deployed in Ukraine, including convicts, points to a strategy that might increasingly rely on high-risk, high-casualty operations that could prove as deadly for Russia as a defeat (1,4).",
                "more_detailed": "The heavy casualties sustained by the Wagner Group in Soledar could have significant implications for future Russian military tactics. The high number of casualties, including those among recruited convicts, indicates a costly war of attrition that may affect the Wagner Group's operational capabilities and necessitate replenishment of its forces (4). With over 1,000 Wagner personnel reported dead in a month, and a strategy that has led to a high number of casualties being observed on the ground, the tactics employed by the Wagner Group may need to be reevaluated to mitigate such heavy losses in future operations (8). \n\nFurthermore, the toll on the Wagner Group, which is a significant component of the Russian offensive, contributes to the overall degradation of combat power and cumulative exhaustion of Russian forces (9). This attrition may force a strategic reassessment, as even small territorial gains are proving to be enormously costly. The battle for Soledar itself is described as potentially a Pyrrhic victory for Russia, implying that the heavy losses could make subsequent military endeavors more challenging and potentially unsustainable (10). Analysts suggest that the capture of Soledar will not have a strategic impact on the broader war due to the disproportionate costs associated with such gains (7,9)."

Should Russian troops indeed capture the town, it would mark Moscow's first gain in the Donbas for months potentially offering President Vladimir Putin some welcome news after a string of defeats on the battlefield since last summer. The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal. However, its capture would allow Russian forces, and especiallythe Wagner mercenary group, to turn their focus on nearby Bakhmut, which has been a target since the summer. The town of Soledar in Donetsk has been a target for Russian forces since last May. With a pre-war population of about 10,000, it has little strategic value in itself, but is a waypoint in the Russians' attritional slog westwards. Moscow has struggled for months to attack Bakhmut from the east, but were it to capture Soledar, Moscow would at least be able to approach the city from a different path. The Russian armed forces have had nothing to celebrate since the beginning of July, and have had to retreat in both Kharkiv to the north and Kherson in southern Ukraine. The capture of Soledar, despite its now-ruined state, would therefore be rare progress. But it would be symbolic rather than substantive. The Institute for the Study of War said control of Soledar \"will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut,\" the larger prize. But Soledar is of outsize significance to one man: oligarch and Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin. His Wagner fighters, many of them former prison inmates, have taken heavy casualties with one wave after another of ground assaults across what has become a battlefield of trenches and mud reminiscent of World War I. After months in which the Russian Ministry of Defense has delivered nothing but retreat, Prigozhin is keen to show that his men deliver. Read more about Soledar here.",

Some context: On Thursday, the Wagner group disparaged claims from the Russian ministry of defense that its forces were involved in the Soledar offensive. For their part, Ukrainian officials have repeatedly contested claims that Soledar has been taken.

                "cc_text": "MOSCOW -- Russia's top military officer was put in charge of troops fighting in Ukraine on Wednesday, a move that appears to reflect the Kremlin's dissatisfaction with the current leadership and flaws in the military's performance.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said that Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian armed forces, was named the new commander of the unified group of forces in Ukraine.\n\nThe previous commander, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, was demoted to become Gerasimov's deputy along with two other generals.\n\nThe reshuffle, which was formally ordered by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, clearly came on Russian President Vladimir Putin's approval, signaling that he still has trust in his top military leaders who have faced broad criticism for the troops' performance in the conflict.\n\nIt also suggests a recognition of flaws in carrying out what Putin called \"the special military operation\" in Ukraine.\n\nWhile announcing Gerasimov's appointment, the Defense Ministry said it was aimed at improving coordination between various forces fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"Raising the level of leadership of the special military operation is linked to the expansion of the scale of the tasks being fulfilled as part of it and the need to organize closer interaction between branches of the military and to increase the quality of supplies and the efficiency of directing groups of forces,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nSurovikin was credited with strengthening coordination and reinforcing control over Russian forces in Ukraine after his appointment in October. His demotion to the No. 2 role signaled that while Putin wasn't quite happy with his performance, he still trusts the general's expertise.\n\nSoon after Surovikin was appointed, Russian troops pulled back from the southern city of Kherson under the brunt of a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The retreat from the only regional center captured by Russia since it sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 came weeks after its annexation by Moscow and dealt a painful blow to the Kremlin.\n\nUnder Surovikin, the Russian military largely switched to a defensive mode, allowing it to reduce the military failures that had characterized the first half year of the war. He was able to conduct an orderly retreat from the southern city of Kherson, the only Ukrainian provincial capital captured by Russian forces in nearly a year since the invasion.\n\nBut Surovikin, who earned a reputation for ruthlessness in Syria, also launched waves of missile and drone attacks intended to cripple the Ukrainian energy grid as winter set in. The strategy seemed intended to demoralize Ukrainian civilians and erode the will to fight.\n\nHis replacement with Gerasimov was met with derision from some nationalist Russian military bloggers, who have compared the reshuffle to a game of musical chairs among Moscow's ineffectual military old guard. The bloggers have become increasingly vocal in recent weeks in calling for an overhaul of Russia's approach to war to protect its shrinking gains in Ukraine against an increasingly well-armed and well-trained opponent.\n\n\"The sum does not change, just by changing the places of its parts,\" a prominent military blogger, who posts on the Telegram messaging app under the name of Rybar, wrote.\n\nGerasimov's critics included Yevgeny Prigozhin, a millionaire businessman with close ties to Putin. Prigozhin, whose Wagner Group military contractor has played an increasingly prominent role in the fighting, has accused Gerasimov of incompetence and blamed him for a string of Russian military setbacks.\n\nSuch criticism was also shared by Chechnya's leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, who deployed troops from his region to fight in Ukraine and repeatedly urged the Kremlin to up the ante in the conflict.\n\nThe criticism of Gerasimov from Prigozhin and Kadyrov rose to a high pitch in September, when Russian troops were forced to pull back from Ukraine's northeastern region of Kharkiv by a swift Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nKadyrov particularly accused Gerasimov of covering up for his protege, Col. Gen. Alexander Lapin, who was in charge of the troops that retreated from the Kharkiv region.\n\nDespite such attacks, Lapin was promoted to become the chief of staff of ground forces earlier this week. His promotion along with Gerasimov's new appointment appear to signal that Prigozhin and Kadyrov have little influence over the Kremlin's decision-making despite their increasing public activity.\n\nPutin on Wednesday also gave a televised dressing down to Denis Manturov, a deputy prime minister in charge of aviation and other high-tech industries.\n\nPutin demanded that Manturov act more quickly in contracting new aircraft and cut him short during a televised video call with Cabinet members when he tried to defend his performance.\n\nWhen Manturov said he would try to make sure it's done during the first quarter, Putin angrily snapped that it should be done within a month. \"You don't try to do all you can, you do it within a month, no later than that,\" Putin said.\n\nATTACK ON SOLEDAR\n\nThe fate of a devastated salt-mining town in eastern Ukraine hung in the balance Wednesday in one of the bloodiest battles of Russia's invasion, while Ukraine's unflagging resistance and other challenges prompted Moscow to shake up its military leadership again.\n\nRussian forces used jets, mortars and rockets to bombard Soledar in an unrelenting assault.\n\nSoledar's fall, while unlikely a turning point in the nearly 11-month war, would be a prize for a Kremlin starved of good battlefield news in recent months. It would also offer Russian troops a springboard to conquer other areas of Donetsk province that remain under Ukrainian control, such as the nearby strategic city of Bakhmut.\n\nDonetsk and neighboring Luhansk province, which together make up the Donbas region bordering Russia, were Moscow's main stated territorial targets in invading Ukraine, but the fighting has settled mostly into a stalemate.\n\nOn the battlefield, a Ukrainian officer near Soledar told The Associated Press the pattern is that first the Russians send one or two waves of soldiers, many from the private Russian military contractor Wagner Group, who take heavy casualties as they probe the Ukrainian defenses. When Ukrainian troops suffer casualties and are exhausted, the Russians send a fresh wave of highly-trained soldiers, paratroopers or special forces, said the Ukrainian officer, who insisted on anonymity for security reasons.\n\nUkrainian officials denied Russian claims that Soledar had fallen but the Wagner Group's owner repeated the assertion of a breakthrough late Wednesday.\n\n\"Once again I want to confirm the complete liberation and cleansing of the territory of Soledar from units of the Ukrainian army,\" Yevgeny Prigozhin wrote on his Russian social media platform. \"Civilians were withdrawn. Ukrainian units that did not want to surrender were destroyed.\" He claimed about 500 people were killed and that \"the whole city is littered with the corpses of Ukrainian soldiers.\"\n\nUkraine's military said late Wednesday Russian forces had suffered \"huge losses\" in the Soledar fighting.\n\nThe AP was unable independently to verify either side's claims.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stopped short of declaring the municipality's capture, telling reporters Russian forces had achieved \"positive dynamics in advancing\" in Soledar. \"Let's not rush, and wait for official statements,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy weighed in Wednesday in his nightly video address: \"Now the terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that some part of our city of Soledar -- a city that was almost completely destroyed by the occupiers -- is allegedly some kind of Russia's achievement.\" He said Ukrainian forces in the area are holding out against the Russians.\n\nSoledar, known for salt mining and processing, has little intrinsic value but it lies at a strategic point six miles north of the city of Bakhmut, which Russian forces want to surround.\n\nTaking Bakhmut would disrupt Ukraine's supply lines and open a route for the Russians to press toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk province.\n\nSoledar's fall would make \"holding Bakhmut much more precarious for Ukraine,\" Michael Kofman, the director of Russia Studies at the CAN nonprofit research group in Arlington, Va., noted.\n\nThe war of attrition, with heavy casualties, may make a Russian victory as deadly as a defeat.\n\n\"I don't think the outcome at Bakhmut is that significant compared to what it costs Russia to achieve it,\" Kofman said in a tweet.\n\nThe Wagner Group, which now reportedly includes a large contingent of convicts recruited in Russian prisons and constitutes up to a quarter of all Russian combatants in Ukraine, has spearheaded the attack on Soledar and Bakhmut.\n\nDelivering victory in Soledar and Bakhmut after months of Russian frontline difficulties would help Prigozhin, who has criticized Gerasimov, increase his clout in what has emerged as somewhat of a rivalry with Russia's military leadership.\n\nRussian troops have struggled to gain control over Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and another Ukrainian province the Kremlin illegally annexed in September, after incorporating the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. When Russian forces withdrew from Kherson, the battle heated up around Bakhmut.\n\nPutin identified the Donbas region as a focus from the war's outset, and Moscow-backed separatists have fought there since 2014. Russia captured almost all of Luhansk during the summer. Donetsk escaped the same fate, and the Russian military subsequently poured manpower and resources around Bakhmut.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said Russian forces were up against \"concerted Ukrainian resistance\" around Bakhmut.\n\n\"The reality of block-by-block control of terrain in Soledar is obfuscated by the dynamic nature of urban combat ... and Russian forces have largely struggled to make significant tactical gains in the Soledar area for months,\" the Washington-based think tank said.\n\nAn exceptional feature of the fighting near Bakhmut is that some has taken place around entrances to disused salt mine tunnels, which run for some 120 miles, according to Western intelligence reports.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Vladimir Isachenkov, Andrew Meldrum, Monika Scislowska and Yuras Karmanau of The Associated Press and by Anatoly Kurmanaev of The New York Times.\n\nUkrainian soldiers watch smoke rising from the embattled salt-mining town of Soledar in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, where one of the bloodiest battles of the war has been taking place.

Lets wait for official announcements,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said while describing a \"positive dynamic in advances\" in Soledar.\n\nMeanwhile, a separatist leader hailed Soledars \"takeover\" as a step towards gaining full control of Donetsk, parts of which have been occupied by pro-Moscow rebels since 2014.\n\n\"This is a groundbreaking moment,\" Denis Pushilin told the NTV television network. \"We are preparing the moment weve been waiting for, the liberation of the Peoples Republic of Donetsk.\"\n\nTo other pro-Kremlin Russians, Soledar is a devastating Ukrainian loss of manpower and a personal defeat for Kyivs commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi.\n\n\"Zaluzhny never counted losses anyway, but here, he exceeded himself by herding thousands of soldiers to die or be captured,\" Herman Kulikovsky, a popular Russian military analyst, wrote on Telegram on Wednesday.\n\n\"Actually, the Wagner troops didnt just destroy a significant part of Ukrainian forces who attempted to keep Soledar but also distracted a part of the forces, reserves and most importantly the attention of Ukraines General Staff from other front lines,\" he wrote.\n\n\"If there is no Soledar, there is no Ukraine,\" pro-Kremlin publicist Zakhar Prilepin said on Telegram.\n\nThe town is certainly key to seizing Bakhmut.\n\nBut whats under and around it also offers an explanation as to why Wagners Prigozhin is so desperate to control the town and monopolise its takeover in the eyes of the Kremlin.\n\nThe salt mines under Soledar contain a major military prize, huge depots of firearms dating back to World War II.\n\nSalt absorbs water and prevents rust, and Moscow began loading the mines with Nazi trophy weaponry and hundreds of thousands of Soviet small arms in the late 1950s, according to Nikolay Mitrokhin, a historian with Germanys Bremen University.\n\n\"Thats why the Ukrainian military deployed a battalion of special forces there in the spring of 2014 and defended the mines from the Donetsk [separatist] militias thronging at the gates,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe depot may not have been fully evacuated because its lift cannot bring more than a dozen crates to the surface at a time, he said.\n\nSoledars salt could be just as valuable.\n\nThe town, whose name means \"a gift of salt\", once provided up to 40 percent of the Soviet Unions edible salt.\n\nBefore the war, it supplied about 90 percent of salt in all of Ukraine, and hostilities around the town caused a spike in prices.\n\nThe towns environs are also rich in alabaster, valuable clay for ceramics and coal.\n\nAnd Prigozhin is known for having business interests that go far beyond maintaining a private army.\n\nHis fighters are understood to have cut their teeth in Syria, helping President Bashar Assad regain most of the war-torn nation.\n\nThen Evro Polis, a company Prigozhin controls, signed a deal to develop Syrian oil- and gasfields and restore energy infrastructure, according to Russian and Western media reports.\n\nSome Wagner units relocated to the war-scarred Central African Republic and helped Prigozhin gain control of the lucrative trade in \"blood diamonds\", according to the France-based All Eyes on Wagner research group.\n\nApart from Soledar, the southeastern region of Donbas is Ukraines treasure trove of mineral riches, metallurgical and chemical plants.\n\n\"Donbas is rich in raw materials, and its industrial complex could also be utilised,\" Aleksey Kushch, a Kyiv-based analyst, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"I think a far more valuable prize is at stake a place in Russias political hierarchy,\" Kushch said, referring to Prigozhins ambitions to gain more clout within the Kremlin.",

While Gerasimov was a key figure in planning the invasion, he appears to have been at arms length since, with just one reported visit to the command of the campaign inside Ukraine, though the Defense Ministry did not confirm that either.\n\nJust why the Russian Defense Ministry has made this move at this moment is unclear. It said there was a \"need to organize closer interaction between the branches and arms of the Armed Forces\" and improve the support and effectiveness of \"command and control of groupings of troops.\"\n\nSome analysts believe the move may be an attempt by the ministry to exert tighter control over the campaign ahead of a critical few months in which the remainder of the reserve force mobilized in the autumn of 2022 will be deployed after training.\n\nA Russian military analyst who blogs under the pseudonym Rybar, and has more than a million followers on Telegram, does not expect the shake-up to be successful suggesting its hoping for \"a miracle in the 11th month of the special operation.\"\n\n\"The sum does not change by moving around its parts,\" Rybar wrote.\n\nRead more:",

Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight Russia has escalated its assault in the area in recent days, unleashing savage fighting that has underscored the high cost of the battle. Russian mercenaries and released convicts from the Wagner group pushed into the neighboring salt-mining town of Soledar and inched closer to Bakhmut, the capture of which has eluded them for months despite an advantage in firepower and the willingness to sacrifice troops.\n\n\"When we kill five out of 10 of their soldiers at once, they are replenished again to 10 over the course of several hours,\" said Andriy Kryshchenko, a deputy battalion commander of a national guard unit posted to the south of the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Although they storm in small groups, people are constantly replenished, which creates an opportunity for them to storm positions very often sometimes five, six, seven times during the day,\" Kryshchenko said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military must now decide how many more forces and how much more ammunition and weaponry it can expend to continue defending Bakhmut a city that many military analysts view as having relatively little strategic significance to the broader battlefield, but which has become freighted with political symbolism for both sides.\n\nThe decisions come as Ukrainian officials awaiting an influx of new armored vehicles promised by the United States, France and Germany say they are preparing to launch a new counteroffensive in the coming months to try to wrest back more territory from the Russians. Success in that campaign would be critical for President Volodymyr Zelensky to demonstrate continued momentum on the battlefield and retain domestic and international support in a war now in its eleventh month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They need to have units out of combat that they are equipping and training up for this offensive,\" said Michael Kofman, a Russian military analyst at Virginia-based CNA. \"This is why Bakhmut is a battle that I think was advantageous to Ukraine, but now there are questions about how much the cost of fighting for Bakhmut could impede Ukraines overall strategy for this winter or spring.\"\n\nStarting in mid-2022, Wagner leader Yevgeniy Prigozhin set his sights on capturing Bakhmut to show the Kremlin that, unlike Russias beleaguered military, which was retreating from positions, his private mercenary army remained capable of taking initiative and capturing new territory on the battlefield.\n\nMany military analysts viewed the move as strategic folly, watching as the Russians suffered grave losses, wasting droves of primarily mercenary and ex-convict troops, as well as ammunition and weaponry, in pursuit of a city with relatively little strategic significance for the wider war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ukrainians for months seemed to be succeeding in causing Russian attrition over a questionable target. Moscow has thrown tens of thousands of troops into the fight, according to a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military details, and has lost thousands of those men in the battle for Bakhmut.\n\nBut in recent weeks, the Ukrainian city that once housed 70,000 people has become imbued with additional political symbolism on both sides. For the Russians, its capture would allow Moscow to tout a much-needed victory and claim momentum in a war in which its forces havent captured a major city since last summer. For the Ukrainians, Bakhmut has been trumpeted by officials as a \"fortress\" and an icon of a superhuman resistance, making even a calculated retreat politically fraught.\n\nZelensky visited the city late last year and in a subsequent speech to Congress, compared it to the Battle of Saratoga, the turning point of the Revolutionary War. He presented a flag signed by defenders of the city to Vice President Harris and then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Ukrainians regularly repeat the slogan, \"Bakhmut holds,\" as the latest sign of unwavering resistance in the face of a brutal Russian war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine is under pressure to launch a new counteroffensive in coming months and fend off any new campaigns by a Russian force buttressed with newly mobilized soldiers at a time when attrition is testing its reserves of trained fighters and ammunition.\n\nThe top general in the United States, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark A. Milley, said in November that Russia and Ukraine had each seen about 100,000 of their troops killed or wounded since the start of the conflict in February 2022, a staggering toll that underscores the challenges posed by a war of attrition.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe United States and its allies have approved new military aid for Ukraine in recent days, preparing to ship armored fighting vehicles designed to help Ukrainian forces in a new campaign. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday that the fierce fighting around Bakhmut showed \"how vital it is that we step up our support, our military support to Ukraine.\"\n\nTop Ukrainian military officials regularly emphasize that trained and motivated fighters are the most precious resource in Kyivs arsenal, taking pains to plan operations to ensure the fewest losses possible. But Bakhmut has become a brutal slog, as Russia dumps thousands of fighters on the front, testing Ukrainian forces with wave after wave of personnel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Ukrainian commander, who recently fought in the city and spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid about the battle, described \"great losses\" within his unit.\n\n\"As for the symbolism, to each his own,\" the commander said. \"But we have lost many friends in the defense of this city, so we do not want to surrender it now. But maybe a temporary withdrawal would save some of our people.\"\n\nAndriy Miheychenko, the 42-year-old commander of a unit in Ukraines 53rd Mechanized Brigade, who was fighting in Bakhmut until late December, described the Russian mercenary fighters as a \"cheap resource\" dying in very large numbers while proving relatively ineffective.\n\n\"Prigozhin and those guys, theyve been fighting for how many months?\" he said. \"But Bakhmut is still ours. On the other hand, its a shame because were exchanging the lives of our soldiers and officers very good officers for the lives of these Russian convicts.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials in Kyiv, from Zelensky down, have regularly emphasized that every piece of Ukrainian territory must be fought for, noting they are unwilling to abandon Ukrainian citizens to Russian occupation.\n\n\"For us, Bakhmut is the same corner of our country as Soledar, Kherson, Melitopol, Kharkiv or Dnipro. It is our native land. We fight and will fight for every meter of our land,\" said Yuriy Skala, the commander of an intelligence battalion currently fighting in Bakhmut. \"But we will fight smartly: If the circumstances require a tactical maneuver, the top military leadership will surely make the right conclusions and actions.\"\n\n\"I will support the commander in chiefs decision to maneuver tactically and create a new line of defense if it becomes clear that casualties are too high,\" Skala added. \"We are not Russians. We are Ukrainians, and human life is the highest value for us.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMason Clark, a senior analyst and Russia team lead at the Institute for the Study of War, said he would be surprised if Ukrainian military officials allowed their force in Bakhmut to suffer a level of attrition significant enough to impact their ability to launch a counteroffensive elsewhere, noting that commanders have demonstrated astute operational planning.\n\nThe Ukrainian military is cognizant of the need to preserve forces for a coming counteroffensive, the senior U.S. official said.\n\n\"They are still fighting, but they arent fighting with the same amount of resources that they originally were, because they likewise share concerns about sustainability here,\" the official said.\n\nThe Ukrainians are not \"giving up the ghost,\" the official said. \"They are marshaling their forces appropriately.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe senior U.S. official cautioned against completely dismissing Bakhmut or neighboring Soledar as nonstrategic places that Kyiv can simply relinquish, noting that the salt and gypsum mines give the area economic significance. Theoretically, the Russians could use the deep salt mines and tunnels to protect equipment and ammunition from Ukrainian missile strikes. Moscow has also endowed the city with import.\n\n\"To some degree, Bakhmut matters to [Ukraine] because it matters so much to the Russians,\" the senior U.S. official said, noting that control of Bakhmut is not going to have a huge impact on the conflict or imperil Ukraines defensive or offensive options in the countrys eastern Donbas region.\n\nThe official added, \"Bakhmut is not going to change the war.\"\n\nKhurshudyan reported from Kyiv.

But outsiders can hear the growls emanating from behind the Kremlins walls.\n\nThe only thing thats plain is that its still Mr. Putin who calls the shots, maintaining his authority by playing factions against each other so they see him as the sole arbiter of their disputes.\n\nThis is how the former KGB agent has ruled since coming to power at the turn of the century: Create a divide, then preside over the quarrel.\n\nWhen Mr. Putin first took office in 2000, it was liberal reformers and throwback statists who competed for his favour. Later, it was pro-Western doves and Cold War hawks who pitched their ideas to the boss. Now that those battles are over and Mr. Putins regime has moved to outright authoritarianism and aggression, the competing factions are the formal military command and the freelance operatives who believe Russia should resort to even more brutal tactics to achieve its aims.\n\nThe latest skirmish under the rug resulted in Valery Gerasimov, already the Chief of the General Staff, assuming direct authority over what the Kremlin still calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. General Sergey Surovikin, the top commander in Ukraine for the past three months, was demoted to become one of Gen. Gerasimovs three deputies for the campaign.\n\nThe move comes after months of intense criticism of Gen. Gerasimov and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu emanating from a group of hardliners headed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a long-time Putin confidant who shot to prominence through his control of the Wagner Group, a private military organization that has fought alongside the Kremlins friends in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nSergey Markov, a hawkish political analyst with Kremlin connections, told The Globe and Mail that the shuffle was influenced by the Wagner Groups rising influence. \"Its the Wagnerization of the Russian army. One of the reasons for the success of Wagner is its lack of military bureaucracy. All of the information from the ground goes to Prigozhin very quickly. Its a big difference from the Russian army.\"\n\nNow, Mr. Markov said, Gen. Gerasimov will receive updates directly, as Mr. Prigozhin does, and will \"be able to make commands stronger and faster.\"\n\nBut the practical effects of Wednesdays shuffle seem less important than the political implications.\n\nMr. Prigozhin and his allies, most notably Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, have mounted an increasingly open campaign to pin the blame for Russias military failures in Ukraine on Mr. Shoigu and Gen. Gerasimov. In late December, a video emerged in which Wagner mercenaries whose ranks include tens of thousands of former convicts released from prison to join the war used expletives to refer to Gen. Gerasimov, accusing the top general of leaving men on the front line without enough ammunition. \"We are fighting against the entire Ukrainian army near Bakhmut. Where are you? Its about time you help us,\" one masked fighter said.\n\nThe conflict escalated on Dec. 28 when Mr. Prigozhin backed his mercenaries in their criticism of the general. \"The guys asked me to pass along that when youre sitting in a warm office, its hard to hear the problems on the front line,\" Mr. Prigozhin said via his press service when asked to comment on the video. \"But when youre dragging the dead bodies of your friends every day, and seeing them for the last time, then supplies are very much needed. And you want everyone to stir and at least in some way to think about how it is for those on the front line.\"\n\nThis week, Mr. Prigozhin upped the ante when he claimed that Wagner, and Wagner alone, had captured the salt-mining town of Soledar, in the southeastern Donbas region, near the fiercely contested city of Bakhmut. While Ukrainian officials say the battle for Soledar is continuing, Mr. Prigozhin posed in full battle gear for a photograph with half a dozen of his men Wednesday inside what looked to be part of the towns sprawling complex of salt mines.\n\nAt the same time, he and Mr. Kadyrov whose Chechen fighters are, like Wagner, notorious for their indifference to the rules of war have praised Gen. Surovikin for stabilizing the front line in Ukraine. Gen. Surovikin took command of the war in October, in the wake of a Ukrainian counteroffensive that pushed Russian troops out of the eastern Kharkiv region. It was his decision to withdraw forces from the southern city of Kherson to more defensible positions on the east bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nBut Gen. Surovikin hasnt been able to reclaim the initiative in a war that has seen Ukraine, bolstered by a supply of advanced Western weaponry, push Russia out of 40 per cent of the territory it seized earlier in the war. Wagners victory in Soledar, if confirmed, would represent the first significant Russian territorial gain in months.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov attend an annual meeting of the Defence Ministry Board in Moscow, Dec. 21, 2022.SPUTNIK/Reuters\n\nMr. Putin may have sensed that Gen. Gerasimov was growing tired of Mr. Prigozhins antics. Some military analysts have predicted a new Russian offensive may soon follow, allowing Gen. Gerasimov to claim credit for any advances and perhaps pose with his own troops near the front line.\n\n\"The Kremlins intentions are obvious. A strategic offensive operation is being prepared,\" Valentyn Badrak, director of the Kyiv-based Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, wrote on the groups website. Mr. Badrak predicted that much of the fighting would be left to Wagner mercenaries until the spring, when the Russian army bolstered by fresh conscripts would mount a \"last\" major offensive.\n\nSome observers have suggested that Gen. Gerasimov has been handed a poisoned chalice. The Russian military after almost 11 months of fighting doesnt appear to have the capacity to achieve Mr. Putins aim of asserting control over the four Ukrainian provinces he claimed to annex last year, let alone achieve the original goal of capturing Kyiv.\n\nBut Mr. Putin is doubling down on his invasion. Mr. Markov said Russian society was coming to understand that the war in Ukraine would be a long one.\n\nAnd despite Western hopes that Mr. Putins grip on power would be shaken by now through economic sanctions and military setbacks, one thing Mr. Shoigu, Gen. Gerasimov, Mr. Prigozhin and Mr. Kadyrov have in common is their overt loyalty to Mr. Putin. That and his lingering power over all of them.",

The Guardian was not able to independently verify this report.\n\nRussia claimed that its strikes on Ukraine on New Years Eve including the launch of more than 20 cruise missiles that killed at least three people were targeting its neighbours drone production.

Ukrainian officials claim Russia is deliberately targeting civilians.\n\nUkraines most senior defence officials have said they believe Russia will attempt a second invasion from the north in the next couple of months , using troops who have been training for the past three months since being mobilised in October. But the Ukrainian forces defending the border say the Russians will not be able to break through as they did in February, when the Sumy region had no defensive lines.\n\nOver the last five days, Russian and Ukrainian forces have probably been fighting for control of the P66 highway north of the Russian-held Luhansk town of Kremina, the UK Ministry of Defence reports. The P66 is a \"key supply route for the northern section of Russias Donbas front from the Belgorod region of Russia\" and its use has been disrupted by Ukrainian artillery since October, the ministry adds.\n\nUkraine published the latest figures regarding Russian losses since the beginning of the invasion last February.

Air raid alerts were sounded in Kyiv and across eastern Ukraine , beginning just before midnight and still wailing hours later. Debris from a destroyed drone hit Kyivs northeastern Desnianskiy district, wounding a 19-year-old man who was later taken to hospital, the citys mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said .\n\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has praised Ukrainians for showing gratitude to the troops and one another and said Russias efforts would prove useless. \"Drones, missiles, everything else will not help them,\" he said of the Russians. \"Because we stand united.

Spokesperson for the Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces Serhiy Cherevaty reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian attacks on Bilohorivka (approximately 13km southeast of Kreminna), and the Luhansk Oblast Administration reported that Ukrainian forces eliminated a Russian armored group near Ploshchanka (approximately 13km northwest of Kreminna).[43] A Russian milblogger also claimed that Russian forces attempted an attack on Ploshchanka but did not specify an outcome.[44] Another Russian source claimed that Ukrainian forces are preparing a large-scale attack near Kreminna and noted that Russian forces are expecting a Ukrainian counteroffensive operation once the ground freezes in the area.[45] The source also added that Ukrainian forces are erecting pontoon crossings southwest of Kreminna and are reconnoitering Russian positions near Dibrova (approximately 6km west of Kreminna), Kreminna, and Bilohorivka. ISW makes no effort to assess the validity of these claims.\n\nunderstandingwar.org/...\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nUkrainian sources reported that Russian forces are redeploying along the eastern axis while struggling to maintain the pace of artillery strikes. Spokesperson for Ukraines Eastern Group of Forces Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty stated on January 2 that Russian forces have decreased their rate of shelling from 2080,000 rounds per day to a maximum of 20,000 per day and are searching for Soviet 122mm and 152mm caliber ammunition stores both domestically and internationally.[50] Cherevaty stated that Russian forces prioritize shelling the Bakhmut and Avdiivka frontline over other areas of the front. The Ukrainian Center for Defense Strategies stated on January 1 that two Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) of the 137th Guards Airborne Regiment of the 106th Guards Tula Airborne Division arrived near Popasna, Luhansk Oblast, and are expected to operate in the Popasna-Soledar or Popasna-Bakhmut directions.[51] These BTGs are likely degraded and demoralized.\n\nRussian forces continued to conduct ground attacks near Bakhmut and Avdiivka on January 1 and 2 at a low rate of advance. Wagner Group financier Yevgeniy Prigozhin stated that Ukrainian forces have heavily fortified the residential area around Bakhmut so there is a new line of defense \"every 10 meters.\"[52] The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 1 and 2 that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground attacks near Bakhmut; north of Bakhmut near Krasna Hora; northeast of Bakhmut near Soledar, Bilohorivka, Rozdolivka, and Bakhmutske; south of Bakhmut near Ozaryanivka; and southwest of Bakhmut near Klishchiivka.[53] A Russian source claimed that Russian forces captured a few Ukrainian positions near Klishchiivka, and geolocated footage shows that Russian forces have made marginal advances near the settlement.[54] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces advanced up to 1.7km in the Soledar-Bakhmutske area and captured Ukrainian positions northeast of Bakhmut near Pidhorodne, but ISW cannot confirm these claims.[55] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground attacks southwest of Avdiivka near Opytne and Krasnohorivka on January 2.[56] A Russian milblogger claimed that fighting is ongoing near Marinka and that Russian forces are attempting to advance from the Nevelske, Pervomaiske, and Opytne directions towards Kamianka.[57]\n\nunderstandingwar.org/...\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nRussian forces continued limited ground attacks across the southern axis between January 1 and 2.

Russian forces continued to shell settlements along the southern axis.[62]\n\nVarious sources continued to report that Russian forces are constructing defenses and rebuilding force capacities in Zaporizhia Oblast and Crimea. Sentinel satellite imagery shows trench constructions apparently completed by Russian soldiers as of December 29 along the P37 road near Bohdanivka in central Zaporizhia Oblast.[63] Ukraines Center for Defense Strategies reported on January 1 that Russian forces are deploying \"territorial troops\" (formed from mobilized men in light infantry units), endeavoring to restore combat capability to the 205th and 34th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigades of the 49th Army, and deploying a logistics hub and two logistics routes in Crimea and southern Zaporizhia Oblast.[64] Advisor to the Ukrainian Mayor of Mariupol Petro Andryushchenko similarly stated on January 2 that Russian authorities deployed freshly mobilized soldiers to Urzuf, Donetsk Oblast (4km from the border with Zaporizhia Oblast).[65] Satellite imagery shows that Russian forces expanded the Belbek Air Base in Crimea between June 30, 2022 and January 1, 2023.[66] [67]\n\nunderstandingwar.org/...\n\nCorruption became even worse following Russias chaotic invasion of Georgia in 2008. Putin began throwing money at the armed forces. The waste on prestige projects encouraged contractors and generals alike to pad their bank accounts. Little appears to have been done in reassessing military doctrine. The Russian idea of urban warfare had still not evolved from World War II, with their artillery, the \"god of war,\" smashing everything to rubble. This approach would continue during Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war from 2015.\n\nYet Putins greatest triumph in Russian eyes was the covert seizure of Crimea the year before by infiltrating it with un-uniformed \"little green men\" from special forces. This was part of Putins angry reaction to the Maidan revolution in Kyiv, which forced his ally President Viktor Yanukovych to flee and led to the start of fighting in the Donbas region of Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.\n\nwww.foreignaffairs.com/...\n\nx Ukrainian HIMARS continue to conduct strikes on large bases of Russian forces many kilometres behind the frontline.\n\nThese bases often have large amounts of soldiers and equipment stationed at them with little regard for camouflage or dispersing sleeping quarters WarMonitor (@WarMonitor3) January 2, 2023\n\nx Video of the consequences of a strike on temporarily occupied Makiivka - Reuters.\n\nRussian Ministry of Defense confirmed the strike of Ukrainian Army on the lodgings of Russian military in Makiivka.

They included soldiers from the 44th and 45th regiments. Some escaped after the first missile hit.\n\n3/ According to the relative of one of the survivors, \"Many more people [than the claimed 63] were killed. They are still being pulled out from under the rubble.\" She suspects that local people gave the location to the Ukrainians: \"They were breathing poison on them there.\"\n\n4/ Some soldiers managed to escape from the building's basement. As previously reported, many of the casualties will need to be identified from DNA records. One survivor says he and his colleagues have been \"cleaning brains off our boots\".\n\n5/ A wife says: \"Indeed, there are many dead. I know that almost everything they had was left in that place [in the school building]. I only know that many were torn apart to such an extent that there was practically nothing left of the bodies.\"\n\n6/ Survivors have been taken to hospital in Russia's Rostov region. The wife of one survivor says that her husband \"just texted a few words to me that he is alive and well. More guys called who survived, they're walking around naked in flip flops.\n\n7/ There is nothing [for them]: no things, no medicines, no money, no food ... It's just awful.\"\n\n8/ The lack of supplies for the survivors is highlighted by an appeal posted by relatives of mobilised men from Saratov who they say have lost everything in the attack: \"All company property has been destroyed, we are bare-assed.\n\n9/ \"People only have left what they were wearing, there is nothing more.\" A relative says: \"Everything that the mobilized had with them remains under the rubble. We need EVERYTHING!\" The relatives are now trying to crowd-source supplies to replace what was lost.\n\n10/ Although claims have been published that the Ukrainians managed to locate the Russian troop concentration in Makiivka from cellphone data, this is doubted by the well-connected VChK-OGPU Telegram channel. It reports:\n\n11/ \"Makiivka is a small town, next to Donetsk and accordingly, everyone can see who and what has arrived in the compound. Especially when it's a lot of fighters and equipment. Even there, not everyone is pro-Russian. And there are spotters and [artillery] correctors.\n\n12/ But in spite of it, they periodically place mobilized people there. Moreover, HIMARS has already flown into those regions.\n\nLast summer, the headquarters of a tank battalion in Horlivka was smashed to rubble by a similar flight [of missiles].\n\n13/ This fact was not publicised and not many people knew about it. The tankers had been meeting there in a five-storey building, which was some kind of administrative building, until February. In June, the mobiks from the DNR were moved in. The top two floors were full.\n\n14/ Then they were spontaneously removed somewhere and the next day rockets flew in. There was clearly a calculation to hit a cluster of fighters, the tankers hardly ever showed up at the headquarters. But, thanks to chance, the recruits survived.\n\nUkraine has confirmed it carried out a strike in the occupied region of Donetsk, which it earlier claimed killed 400 Russian troops. Russian officials contested the figure, saying only 63 troops were killed. Neither claim has been verified, and access to the site is restricted. The attack on New Year's Day hit a building in the city of Makiivka, where Russian forces were stationed. It is extremely rare for Moscow to confirm any battlefield casualties. But this was such a deadly attack, says the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg, that staying silent most probably wasn't an option. It is the highest number of deaths acknowledged by Moscow in a single incident since the war began ten months ago. In a statement on Monday, Russia's defence ministry said Ukrainian forces fired six rockets using the US-made Himars rocket system at a building housing Russian troops. Two of them were shot down, it added. A number of Russian commentators and bloggers acknowledged the attack - but said the numbers were lower than claimed by Ukraine. But Igor Girkin, a pro-Russian commentator, said hundreds had been killed and wounded, although the exact number was still unknown because of the large number still missing. www.bbc.com/... x If ever you thought that Russians had any semblance of conscience, then please think again. Russian soldiers can now claim stolen Ukraine plunder as \"charitable gifts\". Ethics mean nothing to a corrupt and murderous nation. https://t.co/02S2u0dmA5 via @nationalpost Dave (@algonquindave) January 2, 2023\n\n\"By attacking Ukraine, the breadbasket of the world, Putin is attacking the worlds poor, spiking global hunger when people are already on the brink of famine,\" said Samantha Power, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID.\n\nUkrainians are likening the events to the Holodomor, when Joseph Stalin engineered a famine in Soviet-ruled Ukraine 90 years ago that killed millions.\n\nMr. Blinken announced on Dec. 20 that the U.S. government would begin granting blanket exceptions to its economic sanctions programs worldwide to ensure that food aid and other assistance kept flowing. The action is intended to ensure that companies and organizations do not withhold assistance for fear of running afoul of U.S. sanctions.\n\nState Department officials said it was the most significant change to U.S. sanctions policy in years. The United Nations Security Council adopted a similar resolution on sanctions last month.\n\nBut Russias intentional disruption of global food supplies poses an entirely different problem.\n\nMoscow has restricted its own exports, increasing costs elsewhere. Most important, it has stopped sales of fertilizer, needed by the worlds farmers. Before the war, Russia was the biggest exporter of fertilizer.\n\nIts hostilities in Ukraine have also had a major impact. From March to November, Ukraine exported an average of 3.5 million metric tons of grains and oilseeds per month, a steep drop from the five million to seven million metric tons per month it exported before the war began in February, according to data from the countrys Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food.\n\nwww.nytimes.com/...\n\nx Chatted about this elsewhere but it hits on something that's clearly a hardship for Ukraine (and probably more so Russia). To be clear this is anecdotal observations not hard data- but Ukraine seems to lack enough paramedic medevac capacity. I broadly categorize combat medicine https://t.co/y1olZDJHWd Ukraine Memes for NATO Teens (@LivFaustDieJung) January 2, 2023\n\ninto 3 categories: 1) the combat medics with your platoon who can provide that stabilizing care for critical wounded to keep them alive until medevac or basic care for lesser wounds. These can be fighters with you who also have medical skills or dedicated medics. These are indispensable, no one survives to secondary care with serious wounds without this first level of care.\n\n2) ambulatory medics. These are dedicated medical crews whose sole function is to get casualties to the next level of care and treat what can be treated on the way (like a peacetime ambulance crew). This seems to be a gap for Ukraine. Both in the number of available (and appropriate) combat ambulances (armored or otherwise) & medical personnel to man them. Ukraine is having to scramble to get the wounded into whatever vehicle is available & hope there is an a available medic to ride with them (& to be clear this isn't universal. Some areas definitely have dedicated ambulance personnel - notably most Kraken footage includes scenes of their ambulance crews moving wounded to care). But it seems very uneven, with some areas well served, & others able to get a ride to the hospital but not medical care enroute.\n\nThat 3rd, & in the long run, most valuable/difficult to replace: the hospitallers, nurses, techs, & surgeons who help enable the \"Golden Hour\" to exist, who prevent minor wounds from becoming fatalities/crippled, & who enable casualties to heal & sometimes return to the fight. This segment is by necessity a mixture of Ukrainian military and civil medicine, takes the longest time to regenerate, & has to be safeguarded/hardened more than medical capacity on the FLOT.\n\nMy concern is that while Ukraine is doing an admirable job training up medics (& giving baseline first aid training to troops) & safeguarding it's more permanent medical services in the rear, that middle ground of fulltime ambulatory medics/suitable ambulances is the tier that is suffering. There is no real easy answer either. To divert vehicles to that purpose is to take them from other taskings. To divert medics to that purpose is to rob them from front line units.\n\nOne thing I think Ukraine *could* do, is repurpose the helicopters currently spamming unguided rockets in the general direction of Russian positions, into medevac platforms with permanent medical crews/ambulance setups. The FLOT is too dangerous to land helos, I fully get that, but if units can get their most seriously wounded even a kilometer or two behind the FLOT, a helo medevac crew (& Ukraine *does* do this- just not a lot) could drastically extend not only the reach of Ukrainian medicine but the ability to deliver the most serious casualties to hospital care further away, relieving strain on hospitals near the front.\n\nAll this is easy to say as a non-participant with unlimited imaginary dollars to suggest this. Ukraine is midwar, they don't have much time or money to experiment, and this is a task that is hard even for well funded western militaries.\n\nWhich is why I think the West should take the lead on helping establish this capacity. The UK is giving Ukraine surplus helicopters that would perfectly fit this need. The UK is also one of the militaries I would point to with an excellent medevac capacity & history. Outfitting these helos as flying ERs would give Ukraine, even in miniature, a capacity to save dozens of lives daily that might otherwise die prior to reaching a higher echelon of care.\n\nI'm an anonymous nobody on Twitter spamming thoughts, but anyway, that's my hopes for near term western aid to Ukraine- ambulatory aid. Had to delete and repost multiple times because Twitter is fucking useless right now, but this finally all went through. Would welcome the more medically minded, especially those closely watching Ukraine's combat medicine efforts, to comment.\n\nx The head of the Polish Volunteer Team of Battlefield Medics @DamianDuda17 evacuating a wounded defender of Ukraine from Soledar, one of the hottest spots at the front line.

Libkos/Associated Press\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday that its troops had captured the eastern salt-mining town of Soledar, a claim quickly rejected by Ukraines military, which said that its soldiers were hanging on.\n\nAfter a string of setbacks for Russia, capturing Soledar would represent the biggest success for Moscows forces in months, though military analysts have cautioned that the small town is of limited strategic value.\n\nThe battle has put into sharp relief Russias costly and grinding offensive in eastern Ukraine as it attempts to take the nearby city of Bakhmut, part of its goal of controlling the entire Donbas region.\n\nSeizing Soledar is not expected to quickly change the battle in the east, but it would give Moscows forces new locations to place artillery and the potential to partially encircle Bakhmut from the north. It could put pressure on Ukrainian supply lines that run toward the city.\n\nRussias Defense Ministry said in a statement on Friday that its troops had \"completed\" their capture of the town overnight.\n\nBut Volodymyr Zelensky, president of Ukraine, said late Friday that the battle for Soledar as well as other towns in the countrys east is ongoing.\n\n\"Although the enemy has concentrated its greatest forces in this direction, our soldiers the Armed Forces of Ukraine, all defense and security forces are protecting the state,\" Mr. Zelensky wrote on the social messaging app Telegram.\n\nRussian forces in the area far outnumber the Ukrainian forces who remain, according to people familiar with the matter on the Ukrainian side in the Donbas region. They said the fighting was fierce and that resupply efforts were hindered by heavy Russian tank fire.\n\nOver the past several days there have been conflicting reports about who controls Soledar, where hundreds of civilians are trapped in a town that has largely been reduced to rubble. This week, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, which is fighting for Russia in Ukraine, claimed that his fighters had seized control of the town. Ukraine denied the reports, and the Kremlin walked back the assertion at the time.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said in its statement on Friday that Soledar was \"of great importance for continuing successful offensive operations\" in the Donbas region.\n\nMilitary analysts say that the fall of Soledar were would not necessarily mean that Bakhmut or the whole of the Donbas is next.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said in an analysis on Thursday that geolocated footage indicated that Moscows forces \"likely control most if not all of Soledar\" but called the capture \"at best a Russian Pyrrhic tactical victory\" after Moscow had committed significant resources. It added that the battle will have contributed to \"Russian forces degraded combat power and cumulative exhaustion.\"\n\nThe White Houses national security spokesman, John Kirby, echoed those sentiments on Thursday when asked about the status of Soledar, cautioning that it was important to \"keep this in perspective.\"\n\n\"We dont know how its going to go, so Im not going to predict failure or success here,\" he told reporters. \"But even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, its not going to make a its not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself.\"\n\nHe added: \"If you look at whats been happening over the last 10 and a half months, particularly in the Donbas, towns and villages have swapped hands quite frequently.\"\n\nAbout 559 civilians including 15 children were trapped in Soledar as the brutal battle unfolded, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the local Ukrainian military administration, said on Ukrainian state television on Thursday.\n\nIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.",

REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nSummary Mercenary boss explains his rationale for fierce battle\n\nSays he wants control of vast underground complex\n\nSays tanks and troops can move about there\n\nLONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The founder of Russia's most high-profile mercenary group said on Saturday he wanted his forces and the regular Russian army to capture the small city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine because it possessed \"underground cities\" that can hold troops and tanks.\n\nRussia's grinding more than five months-long push to try to take Bakhmut has puzzled some Western military analysts who have said that heavy losses incurred on the Russian side and the fact that Ukraine has built defensive lines to fall back to nearby mean any Russian victory there, if it happens, would be pyrrhic.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russia's Wagner mercenary group which is fighting in the battle of Bakhmut, set out in detail on Saturday why he thought its capture would be significant.\n\n\"The cherry on the cake is the system of Soledar and Bakhmut mines, which is actually a network of underground cities. It not only (has the ability to hold) a big group of people at a depth of 80-100 metres, but tanks and infantry fighting vehicles can also move about.\"\n\nPrigozhin, who would likely see his political capital in Moscow boosted if Bakhmut fell to Russia given Wagner's role in the fighting there, said stockpiles of weapons had been stored in the underground complexes since World War One.\n\nHis comments were a reference to vast salt and other mines in the area which contain more than 100 miles of tunnels and a vast underground room which has hosted football matches and classical music concerts in more peaceful times.\n\nA White House official said on Thursday that Washington believed Prigozhin wanted to take control of salt and gypsum mines in the area for commercial reasons. It made no mention of their alleged subterranean military use.\n\nPrigozhin, who is sanctioned in the West, cited other advantages of taking Bakhmut, calling it \"a serious logistics centre\" with unique defensive fortifications.\n\nHe made his comments on his press service's Telegram channel as shellfire echoed around Bakhmut's near-deserted streets on Saturday despite a self-declared Russian ceasefire to mark Orthodox Christmas, something Kyiv rejected as a ploy.\n\nBakhmut, which Russia calls Artyomovsk, is the focus of the most intense fighting in Ukraine, and Prigozhin made his comments as another Telegram channel associated with Wagner claimed Russia had captured a strategically-important settlement on Bakhmut's outskirts.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the assertion.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry earlier on Saturday reported fierce fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\nA Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman said the town of Soledar, which is near Bakhmut and hosts a salt mine, was still under Ukrainian control despite what he described as fierce Russian assaults.\n\nReporting by Andrew Osborn Editing by Christina Fincher\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nRussian media reported on January 10 that Colonel General Aleksandr Lapin, former commander of the Central Military District (CMD) and Russian forces in eastern Kharkiv and northern Donetsk oblasts, has been appointed Chief of Staff of the Russian Ground Forces. Russian outlet URA, citing unidentified Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) sources, reported that Lapin took over from Colonel General Vasily Tonkoshkurov as Chief of Staff of the Russian Ground Forces on January 9.[1] It is unclear why Tonkoshkurov was removed from this position and what his next role will be. While official Kremlin and MoD sources have not confirmed the claim, it was widely circulated and responded to as fact among military commentators in the Russian information space.[2] Lapins appointment is notably to the position of Chief of Staff of the Russian Ground Forces (also known as the Russian Army), not the Russian Armed Forces as a whole. Army General Valery Gerasimov likely remains Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces. The Chief of Staff of the Russian Army is not a frontline command position, and while Lapins specific duties (in the currently fragmented Russian command structure) are unclear, he is unlikely to directly command troops in Ukraine.\n\nLapins previous role as commander of the \"Central\" group of Russian forces in Ukraine and commander of the Russian Central Military District (CMD) was checkered with controversy following the successful Ukrainian counteroffensive that retook large swaths of territory in eastern Kharkiv and northern Donetsk oblasts in September 2022. The Russian MoD confirmed Lapins appointment as commander of the \"Central\" grouping on June 24, 2022, and noted he was responsible for operations in the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area and likely the broader Luhansk-Donetsk Oblast border area.[3] Lapin went on to receive a \"Hero of Russia\" medal on July 4 for his role in the Russian capture of Lysychansk.[4] Lapin was also the commander responsible for Lyman, Donetsk Oblast, and received strong criticism from prominent voices in the Russian information space for his claimed responsibility for massive Russian losses following successful Ukrainian counteroffensives in mid-September of 2022 that pushed Russian forces to the Kharkiv-Luhansk Oblast border.[5] Following the disastrous Russian loss of most of Kharkiv Oblast and the critical settlement of Lyman, the Kremlin reportedly removed Lapin from both command of the \"Central\" grouping and CMD.[6] The pro-war information spaces response to Lapins perceived command failures served as a catalyst for a fracture between a faction led by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhinthe silovikiand the Russian MoD establishment that milbloggers widely claimed Lapin represented.[7] Kadyrovs staunch and pointed criticism of Lapin at the time demonstrated that the siloviki faction saw itself as fundamentally at odds with the conventional Russian MoD and associated elements.[8]\n\nLapins appointment as army Chief of Staff may be intended to serve as a counterbalance to the growing prominence of the siloviki. Prigozhin and Kadyrov both have largely private armed forces at their disposal (Kadyrovs Chechen fighters and Prigozhins Wagner Group) and are capitalizing on the gains made by these forces to promote themselves politically, as ISW has frequently reported.[9] As the anti-Russian MoD voices gain more relevance and support throughout the Russian pro-war information space, which perceives this faction as generally more competent, motivated, and effective than the Russian MoD, Russian military leadership may seek to rehabilitate and bolster Lapins reputation to establish the Russian MoD as a competent and structured wartime apparatus and balance out the growing influence of the Kadyrov-Prigozhin faction. Additionally, considering that the Chief of Staff of the Russian Army is more of a logistical and organizational oversight role than a command position, the Russian MoD may be using Lapins appointment to posture a commitment to the sound structuring of Russian ground forces in response to continued criticisms of the efficacy of the Russian army. While the Kremlin has at times distanced itself and even blamed the Russian MoD for military failures in Ukraine, the Kremlin likely maintains a vested interest in bolstering public perceptions of the MoDs efficacy. The Russian military apparatus writ large likely benefits from the public perception that it is an appropriately managed wartime instrument. ISW has previously reported on the Kremlins attempts to rehabilitate the reputation of the Russian MoD and affiliated elements, including prior efforts to rehabilitate Lapins reputation.[10]\n\nLapins appointment may alternatively suggest that the Russian MoD increasingly must fill important leadership positions with previously disgracedor at minimum heavily publicly criticizedgeneral officers. Former Russian Eastern Military District (EMD) commander Colonel-General Alexander Chaiko, who led failed Russian efforts to take Kyiv in the early stages of the war, went on to serve as commander of Russian Armed Forces in Syria after he was replaced following the Kharkiv counteroffensive.[11] Colonel General Andrei Serdyukov, former commander of the Russian airborne forces (VDV) who was reportedly dismissed due to the poor performance of Russian paratroopers, now appears to have replaced Chaiko as commander of the Russian grouping in Syria.[12] The Russian MoD appears to be using previously disgraced and unpopular general officers to fill other, non-frontline command roles, suggesting that there is a systemic lack of general officers more suited to these positions.\n\nThe news of Lapins appointment generated further schisms in the already-fragmented pro-war Russian information space. Former militant commander and prominent milblogger Igor Girkin stated that Lapins new role must be a \"misunderstanding\" because Russian forces under Lapins command suffered major losses in Kharkiv Oblast.[13] Girkin concluded that Lapin represents a \"boorish\" attempt by the MoD to demonstrate their invulnerability.[14] A Wagner Group-affiliated Telegram group claimed that Lapin was also responsible for the disastrous May 5, 2022, Bilohorivka river crossing and additionally blamed Lapin for the loss of Lyman.[15] Other milbloggers responded more neutrally or even positively, with one suggesting that it was not Lapin but Lieutenant General Roman Berdnikov who was responsible for the loss of Lyman.[16] A pro-Kremlin milblogger credited Lapin with stabilizing the front after the collapse of Russian operations in Kharkiv Oblast.[17] The lack of consensus on who commanded the Lyman front among the Russian milblogger community further indicates the convoluted state of the Russian chain of command. Lapins new role will likely further the divide between the siloviki and affiliated milbloggers and milbloggers who have historically been more favorable to the Kremlin and the Russian MoD. This decision will likely open to Russian MoD to more criticism of its intentions and capabilities instead of addressing these concerns.\n\nRussian forces have not captured the entirety of Soledar despite several false Russian claims that the city has fallen and that Bakhmut risks imminent encirclement. Several Russian sources claimed that Wagner Group forces advanced into the west of Soledar on January 10.[18] Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin refuted these claims, remarking that Wagner Group forces are still fighting against concerted Ukrainian resistance.[19] ISW has only observed visual confirmation of Wagner Group forces in central Soledar as of January 10.[20] The reality of block-by-block control of terrain in Soledar is obfuscated by the dynamic nature of urban combat, however, and Russian forces have largely struggled to make significant tactical gains in the Soledar area for months. Even taking the most generous Russian claims at face value, the capture of Soledar would not portend an immediate encirclement of Bakhmut. Control of Soledar will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) into Bakhmut, as ISW has previously assessed.[21]\n\nIgor Girkin, former commander of Russian militants in Donbas and a prominent milblogger, heavily implied that he would support the removal of Russian President Vladimir Putin from office, his most direct criticism of Putin to date. Girkin criticized Putin for appointing and refusing to remove Russian military leaders who oversee frequent and disastrous military failures, in reference to Lapins appointment.[22] Russian milbloggers have historically criticized Russian military leaders and MoD officials while upholding Putin as an effective wartime leader, as ISW has previously reported.[23] Girkin extended his criticisms to non-military Putin appointees and advisors whose decisions negatively impacted Russias war performance and effort, noting that the common factor between these leaders is Putins decision to appoint them.[24] Girkin caveated his criticisms with an implied loyalty to the Russian state, softening his call for Putin to leave office by stating he is against a change of presidential leadership during the war, as it would lead to military and civil \"catastrophe.\"[25] Girkins criticisms, which he said he hopes will spark change even if they have \"suicidal\" consequences, indicate that growing frustration with the state of the war may be reaching a boiling point after nearly a year of hostilities among some milbloggers, prompting some milbloggers to reduce their self-censorship.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nRussian media reported on January 10 that Colonel General Aleksandr Lapin, former commander of the Central Military District and Russian forces in Kharkiv and northern Donetsk oblasts during Russia's significant losses in September 2022, has been appointed Chief of Staff of the Russian Ground Forces.\n\nThe news of Lapins appointment is generating further schisms in the already-fragmented pro-war Russian information space.\n\nIgor Girkin heavily implied that he would support the removal of Russian President Vladimir Putin from office, suggesting that a willingness to reduce self-censorship and directly criticize Putin may be growing among some milbloggers.\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff deviated from its normal reporting pattern about Russian forces in Belarus and near Ukraines northern border on January 10, an indicator of possible Russian preparations for an offensive in northern Ukraine, though ISW assesses this course of action remains unlikely at this time.\n\nUkrainian forces continued to make gains along the Svatove-Kreminna line.\n\nRussian forces conducted ground attacks across the Donetsk Oblast frontline and made gains around Soledar but have not captured the settlement, despite false claims.\n\nThe Kremlin continues to deny that Russian authorities are preparing for another wave of partial mobilization.\n\nRussian occupation authorities are struggling to contain an effective partisan movement in occupied territories.\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian CounteroffensivesEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and one supporting effort);\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortCapture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting EffortSouthern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast)\n\nUkrainian forces continued to make gains along the Svatove-Kreminna line on January 10. The Ukrainian Center for Defense Strategies confirmed that Ukrainian troops captured Pidkuichansk, 8km northwest of Svatove, on January 8.[26] Luhansk Oblast Head Serhiy Haidai stated that Russian forces are conducting limited counterattacks near Svatove to regain lost positions in the area.[27] A Russian milblogger reported that Russian troops attacked near Stelmakhivka, 13km northwest of Svatove.[28] Geolocated footage shows a Russian tank from the 3rd Motorized Rifle Division of the 20th Combined Arms Army of the Western Military District firing on Ukrainian positions west of Ploshchanka and approximately 17km northwest of Kreminna, indicating that Ukrainian troops have advanced closer to R66 Svatove-Kreminna highway.[29] A Russian milblogger also remarked that Russian troops attacked Ukrainian positions in the Ploshchanka area, further confirming that Russian troops have lost ground near Kreminna.[30] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks near Chervonopopivka (6km north of Kreminna) and Bilohorivka (10km south of Kreminna).[31]\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nWagner Group forces made further gains in Soledar on January 10. Spokesperson for the Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces Serhiy Cherevaty reported that the Wagner Group has concentrated its most capable (likely special operations) forces in Soledar as of January 10.[32] The Wagner Group likely hopes to build on recent marginal tactical gains by committing more elite assets to the area. Geolocated footage posted on January 9 shows Wagner Group forces fighting in central Soledar.[33] A Wagner Group-affiliated Telegram group posted additional footage on January 10 of Wagner Group forces near the city administration building in central Soledar and claimed that the Wagner Group is working to consolidate positions in the area.[34] Certain Russian milbloggers claimed that Wagner Group forces have moved into the western parts of Soledar and that Ukrainian troops have begun withdrawing from the settlement en masse.[35] Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin denied these claims and stated that Ukrainian troops are still fighting fiercely for Soledar.[36] Russian milbloggers also claimed that the Wagner Group is clearing Pidhorodne (just southwest of Soledar) and are moving on Krasna Hora and Paraskoviivka.[37] The Ukrainian General Staff reported continued fighting in other settlements near Soledar, including Bilohorivka and Pidhorodne.[38]\n\nRussian forces continued ground attacks in and around Bakhmut on January 10. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled attacks on Bakhmut itself and south of Bakhmut near Klishchiivka (7km southwest), Kurdiumivka (12km southwest), and Mayorsk (20km south).[39] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian troops are fighting for control of Klishchiivka in order to push north and cut the T0504 Chasiv Yar-Bakhmut highway.[40] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian troops have advanced to the northern borders of Opytne (3km south of Bakhmut) and are now on the southern outskirts of Bakhmut.[41] Russian sources additionally continued to discuss fierce fighting in the industrial zone on the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut.[42]\n\nRussian forces continued ground attacks along the western outskirts of Donetsk City on January 10. The Ukrainian General Staff stated that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian attacks near Vodiane (on the northwestern outskirts) and Marinka and Pobieda (on the southwestern outskirts).[43] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian troops attacked from near Novomykhailivka (just south of Donetsk City) toward Pobieda, about 4km directly south of Marinka.[44] The Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) Peoples Militia posted footage of the 5th DNR Brigade reportedly striking Ukrainian positions in Marinka.[45] Russian forces did not conduct any claimed or confirmed ground attacks in western Donetsk or eastern Zaporizhia oblasts and continued routine fire along the entire Avdiivka-Donetsk City and western Donetsk-eastern Zaporizhia oblast frontline.[46]\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nRussian and Ukrainian forces continued routine strikes across the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast on January 10. A Ukrainian source claimed that Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian Ka-52 attack helicopter near Kherson City.[47] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces struck a 200-person concentration of Ukrainian security personnel in Kherson City and inflicted high casualties.[48] ISW has not observed visual observation of this claim. ISW previously reported on January 8 that Russian military leadership is attempting to present similar claimed strikes on Ukrainian concentrations areas as \"retaliation\" for the December 31 Ukrainian strike on Russian positions in Makiivka, Donetsk Oblast, which reportedly killed up to 400 mobilized servicemen.[49] Russian forces shelled various areas of west (right) bank Kherson Oblast, including the Kherson City area and areas 33km west of Kherson City near Stanislav and Shyroka Balka.[50] Russian and Ukrainian sources reported that Ukrainian forces struck Tavriisk, Nova Kakhovka, and Skadovsk Raion, Kherson Oblast.[51]\n\nUkrainian officials reported that Russian forces continued to focus on holding occupied lines in the Zaporizhia direction on January 10.[52] Ukrainian Zaporizhia Oblast Head Oleksandr Starukh stated on January 9 that severe winter weather increases the likelihood of intense Russian combat reconnaissance along the Zaporizhia Oblast front line.[53] Russian forces continued routine fire in Zaporizhia, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts on January 10.[54] Ukrainian Mykolaiv Oblast Head Vitaly Kim stated on January 10 that Russian forces struck Ochakiv, Mykolaiv Oblast six times within 24 hours, and Spokesperson for Ukraine's Southern Operational Command, Natalya Humenyuk, stated that Russian forces targeted Ochakiv in retaliation for Ukrainian military successes.[55]\n\nUkrainian officials reported that Russian forces continue to militarize the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP). Ukrainian Atomic Energy Regulatory Commission Head Oleh Korkiv stated on January 10 that the Russian military established a military equipment and repair base at the ZNPP amid ongoing negotiations on the demilitarization of the ZNPP.[56] Korkiv also stated that Russian authorities have tried and failed multiple times to connect the ZNPP to the Russian power grid, and stated he is confident that further attempts will be unsuccessful.[57] The Head of the Ukrainian Joint Press Center of the Tavrisk Direction Defense Forces, Yevhen Yerin, stated on January 8 that Russian forces continue to store military personnel and equipment at the ZNPP.[58]\n\nRussian occupation authorities continued efforts to restore the Kerch Strait Bridge. Russian occupation authorities announced on January 10 that Russian authorities laid the first new span of the west (left) road bridge.[59] Occupation authorities claim that they plan to complete repairs to the road bridge by March 2023.[60] Russian forces have likely struggled to compensate for their diminished logistics capacity following the Kerch Strait Bridge attack, as ISW has previously reported.[61]\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nThe Kremin continues to deny that Russian authorities are preparing for another wave of \"partial mobilization.\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied reports of a new wave of partial mobilization on January 9 and called on Russian citizens to ignore Telegram channels that speculate about new mobilization efforts.[62] As ISW continues to assess, discussion of a second wave of mobilization is erroneous to some extent because mobilization has never truly ceased and the Kremlin has conducted a greater, ongoing effort to recruit reservists and others into service since before February 2022.[63]\n\nRussian occupation authorities continue mobilizing Ukrainian citizens in occupied Ukraine. The Luhansk Peoples Republic (LNR) Peoples Militia posted a video on January 10 of LNR recruiters working with Luhansk Oblast residents who \"volunteered\" to fight in the Russian military.[64] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian authorities mobilized 30 people - including four people with disabilities - during a raid in Horlivka, Donetsk Oblast, on January 6, and sent these people to service with a military unit after only two days of training.[65]\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nRussian occupation authorities are struggling to contain an effective partisan movement in occupied territories that is likely improving the targeting intelligence of Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian Resistance Center claimed on January 10 that Ukrainian partisans were responsible for a January 8 explosion at a Russian ammunition depot near the Hidromash factory in Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast.[66] Partisans may have sabotaged the depot or provided intelligence on the location of the ammunition depot to enable Ukrainian strikes.\n\nRussian occupation authorities continue to search for pro-Ukrainian civilians and partisans in occupied parts of Zaporizhia Oblast. Ukrainian Mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, reported on January 10 that occupation authorities are conflating pro-Ukraine sentiments with partisan activity and are advertising social media forums for residents to report Ukrainian partisans or anyone with a pro-Ukrainian viewpoint to occupation authorities.[67] Fedorov reported that occupation officials are encouraging residents to anonymously report their neighbors in exchange for money and are intimidating Ukrainian civilians through \"preventative talks\" and torture. Fedorov reported that occupation officials who capture pro-Ukraine civilians deport them \"outside of the occupied territories,\" likely to Russia. A senior official within the Zaporizhia Occupation Administration, Vladimir Rogov, announced on January 10 that Russian forces will search garages in Tokmak on January 13 for unspecified \"dangerous contents.\"[68] Occupation authorities may intend such preemptive announcements to draw out Ukrainian partisans for arrest if Russian intelligence did identify a partisan storage site, but may instead be setting conditions for simple theft via seizures of allegedly suspicious vehicles. Russian occupation authorities have repeatedly stolen cars, appliances, and other valuables belonging to Ukrainian civilians in occupied areas to export and resell them within Russia for personal gain.[69]\n\nISW will continue to report daily observed indicators consistent with the current assessed most dangerous course of action (MDCOA): a renewed invasion of northern Ukraine possibly aimed at Kyiv.\n\nISWs December 15 MDCOA warning forecast about a potential Russian offensive against northern Ukraine in winter 2023 remains a worst-case scenario within the forecast cone. ISW currently assesses the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine from Belarus as low, but possible, and the risk of Belarusian direct involvement as very low. This new section in the daily update is not in itself a forecast or assessment. It lays out the daily observed indicators we are using to refine our assessments and forecasts, which we expect to update regularly. Our assessment that the MDCOA remains unlikely has not changed. We will update this header if the assessment changes.\n\nObserved indicators for the MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff deviated from its normal reporting pattern about Russian forces in Belarus and near Ukraines northern border on January 10 by excluding its usual statement that Ukraine has not observed Russian forces forming strike groups in Belarus or northern Ukraine.[70] This is the first time the Ukrainian General Staff has excluded this statement since it reintroduced discussing Russian forces in Belarus on November 20.[71] This could indicate that the Ukrainian military has observed Russian forces forming strike groups in northern Ukraine. Alternatively, the situation may not have changed, and the Ukrainian General Staff may have left it out of the daily report in an isolated incident. ISW will continue to monitor and assess the language of Ukrainian General Staff reports.\n\nObserved ambiguous indicators for MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nReuters reported that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is \"gathering forces for another escalation\" but did not specify where, when, or how the unspecified escalation could occur.[72]\n\nRussian forces continue to deploy Russian elements to Belarus. Social media footage posted on January 10 reportedly shows likely Russian military equipment, including tube artillery with winter camouflage, on a train in Belarus moving west.[73] As ISW previously noted, applying winter camouflage to equipment is not wholly necessary for training activity and could indicate preparation for actual winter combat operations.[74]\n\nObserved counter-indicators for the MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nNothing significant to report.\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

State Border Guard Service Of Ukraine/via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nJan 11 (Reuters) - Russia said on Wednesday that it was making progress in military operations around the small salt mining town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine and had positive momentum, but acknowledged suffering heavy casualties.\n\nAsked about the situation on the ground, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"Let's not rush, let's wait for official statements. There is a positive dynamic in progress.\"\n\nUkraine said earlier its forces were holding out. The Ukrainian military's morning summary made one mention of Soledar, listing it as one of several towns being shelled in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region.\n\nReuters was unable to verify conditions on the ground.\n\nSoledar lies around seven km (four miles) northeast of Bakhmut, which Russia has been attempting to capture for months in fierce fighting led by the Wagner mercenary group.\n\nPeskov acknowledged the high cost of the operation in terms of soldiers' lives.\n\n\"Although tactical successes are also very important, they come at a high price, at the cost of the fantastic heroism of our fighters, and therefore this is another reason to be proud of our guys on the spot who spare neither life nor health to give us these tactical successes,\" he said.\n\nPeskov reiterated previous Kremlin statements that President Vladimir Putin remained open to talks on the war in Ukraine, now approaching the end of its 11th month, and that Russia would prefer to achieve its goals by political and diplomatic means.\n\nBut he said there was no prospect of talks, given the positions of Ukraine and the West.\n\nUkraine and its ally the United States say Putin has shown no sign he is serious about talks, suspecting a ploy by Russia to gain time to regroup after suffering a series of defeats in recent months.\n\nReporting by Reuters; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The drop in shelling is further evidence of Russias increasingly weak position on the battlefield nearly a year into its invasion, officials have told CNN. The officials did not give a clear or single explanation behind the striking decline in artillery fire. It is possible Russia may be rationing artillery rounds due to low supplies, or it could be part of a broader reassessment of tactics in the face of successful Ukrainian offences. Earlier this month, Russia suffered its worst military losses since the war in Ukraine began, when a deadly Ukrainian missile strike hit Makiivka, a small city in Ukraines eastern Donetsk region. Russias defence ministry said 63 soldiers had been killed in the strike. The Makiivka strike destroyed Russian supplies and raised questions among Russian military bloggers about the basic competence of top military officials. Referring to the Russians dwindling stockpiles, one US defence official said: Maybe this one strike is a drop in the bucket, but the bucket is getting smaller. It comes as Ukraine is enjoying increased military support from its western allies, as the UK mulls sending battle tanks for the first time and Germany and the US announcing it would provide Ukrainian troops with armoured fighting vehicles. US officials also believe the 36-hour ceasefire announced by Vladimir Putin last week to mark Orthodox Christmas was an attempt to pander to Russias extensive Christian population, the news channel reports.\n\nUpdated at 12.54 EST\n\n10 Jan 2023 12.09 EST German foreign minister pledges more weapons to Ukraine during surprise trip to Kharkiv Germanys foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, made a surprise trip to the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv today and confirmed that Berlin had promised to send more weapons to Kyiv, the German foreign ministry said. Baerbock met with her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, who said he had \"no doubts further German military aid will come\" after Berlin announced it would supply Kyiv with Marder infantry fighting vehicles and an additional Patriot air defence battery. Today, @ABaerbock and I visited wartime Kharkiv where Russia caused enormous suffering. Kharkiv is now a symbol of successful Ukrainian counteroffensives which prove Ukraine will win with sufficient support of partners. I have no doubts further German military aid will come. pic.twitter.com/iCErESAW2J Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) January 10, 2023 Ukrainians \"should know that they can rely on our solidarity and support,\" Baerbock said in a statement on her ministrys website. She also said it was important not to lose sight of Ukraines place in Europe and its desire to join the EU, as Ukrainians \"see their future in Europe, in the EU\". That is why I would also like to talk about the progress made in the accession process. As the Federal Government, we want to make very concrete offers to Ukraine in order to make progress in strengthening the rule of law, independent institutions and the fight against corruption, as well as in aligning with EU standards.\n\n10 Jan 2023 11.51 EST Nadia Khomami An online auction of Banksy prints for Ukraine was targeted by thousands of \"hostile attacks\" from within Russia, a charity has revealed.

The international charity, based in the UK, provides support to civilians affected by conflict. The set of 50 limited-edition screenprints were auctioned to raise money for Ukraine. Photograph: Legacy of War Foundation Fans had to register online for the prints, which depict a mouse sliding down the side of a box with \"FRAGILE\" printed on it, and cost 5,000 each.

Russia had announced earlier this month that Armenia would host the annual exercises of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a Russian-led alliance of post-Soviet countries which comprises Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. But Armenias prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, was cited by Interfax news agency as saying: The Armenian defence minister has informed the CSTO Joint Staff that in the current situation, we consider it unreasonable to hold CSTO exercises on the territory of Armenia. At least, such exercises will not take place in Armenia this year. Pashinyans move followed his refusal to sign a summit declaration from a meeting of the leaders of CSTO member nations in his countrys capital in November. During a \"family\" photograph of CSTO leaders, Pashinyan stepped away from Putin, later railing against the recent failures of the CSTO. Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan (L) in Yerevan, Armenia. Photograph: Getty Images He expressed frustration at the lack of a response to his formal request for the CSTO to intervene on Armenias behalf after his country came under fresh attack from across the border with Azerbaijan in September. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in an on-and-off conflict for three decades over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but largely controlled by the majority ethnic Armenian population. Asked about Pashinyans announcement, the Kremlins spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would ask Yerevan to clarify its position.\n\nUpdated at 11.43 EST\n\n10 Jan 2023 11.24 EST Western officials have warned that Ukraine will not be able to take back a significant amount of territory from Russia without an increase in military capability, including tanks and armoured vehicles. Western countries have already announced a step-up in their military aid to Ukraine this year. Last week, the US and Germany said they would provide 50 Bradley and 40 Marder fighting vehicles respectively. That followed an announcement by France that it would provide a number estimated at about 30 of light AMX-10 RC armoured vehicles in what appeared to be a coordinated sequence of announcements. Kyiv is hoping for a further breakthrough at or in the run-up to the next meeting of the \"Ramstein\" contact group of western defence ministers, which is scheduled for 20 January. Chaired by the US, the group coordinates military aid to Ukraine. Britain is currently considering supplying a handful of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, with a Downing Street spokesperson saying today that a final decision has yet to be made. Russian and Ukrainian forces are currently too closely matched for the Ukrainians to be able to mount a major offensive, a western official said today. They said a reported Ukrainian call for 300 tanks was \"not an unreasonable number\" to create the force mass needed for them to go on the attack. An initial report from Sky News suggested the UK was considering supplying about 10 Challenger 2s. The official said: The Ukrainians wont be unable to win back significant amounts of territory without changes to their force posture from last year. The force ratios between the Russians and the Ukrainians are too finely balanced. The UK, with a total fleet of 227 Challenger 2 tanks, has a small supply compared with what is made by Germany and the US. There are about 2,000 Leopard 2s in service in Europe with 13 different countries, but because they were originally made in Germany, the approval of Berlin would be required if any are to be re-exported to Ukraine. The official added: Something needs to break that deadlock, especially if they (the Ukrainians) are to win territory back and go on the offensive. Main battle tanks and APCs (armoured personnel carriers) are part of that mix. I think the Ukrainians would look to all partners who might provide tanks wont be particularly worried about where they come from just so long as they come in sufficient volume.\n\n10 Jan 2023 10.57 EST The Russian TV channel Dozhd, also known as TV Rain, has been granted a five-year broadcasting licence in the Netherlands after its licence had been cancelled in Latvia, the Dutch media authority announced. The permit will \"provide a commercial television broadcasting service as a commercial media institution\", the regulator said. One of the few independent TV channels in Russia, TV Rain shifted to broadcasting from Latvia and other countries in July when it was forced to shut its Moscow studio after Russias invasion of Ukraine. Latvia cancelled TV Rains licence in early December after the company was branded a threat to national security. In a statement, the channel said: TV Rain will move its editorial centre to Amsterdam. The Amsterdam studio will become the channels main studio. It said it had appealed the Latvian media watchdogs \"unjust\" decision.\n\nUpdated at 11.03 EST\n\n10 Jan 2023 10.31 EST Swedens domestic security agency (Sapo) has warned it expects Russia to increase activities threatening the countrys telecoms and power network. Russias actions were \"unpredictable\" but \"we can expect that Russian security-threatening activities against Sweden will increase\", Associated Press cited the Sapo head, Charlotte von Essen, as saying at a security conference in Salen, central Sweden. She said the sectors \"where there is reason to be particularly vigilant to counter espionage and sabotage\" are telecommunications, electricity supply and the transport of \"critical material\". Von Essen said: From the Russian side, there is an interest in disturbing these areas. These are sectors where attacks against Sweden could cause damage to the rest of Europe as well. Her agency expects Russia to make use, \"to a greater extent than before, of non-official platforms such as the Russian diaspora, institutions and companies in Sweden\", she said. She also warned of an increased spread \"of conspiracy theories and anti-state messages, which in the long run risks undermining trust in societys institutions, politicians decision-making and the states legitimacy\". She added: Both the threat of assassination and the threat to our constitution can arise in broad extremism. This is a development that plays into the hands of foreign power.\n\nUpdated at 10.37 EST",

Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters\n\nThe founder of a Russian mercenary force leading Moscows assault on the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine claimed late Tuesday that his troops had seized control of the town, which Ukrainian defense officials denied.\n\nThe claim that Soledar had fallen to soldiers-for-hire working for Wagner Group could not be verified, and Ukraines defense ministry said on Twitter just before midnight local time that Russia was still trying to capture the town. At close to 1 a.m. on Wednesday, Robert Magyar, a commander of a Ukrainian air reconnaissance group, said in a statement on Telegram that Ukrainian forces were still holding the town.\n\n\"True its hell\" he wrote, adding the claims were \"psychological pressure and propaganda.\"\n\nThe assault is part of Russias broader push in the area around the city of Bakhmut that Moscow sees as important to achieving its goal of occupying all of Ukraines eastern Donbas region. If true, the fall of Soledar, a relatively small municipality, would be Russias first significant victory in months, after a string of humiliating losses. Ukraine changed the course of the war with its capture of the Kharkiv region in September and then the city of Kherson in November, successes of far greater magnitude.\n\nMilitary experts say that although taking Soledar is significant, it does not signal that the city of Bakhmut is about to fall into Russian hands. Ukraine has strongly reinforced its positions in and around Bakhmut, presenting a formidable obstacle to further progress by Moscow.\n\nThe entrepreneur who started the Wagner Group, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, maintained in a post on the Telegram messaging app that his troops had control of all of Soledar, though he added that fighting continued.\n\n\"A cauldron has been formed in the center of the city, in which urban battles are being fought,\" Mr. Prigozhin said.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, said claims that Russia had taken all of Soledar were false, citing another comment from Mr. Prigozhin earlier Tuesday on Telegram: \"The Ukrainian army bravely fights for Bakhmut and Soledar. On the western outskirts of Soledar there are heavy bloody battles.\"\n\nIn his nightly address on Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine thanked the troops defending Soledar. \"Today, I would like to pay special tribute to the warriors of the 46th separate airmobile brigade for their bravery and steadfastness in the defense of Soledar!\" he said.\n\nHow a tiny, salt-mining town with a prewar population of 10,000 people became a focus of such a sustained assault by Wagners forces has been an open question. In his overnight address on Monday, Mr. Zelensky asked, \"What did Russia want to gain there?\"\n\nThe most critical factor is perhaps what Mr. Prigozhin and his mercenaries fighting there have to gain in terms of reputation. In Bakhmut, the Wagner Group, a private military contracting company that has recruited prisoners into its ranks, has become the main force leading the offensive for Russia, and the fighting has become bloodier.\n\nBefore the emergence of the Wagner Groups claims on Tuesday, Britains defense ministry said in its daily intelligence update that Russian forces and the Wagner Group were likely now in control of most of Soledar after intense fighting over the past four days. The capture of the city, which is about six miles north of the city of Bakhmut, was likely to be part of \"an effort to envelop Bakhmut from the north, and to disrupt Ukrainian lines of communication,\" the update said.\n\nA spokesman for the eastern group of Ukraines army, Serhiy Cherevatyi, said on national television on Tuesday that Russian artillery had struck Soledar 86 times over the past day. He described the situation as \"very challenging.\"\n\nThe tactics employed by the Wagner Group have resulted in a high number of casualties. In recent days, reporters for The New York Times embedded with a Ukrainian drone crew on the front line saw the bodies of Russian fighters scattered across open ground in the area around Bakhmut. Images and videos on Ukrainian social media in recent days also appear to have come from these aerial reconnaissance missions and show similar scenes.",

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putins announcement that Russian forces will conduct a 36-hour ceasefire between January 6 and January 7 in observance of Russian Orthodox Christmas is likely an information operation intended to damage Ukraines reputation. Putin instructed Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to initiate a ceasefire from 1200 January 6 to 2400 January 7 along the \"entire line of contact between parties in Ukraine\" and called on Ukraine to accept the ceasefire to allow \"a large number of citizens of citizens professing Orthodoxy\" to attend services on the day of Russian Orthodox Christmas.[1] Putins announcement was ostensibly in response to an appeal by Patriarch Kirill of Moscow (head of the Kremlin-controlled Russian Orthodox Church) for a temporary ceasefire in observance of Christmas Eve and the Day of the Nativity of Christ.[2] Ukrainian and Western officials, including US President Joe Biden, immediately highlighted the hypocrisy of the ceasefire announcement and emphasized that Russian forces continued striking Ukrainian military and civilian infrastructure on December 25when many Orthodox Ukrainians celebrate Christmasand New Years.[3]\n\nPutin could have been seeking to secure a 36-hour pause for Russian troops to afford them the ability to rest, recoup, and reorient to relaunch offensive operations in critical sectors of the front. Such a pause would disproportionately benefit Russian troops and begin to deprive Ukraine of the initiative. Putin cannot reasonably expect Ukraine to meet the terms of this suddenly declared ceasefire and may have called for the ceasefire to frame Ukraine as unaccommodating and unwilling to take the necessary steps towards negotiations. This is an intentional information tactic that Russia has previously employed, as ISW has reported.[4] Ceasefires also take time to organize and implement. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov notably said on December 14 that Russia has no plans for a ceasefire for Russian Orthodox Christmas, so Putins sudden January 5 announcement was surprising.[5] The date of Russian Orthodox Christmas in 2023, after all, has been known for centuries. Had Putin been serious about a religiously motivated ceasefire he had ample time to prepare for it. The announcement of a ceasefire within 24 hours of when it is meant to enter into force suggests that it was announced with the intention of framing Ukrainian forces who continue to fight throughout the timeframe of the ceasefire as unwilling to work towards peace and wanting to fight at all costs.\n\nPutins framing of the ceasefire on religious grounds additionally reinforces another two-fold Russian information operation that frames Ukraine as suppressing religious groups and positions Putin as the true protector of the Christian faith. As ISW has previously observed, the Kremlin has weaponized discussions of Eastern Orthodox Christianity to accuse Kyiv of oppressing religious liberties in Ukraine.[6] Russian sources have recently picked up on raids carried out by the Ukrainian State Security Service (SBU) against Russian Orthodox churches and clergy members and Ukrainian sanctions against Kremlin-linked elements of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Moscow Patriarchate (UOC MP).[7] These measures are not efforts to suppress religious liberties in Ukraine but rather are aimed at explicitly pro-Kremlin elements of the Russian Orthodox Church that have materially, politically, and spiritually supported Russian aggression against Ukraine.[8] The invocation of a ceasefire on distinctly religious grounds in line with Russian Orthodox Christian tradition is a subcomponent of this information operation. Suddenly announcing a ceasefire with that should have been negotiated well in advance in observance of Russian Orthodox Christmas will allow Russia to frame Ukraine as infringing on the right of believers to celebrate the holiday as hostilities will likely continue into January 6 and 7. This information operation can support the baseless Kremlin narrative that Ukraine was persecuting Orthodox Christians and Russian speakers, a narrative that Putin has repeatedly advanced as justification for his illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe ceasefire announcement positions Putin as the guarantor of Christian values and beliefs. Putin and other Russian officials have frequently framed the war in Ukraine as a religious war against \"Satanic\" and \"fanatical\" elements of Ukrainian society that seek to undermine traditional religious values and morality.[9] Putins proposed ceasefire supports false Russian information operations that Russia is fighting a holy war against an immoral Ukrainian society and its secular Western overseers. In actuality, Russian forces have suppressed religious freedom in occupied Ukrainian territory since 2014.[10]\n\nThe pro-war Russian milblogger information space responded to the ceasefire announcement with vitriolic discontent. Several prominent milbloggers emphasized that Russian soldiers do not want a ceasefire at all and remarked that it is a useless, defeatist ploy that is unlikely to succeed in the first place.[11] One milblogger who was previously embedded with Russian units in Bakhmut and attended the annexation ceremony at the Kremlin in September employed overtly genocidal, dehumanizing rhetoric in response to the ceasefire and stated that Russian soldiers do not want compromise: They \"want to kill every person dressed in the uniform of the enemy army, regardless of gender and the circumstances that forced the subhuman [sic] to wear this uniform.\"[12] This level of vitriol originating from milbloggers who are typically fairly aligned with Putins line on the war is noteworthy and undermines Putins ability to present Russia as the party that is willing to negotiate. Putins continued association with this milblogger community, especially those who frequently openly call for genocide, continues to demonstrate the fact that Putin has not decided to compromise his aims in Ukraine.\n\nPutin reiterated his maximalist objectives in a telephone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on January 5. Putin emphasized that Moscow remains open to negotiations with Kyiv as long as such negotiations \"take into account new territorial realities.\"[13] Accounting for \"territorial realities\" in the context of negotiations means hammering Ukraine into making concessions that directly undermine its territorial sovereignty.[14] NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg also noted on January 5 that there are no indicators that the Kremlins ambitions have changed.[15]\n\nThe use of a ceasefire as an information operation, coupled with Putins continued propagation of maximalist goals in Ukraine, continues to indicate that Putin has no desire to actually negotiate with Ukraine. Additionally, Putins continued alignment with and decision to platform milbloggers who routinely use openly genocidal language and call for unrestrained hostilities offer clear indicators of his intentions along these lines. If and when Putin becomes serious about seeking compromises that Ukraine and the West could seriously contemplate accepting, he will have set conditions with the vocal and prominent nationalist community he is currently empowering and courting. He could threaten, marginalize, de-platform, co-opt, or cajole the pro-war milbloggers into accepting more limited objectives, but such activities would be apparent in the information space. As long as Putin continues to give air and prominence to such extremists, however, it will remain clear that he does not intend to abandon his maximalist aims.\n\nWagner Financier Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed that prisoners who volunteered with the Wagner Group in Ukraine received pardons, likely in a bid to inflate his influence and political power. Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti reported that Prigozhin told reporters that two dozen former prisoners completed six-moth contracts with the Wagner Group fighting in Ukraine and received pardons.[16] Russian sources published footage of Prigozhin holding a ceremony for the Wagner Group personnel at a rehabilitation center in Anapa, Krasnodar Krai, in which he awarded the former prisoners state medals and pardon papers.[17] ISW has not observed any official Russian government source comment on whether the Wagner personnel did indeed receive these pardons. Under the Russian Criminal Code and Article 89 of the Russian Constitution, only the Russian President may issue a pardon to an individual, although regionally based pardon commissions and individuals may petition the Russian President to pardon specific individuals.[18] It is possible that Prigozhin submitted petitions to pardon the former prisoners on their behalf. It is also possible that Prigozhin is claiming that the former prisoners received pardons when in actuality a Russian court may have issued them a \"Release from Punishment\" (a commuting of a prison sentence and/or other criminal punishment) or the State Duma of the Russian Federation granted the former prisoners amnesty.[19] ISW has not observed any official Russian sources report that a Russian court or the State Duma has taken either of these legal actions on behalf of these former prisoners, although it is perfectly possible that they did. Previous reporting suggested that the Wagner Group promised prisoners \"full exemption from their criminal punishment\" and not necessarily that prisoners would receive pardons.[20]\n\nPrigozhin is likely using the ambiguity of the legal status of these former prisoners to create the impression that he is influential enough to be able to secure pardons for Wagner Group personnel. Prigozhin likely publicized the granting of the pardon papers to reflect this supposed influence in support of ongoing efforts to cast himself as the central figure in the ultra-nationalist pro-war community.[21] By appearing to take public credit for pardoning these criminals Prigozhin risks seeming to arrogate to himself powers that only Putin actually wields.\n\nPrigozhin also likely publicized the pardons to strengthen the Wagner Groups ongoing recruitment of prisoners and to assuage current Wagner Group personnels possible concerns about promised legal rewards. US National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby reported on December 22, 2022, that the Wagner Group currently has 50,000 personnel deployed to Ukraine, including 40,000 convicts recruited from Russian prisons.[22] Kirby reported that over 1,000 Wagner Group personnel died in Ukraine in a month, and Russian opposition outlet The Insider reported on November 5 that 500 former prisoners volunteering with the Wagner Group died in Ukraine in two months.[23] The Wagner Group likely needs to replenish its forces after heavy losses, predominantly of former prisoners, and Prigozhin likely publicized the supposed pardons to augment the Wagner Groups recruitment campaign in Russian prisons. Prigozhin also likely publicized the pardons to reassure the reportedly 80 percent of deployed Wagner Group personnel in Ukraine who have been promised some type of legal reward for their participation in hostilities. Prigozhin has increasingly pinned his standing in the Russian ultra-nationalist pro-war community on the Wagner Groups ability to capture territory and, particularly, on its offensive on Bakhmut.[24] Prigozhin likely intends to further motivate Wagner personnel and generate new paramilitary forces in a misguided and implausible effort to reverse the culmination of the Bakhmut offensive.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putins announcement that Russian forces will conduct a 36-hour ceasefire in observance of Russian Orthodox Christmas is likely an information operation intended to damage Ukraines reputation.\n\nPutins framing of the ceasefire on religious ground reinforces another Russian information operation that falsely frames Ukraine as suppressing religious groups and positions Putin as the true protector of the Christian faith.\n\nPutin has not changed his fundamental maximalist objectives in Ukraine.\n\nWagner Financier Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed that prisoners who volunteered with the Wagner Group in Ukraine received pardons, likely in a bid to inflate his influence and political power, strengthen Wagner Groups prisoner recruitment, and reassure Wagner Group criminals in uniform.\n\nRussian forces continued limited counterattacks to regain lost positions along the Svatove-Kreminna line, and Russian forces claimed that Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the area.\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly conducted a successful counterattack as Russian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut and west of Donetsk City.\n\nRussian forces continued to operate sabotage and reconnaissance groups on the Dnipro River and reinforce positions in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast.\n\nRussian milbloggers claimed recent Russian successes in Zaporizhia Oblast, likely to distract from the slow Russian offensive around Bakhmut that may be culminating.\n\nMobilized Russian servicemembers likely continue to represent an outsized portion of Russian military casualties in Ukraine.\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian CounteroffensivesEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and one supporting effort)\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortCapture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting EffortSouthern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast)\n\nRussian forces continued limited counterattacks to regain lost positions along the Svatove-Kreminna line on January 5. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian assault near Stelmakhivka (16km northwest of Svatove).[25] A Russian milblogger claimed that battles in the past week between Ukrainian and Russian forces northwest of Svatove have been positional in nature and that control of terrain has not changed.[26] The Ukrainian General Staff also reported that Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian assault near Ploshchanka (17km northwest of Kreminna).[27] A Russian milblogger claimed that elements of the 3rd Motorized Rifle Division of the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army of the Western Military District have been conducting an offensive or a very active defense along the Ploshchanka-Makiivka line (22km northwest of Kreminna) for the past few weeks.[28] Another Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces are trying to push Ukrainian forces back from positions near the R-66 (Svatove-Kreminna) highway and that fighting is the fiercest near Chervonopopivka (6km north of Kreminna).[29] The Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian artillery units can currently interdict all Russian movements on the highway and that Russian forces intend to resume movements along the highway after pushing Ukrainian forces further back.[30] Luhansk Oblast Head Serhiy Haidai stated on January 5 that Russian forces transferred mobilized servicemembers and Wagner Group personnel to the Kreminna area out of fear that the tactical situation in the area was worsening.[31] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces also conducted an assault towards Bilohorivka, Luhansk Oblast (12km south of Kreminna).[32]\n\nRussian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the directions of Svatove and Kreminna on January 5. A Russian milblogger claimed on January 5 that Ukrainian forces regularly conduct night raids on Russian positions near Kuzemivka (15km northwest of Savtove) intending to exhaust Russian combat power in the area.[33] A BARS-13 (Russian Combat Reserve) affiliated source claimed on January 5 that Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups routinely attempt to penetrate Russian positions in the direction of Svatove.[34] A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces are attempting to cut a section of the R-66 highway that leads into Kreminna near Chervonopopivka, where both Russian and Ukrainian forces have been conducting assaults and counterattacks in the past week.[35] Another Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces unsuccessfully attempted to advance towards Russian positions in the Kreminna area on January 5.[36]\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly conducted a successful counterattack as Russian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut on January 4 and 5. The Ukrainian State Border Guards Service reported on January 4 that Ukrainian soldiers conducted a tactical counterattack in Bakhmut and advanced 300 meters in an unspecified area, forcing Russian troops to withdraw from certain unspecified positions.[37] Russian sources refuted this report and claimed that Russian troops have advanced northeast and south of Bakhmut and made gains within Bakhmut itself.[38] The Ukrainian General Staff stated on January 5 that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks on Bakhmut itself; northeast of Bakhmut near Bilohorivka (22km northeast), Soledar (10km northeast), Krasna Hora (5km north), Vyimka (25km northeast), and Pidhorodne (5km northeast); and south of Bakhmut near Kurdyumivka (12km southwest), Mayorsk (20km south), and Pivnichne (20km southwest).[39] Geolocated footage posted between January 4 and 5 indicates that Russian troops have made marginal advances south of Bakhmut near Opytne (3km south of Bakhmut) and Kurdiumivka.[40] Russian milbloggers claimed that Wagner Group forces expanded their control over certain urban areas on the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut.[41] Former commander of militants in Donbas in 2014 and prominent milblogger Igor Girkin noted that this sector of the front is a \"mutual meatgrinder of attrition\" for Ukrainian and Russian troops.[42]\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations along the western outskirts of Donetsk City on January 5. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian troops attacked near Vodiane, Krasnohorivka, Vesele Marinka, and Pobieda, all ranging along the northern to southwestern outskirts of Donetsk City.[43] Russian milbloggers continued to remark on urban fighting within Marinka.[44] Geolocated footage posted on January 5 shows the aftermath of a Ukrainian strike on a base used by Chechen fighters in Marinka, indicating that Russian troops hold limited positions along the N15 Donetsk CityZaporizhzhia City highway on the southwestern outskirts of Donetsk City.[45] Russian forces did not conduct any ground attacks in western Donetsk or eastern Zaporizhia oblasts and continued routine shelling in these areas.[46]\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nRussian forces continued to operate sabotage and reconnaissance groups on the Dnipro River and reinforce positions in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast on January 5. Ukrainian Kherson Oblast Military Advisor Serhiy Khlan stated on January 4 that Russian forces are training mobilized personnel in the Henichesk area and transferring more manpower to the area.[47] The Head of the Ukrainian Joint Press Center of the Tavrisk Direction Defense Forces, Yevhen Yerin, stated on January 5 that Russian forces are primarily conducting defensive actions in Kherson Oblast, and only use small sabotage and reconnaissance groups in the Dnipro River and delta islands to probe Ukrainian defenses.[48] Russian sources claimed that Russian forces maintain positions on Velyki Potemkin Island southwest of Kherson City in the Dnipro River delta and that Ukrainian forces previously only briefly landed on the island on January 2.[49] One milblogger claimed that the islands remain contested and that it does not make sense for Russian forces to maintain positions on the islands as they cannot launch an effective amphibious operation without controlling a bridgehead to Kherson City.[50]\n\nRussian milbloggers claimed recent Russian successes in Zaporizhia Oblast on January 5, likely to distract from the slow Russian offensive around Bakhmut that may be culminating and to secure limited positions along the Zaporizhia Oblast frontline. A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces continued to expand their zone of control near Dorozhnyanka (6km south of Hulyaipole), which Russian sources claimed that Russian forces captured on December 31.[51] The milblogger claimed that Russian forces continue to probe Ukrainian defenses in the area and exposed Ukrainian positions in the forest belt east of the T0401 highway between Hulyaipole and Dorozhnyanka.[52] A different milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces do not conduct any offensive operations along the Zaporizhia Oblast frontline and lost their chance to launch an offensive near Vasylivka, Zaporizhia Oblast.[53] Russian milbloggers claimed for months that Ukrainian forces were preparing for an imminent counteroffensive in Zaporizhia Oblast.[54]\n\nUkrainian forces continued to target Russian military assets in rear areas of southern Ukraine. Odesa Military Administration Spokesperson Serhiy Bratchuk amplified reports of an explosion of an S-300 missile warehouse in Radensk, Kherson Oblast, which is within range of Ukrainian tube artillery.[55] Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official Vladimir Rogov claimed that Russian air defenses activated over Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast on January 4.[56] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) confirmed on January 4 a Ukrainian strike in Tokmak, Zaporizhia Oblast, but denied allegations that Russian forces used a hospital in Tokmak as a military facility.[57] The Russian MoD claimed the hospital strike killed a Russian military medic but otherwise did not comment on casualty counts.\n\nRussian forces continued routine fire against areas in Zaporizhia, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts on January 5.[58]\n\nThe head of Ukrainian nuclear energy agency Energoatom, Petro Kotin, stated in an interview published on January 4 that Energoatom does not believe that the International Atomic Energy Agencys (IAEA) efforts to establish a safety and security zone around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) are realistic.[59] Kotin stated that Ukrainian forces will return the ZNPP to Ukrainian control and that Russian forces would have to withdraw from the ZNPP if Ukrainian forces broke through Russian lines and captured Melitopol.[60]\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nOfficial Ukrainian sources continue to report that Russian officials are preparing for another imminent wave of mobilization in Russia and occupied territories in Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 5 that the Russian military-political leadership is taking measures to prevent Russian men from leaving the country during a new mobilization wave in January and that Russian officials are considering a complete foreign travel ban for Russian men of military age.[61] The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on January 5 that Russian forces and occupation officials are preparing for another wave of mobilization in Russian-occupied Zaporizhia Oblast.[62] The Resistance Center reported that Russian occupation officials have introduced new restrictions on movement that require residents in Berdyansk and Melitopol to obtain permission from local military commandant's offices in order to leave the cities.[63] Russian occupation officials likely introduced the measures to prevent military-age men from fleeing the upcoming wave of mobilization. ISW reported on December 31, 2022, that Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov stated that he knew \"for a fact\" that the Kremlin plans to close all Russian borders for military-age men, declare martial law, and begin another wave of mobilization in January.[64]\n\nMobilized Russian servicemembers likely continue to comprise an outsized portion of Russian military casualties in Ukraine. BBC Russian Service reported on January 2 that it has confirmed open-source data for the identities of 538 mobilized Russian servicemembers killed in Ukraine.[65] BBC Russian Service noted that real casualties among mobilized Russians servicemembers could be much higher, as many reports on Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine since October 2022 do not indicate the status of the servicemembers.[66] ISW reported on December 9, 2022, that the BBC Russian Services ongoing open-source investigation into the identities of confirmed Russian casualties with independent Russian outlet Mediazona had identified over 400 mobilized Russian personnel killed in Ukraine.[67] BBC Russian Service noted that the more than 100 confirmed Russian mobilized personnel killed in Ukraine since early December 2022 does not account for the large number of mobilized personnel that were killed in a Ukrainian strike on a Russian base in Makiivka, Donetsk Oblast on December 31, 2022.[68] The breakdown of the confirmed mobilized personnel killed in Ukraine shows that certain Russian oblasts are overrepresented, matching the pattern the BBC Russian Service has reported for all confirmed Russian servicemembers killed in Ukraine.[69] ISW assesses that the overrepresentation of certain Russian oblasts in casualty figures is partially a result of Russian force-generation efforts that have focused on specific Russian regions.[70] Shortages of professional soldiers in combat operations, poor training, and Russian commanders lack of regard for the lives of mobilized Russian personnel may also account for the recent predominance of mobilized personnel in confirmed Russian casualty figures in Ukraine.\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nRussian forces and occupation authorities are continuing to intensify filtration measures in occupied territories. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on January 5 that Russian forces are prohibiting movement within occupied Zaporizhia Oblast and are only permitting those with permits to leave occupied territories.[71] Ukrainian Kherson Oblast Administration Advisor Serhiy Khlan stated on January 5 that Russian forces are prohibiting civilians in occupied Kherson Oblast from leaving occupied territories until January 15.[72]\n\nRussian occupation authorities are continuing passportization efforts in occupied territories. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 5 that Russian occupation authorities have shortened the process to receive Russian passports in Horlivka, Donetsk Oblast, from 30 to 10 days.[73] The Ukrainian General Staff also stated on January 5 that Russian occupation authorities are continuing to forcibly passportize citizens in occupied territories and that banking institutions in Luhansk Oblast require Russian passports to issue bank cards.[74]\n\nRussian authorities are continuing to take measures to consolidate legal and administrative control of occupied territories. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed and implemented a decree (N984) to simplify procedures to allow Ukrainian collaborators to join the occupation civil service by abolishing psychological screening and personal recommendations from other civil servants.[75] The decree also provides that newly-hired collaborators may undergo medical examinations in absentia.[76] The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 5 that Russian occupation authorities in Donetsk Oblast are issuing citizens Russian license plates and drivers licenses.[77]\n\nRussian forces and occupation authorities continued to seize and repurpose civilian infrastructure to support Russian military activities in occupied territories on January 5. Luhansk Oblast Head Serhiy Haidai stated on January 5 that Russian forces coerced farmers in Bilovodsk, Luhansk Oblast to abandon their hangers in order to accommodate Russian servicemen and personnel.[78] Haidai also stated that Russian occupation authorities are continuing to seize and repurpose civilian hospitals to treat Russian and Wagner Group servicemen throughout Luhansk Oblast.[79]\n\nRussian occupation authorities are continuing to take measures to incentivize Ukrainian citizens to move to occupied territories. Russian officials passed a resolution on January 3 on the provision of a two percent rate on mortgage loans for residents in occupied territories.[80] Kherson Occupation Administration Head Vladimir Saldo stated on January 5 that the new planned city on the Arabat Spit will need new residents and that preferential mortgages will make housing there much more affordable.[81] Russian occupation authorities likely seek to increase the population in the deep rear in occupied territories to strengthen production capabilities and support logistics related to Russias invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussian occupation authorities continued making efforts to consolidate economic control of occupied territories on January 5. Ukrainian Kherson Oblast Administration Advisor Serhiy Khlan reported on January 5 that Russian occupation officials are allowing Ukrainian civilians to exchange the Ukrainian hryvnia for Russian rubles at select banks in occupied Kherson Oblast in accordance with proposed rates.[82]\n\nRussian forces and occupation authorities are continuing to take measures to identify possible partisans in occupied territories. Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov stated on January 5 that Russian forces conceal themselves in civilian clothing before entering supermarkets and other public places in Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast, in an effort to identify possible partisans.[83]\n\nISW will continue to report daily observed indicators consistent with the current assessed most dangerous course of action (MDCOA): a renewed invasion of northern Ukraine possibly aimed at Kyiv.\n\nISWs December 15 MDCOA warning forecast about a potential Russian offensive against northern Ukraine in winter 2023 remains a worst-case scenario within the forecast cone. ISW currently assesses the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine from Belarus as low, but possible, and the risk of Belarusian direct involvement as very low. This new section in the daily update is not in itself a forecast or assessment. It lays out the daily observed indicators we are using to refine our assessments and forecasts, which we expect to update regularly. Our assessment that the MDCOA remains unlikely has not changed.

Other, unconfirmed reports put the death toll much higher.\n\nThe Strategic Communications Directorate of Ukraines armed forces claimed Sunday that around 400 mobilized Russian soldiers were killed in a vocational school building in Makiivka and about 300 more were wounded. That claim couldnt be independently verified. The Russian statement said the strike occurred \"in the area of Makiivka\" and didnt mention the vocational school.\n\nSatellite photos analyzed by The AP show the apparent aftermath of the strike. An image from Dec. 20 showed the building standing. One from Jan. 2 showed it in ruins. Other days had intense cloud cover, making it impossible to see the site by standard satellite imagery.\n\nVigils for soldiers killed in the strike took place in two Russian cities Tuesday, the state RIA Novosti agency reported.\n\nIn Samara, in southwestern Russia, locals gathered for an Orthodox service in memory of the dead. The service was followed by a minutes silence, and flowers were laid at a Soviet-era war memorial, RIA reported.\n\nUnconfirmed reports in Russian-language media said the victims were mobilized reservists from the region.\n\nWith the fighting raging much longer than anticipated by the Kremlin, and becoming bogged down in a war of attrition amid a Ukrainian counteroffensive backed by Western-supplied weapons, Russian President Vladimir Putin is mulling ways of regaining momentum.\n\nIn a video address late Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country needs to strengthen its defenses in the face of what he described as Russian plans for a new offensive.\n\n\"There is no doubt, that todays bosses of Russia will gather all they can to try to reverse the battlefield situation or at least delay their defeat,\" he said. \"We must derail that Russian scenario and are getting ready for it.\"\n\nIn comments a day earlier, Zelensky had claimed the Kremlin plans to step up the use of Iranian-made exploding drones.\n\n\"We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack by Shaheds (exploding drones),\" he said Monday night.\n\nZelensky said the goal is to break Ukraines resistance by \"exhausting our people, (our) air defense, our energy.\"\n\nFor the Russian military, the exploding drones are a cheap weapon which also spreads fear among the enemy. The United States and its allies have sparred with Iran over Tehrans role in allegedly supplying Moscow with the drones.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said Putin is striving to strengthen support for his strategy among key voices in Russia.\n\n\"Russias air and missile campaign against Ukraine is likely not generating the Kremlins desired information effects among Russias nationalists,\" the think tank said late Monday.\n\n\"Such profound military failures will continue to complicate Putins efforts to appease the Russian pro-war community and retain the dominant narrative in the domestic information space,\" it added.\n\nMeanwhile, drone advances in Ukraine have accelerated a trend that could soon bring the worlds first fully autonomous fighting robots to the battlefield. Experts say it may be a matter of time before Russia or Ukraine deploy them.\n\nPutins additional reliance on currently available drones might not help him achieve his goals, however, as Ukraine claims a high success rate against the weapons. Even so, part of the intention of using drones is to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses.\n\nDuring the first two days of the new year, which were marked by relentless nighttime drone attacks on Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure, the countrys forces shot down more than 80 Iranian-made drones, Zelensky said.\n\nSince September, Ukraines armed forces have shot down almost 500 drones, Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat claimed in a television interview Tuesday.\n\nAs well as seeking to wear down resistance to Russias invasion, the long-range bombardments have targeted the power grid to leave civilians at the mercy of biting winter weather.\n\nIn the latest fighting, a Russian missile strike overnight on the city of Druzhkivka in the Donetsk region wounded two people, the deputy head of Ukraines presidential office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported Tuesday.\n\nThe Russian military on Tuesday acknowledged strikes on Druzhkivka and Kramatorsk, also in Donetsk. The Defense Ministry claimed it destroyed four HIMARS launchers in the area. This claim could not be independently verified.\n\nA reporter with French broadcaster TF1 was live on television screens when a blast from one of the strikes erupted behind him in Druzhkivka. A German reporter with Bild newspaper suffered a minor injury from shrapnel in the same bombardment.\n\nOfficials said the attack ruined an ice hockey arena described as the largest hockey and figure skating school in Ukraine.\n\nIn recently retaken areas of the southern Kherson region, Russian shelling on Monday killed two people and wounded nine, Khersons Ukrainian governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said Tuesday. He also said two people were killed in the Kherson region Tuesday after driving over a mine.\n\nIn other developments Tuesday:\n\nUkraines main security service said it was bringing criminal charges against two high-ranking Russian commanders accused of overseeing strikes against civilians.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine said on its website that it had collected a \"high-quality body of evidence\" against Sergei Kobylash, commander of Russias long-range aviation force, and Igor Osipov, the former head of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The two are charged under Ukrainian law with violating the countrys territorial integrity and with \"planning, preparing, initiating and conducting a war of aggression,\" which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nAlthough it is unlikely that Kyiv will be able to bring Kobylash and Osipov to trial in the near future, the announcement marks the first time Ukrainian authorities brought charges linked directly to attacks on residential areas and civilian infrastructure.\n\nUkraines chief military officer, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said he had his first phone call this year with US Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nZaluzhnyi said on Facebook that he told Milley about heavy battles around Svatove-Kreminna and in the direction of Lysychansk. \"The most difficult situation remains in the Soledar-Bakhmut-Mayorsk area,\" he said, adding that the Russians are trying to advance by \"effectively marching on corpses of their own.\" He said Ukrainian forces securely keep their defenses in the Zaporizhzhia region and make efforts to protect Kherson from Russian shelling, while the situation along the border with Belarus is fully controlled.",

Two comrades who also had been trying to infiltrate Ukrainian positions had been killed, their bodies lay nearby. Others, injured, had made it back to the Russian base.\n\nThe Wagner contingent on the frontline, said Talat, a young Uzbek, were running short of ammunition, supplies were not arriving, fire support they were promised had not materialised: morale was very low.\n\nParading the prisoner in front of me and another journalist, that is what his Ukrainian captors wanted to hear. This was precisely what their own intelligence suggested, they nodded sagely. \"We are going to be taking back the areas Wagner have occupied, they are in poor shape, we are ready,\" said a captain of the 93rd Brigade. \"A lot of them will not live, this man is lucky we got him really. He will be taken to hospital for treatment.\"\n\nThe Wagner fighter muttered wryly: \"They will shoot me when you guys are gone.\" He asked for a cigarette. Lighting him one, a Ukrainian soldier grinned. \"We should put you out of your misery, but dont worry, we are not going to,\" he said. Talat, in the event, was not executed, I saw him a few days later at a hospital in Dnipro. But the Ukrainian advance did not take place either both sides were stalled in attritional street fighting, gaining little.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, the boss of Wagner, was keen to dampen expectations back in Moscow at the time. \"The situation near Bakhmut is difficult. The Ukrainian troops are putting up decent resistance, and the legend of the fleeing Ukrainians is just a legend,\" he said in a Telegram post. \"Ukrainians are guys with the same iron balls as us\".\n\nThree months on, Wagner-led Russian forces have at last made a breakthrough in the Donbas, taking over most of the salt-mining town of Soledar, north of Bakhmut, giving them a strategic leverage as well as a propaganda victory. While fighting continues, the gains are the Kremlins only battlefield success since the summer.\n\nDramatic video captures medical evacuation amid fighting in Soledar\n\nAs they moved through the town to secure a network of underground tunnels, the Wagner group said they had found the body of one of two men from Britain 48-year-old Andrew Bagshaw and Chris Parry, 28 who have been missing in the area, although they did not name which one.\n\nThe gains in Soledar have added to the claims by Prigozhin that his men are a far more effective force than many of Moscow's regular military units. There are currently 50,000 of the companys mercenaries in Ukraine, some of them recruited from prisons, comprising a quarter of total Russian strength more are being prepared for deployment in the near future.\n\nPrigozhin, nicknamed \"Putins chef\" due to his ownership of a catering business with Russian government contracts, is a long-term confidante of the Russian president. He had been relatively low-profile while Wagner had deployed on behalf of the Kremlin in arenas including Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic, and recently Mali.\n\nOver the last few months, however, Prigozhin has repeatedly sought the limelight, attacking the Kremlin military hierarchy over strategy and tactics, with Ukraine having made steady progress in the field as Russian forces faltered. He has been joined in the strident criticism by Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen ruler, whose troops are also in Ukraine. As well as some of Russias hawkish and influential military bloggers.\n\nA Ukrainian army Grad multiple rocket launcher fires rockets at Russian positions along the frontline near Soledar (AP)\n\nKadyrov has praised Prigozhin his \"dear brother\" and advised his fighters, who number 20,000 overall and are formally a part of Rosgvardiya, the Russian National Guard, to pay \"close attention\" to what the Wagner chief has to say.\n\nThe frequency with which senior Russian officers have been moved during the Ukraine invasion indicates that President Putin continues to be dissatisfied with the way it is being run. The latest to be replaced is General Sergei Surovikin, who lost his role as head of what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" to General Valery Gerasimov, the countrys military chief, after just three months.\n\nSurovikin, a former commander of Russias air force, had been lauded by the pro-Kremlin media as \"General Armageddon\" for his aggressive strategy in Syria, including the pulverising bombing of Aleppo. The campaign of hitting Ukraines civilian infrastructure was initiated by the general. However, the damaging effect of that lessened with more drones and missiles being intercepted before they reach their targets.\n\nRussias Defence Ministry said the appointment of General Gerasimov was to ensure \"closer contact between different branches of the armed forces and improving the quality and effectiveness of the management of forces\".\n\nThere have, however, been reports of disagreements between Surovikin and Gerasimov as well as the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. In this internal power struggle Prigozhin has been a supporter of Surovikin and a critic of Shoigu.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin serves food to Vladimir Putin at Prigozhin's restaurant outside Moscow in 2011 (AP)\n\nThe boss of Wagner has many enemies in Moscow, and they are believed to have been behind negative stories which have surfaced recently. The most prominent have been tales about Prigozhin's time in prison while he was serving a 13-year sentence on charges of aggravated burglary and robbery.\n\nIn one video, a man, covered in prison tattoos and calling himself Sasha Kurara, claimed Prigozhin was his \"b****\" and that of other gangland heads while incarcerated. \"He knew his place and agreed to his place,\" said the supposed crime boss.\n\nPrigozhins allies have sought to dismiss the allegations as smears an indication of how those who oppose him are worried by his growing power.\n\nIt is unclear what effect the divisions and acrimony in the Russian military hierarchy will have on the ground.\n\nTaking control of Soledar would enable access to 120 miles of tunnels which could be used to move troops and weapons. Prigozhin has highlighted the advantage of the underground passages. \"They can hold a big group of people at a depth of 80 to 100 metres, and also tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. They can be stored but also be moved through them,\" he has said.\n\nMembers of the Ukrainian armys 43rd Heavy Artillery Brigade fire from tanks near Soledar (Reuters)\n\nControl of Soledar will also provide vantage points for further artillery strikes on Bakhmut. Capturing Bakhmut will not only be a symbolic triumph but could pave the way for an assault on the main Donbas cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk.\n\nWagner has secured an array of weaponry including Su-25 aircraft, T-90 tanks, S-300 missile systems, TOS-1A thermobaric rocket launchers, 23mm heavy artillery and Pantsir air defence missile systems for its Ukraine mission. Last month, the White House said that the group was spending $100m a month in Ukraine, with John Kirby, spokesperson for the US National Security Council, saying the group had taken delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea. The company has also set up training and recruitment centres parallel to the Russian defence ministry in Belgorod and Kursk.\n\nNo other private army in the world has such an arsenal, and Wagner is expected to play a major role in a new campaigning season which will get under way after the winter hiatus. Both sides are planning offensives.\n\nWeapons are also the subject under discussion by Ukraines allies. Western-supplied Himar and MLRS rocket launchers turned the tide in Ukraines favour in the Donbas and the south during the summer, and more of these systems are due to be sent.\n\nRecommended\n\nArmoured fighting vehicles like the American Bradleys, German Marders and French AMXs are also on the way, and the UK has announced that it will supply a small number of Challenger 2 battle tanks. Berlin is under pressure from allies to allow the transfer of German-made Leopard 2 tanks, in service with European armies, to Kyiv.\n\nThe arrival of armour especially tanks and artillery will have a huge impact in the coming months, and play a significant part in deciding what happens to Vladimir Putins war in the heart of Europe. As well as to those, like Yevgeny Prigozhin, seeking to amass power amid the carnage.",

But the Kremlin's forces appeared to have made progress in Soledar in recent days.\n\nRussian soldiers and fighters from the Wagner mercenary group were likely in control of most of Soledar, 6 miles northeast of Bakhmut, the British Defense Ministry said in its daily intelligence briefing on the war Tuesday. The move to take Soledar was, it said, \"highly likely an effort to envelop Bakhmut from the north, and to disrupt Ukrainian lines of communication.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the soldiers who were resisting Russian advances in a statement late Monday.\n\n\"It is extremely difficult there are almost no whole walls left,\" he said. \"Due to the resilience of our warriors there, in Soledar, we have gained additional time and additional power for Ukraine.\"\n\nZelenskyy said that in the area around Soledar and Bakhmut, \"everything is completely destroyed. There is almost no life left.\"\n\n\"The whole land near Soledar is covered with the corpses of the occupiers and scars from the strikes,\" he added. \"This is what madness looks like.\"\n\nOn some days. both sides have exchanged several thousand artillery rounds in the area, in trench fighting described as \"savage\" and compared to the carnage of World War I by a U.S. military official in a background briefing to journalists Monday.\n\nUkraines military said Monday that Russia made a \"desperate attempt to storm the city of Soledar from different directions and threw the most professional units of the Wagnerites into battle.\"\n\nSerhiy Cherevaty, a spokesman for Ukraines eastern forces, told Ukrainian TV that Soledar was hit by 86 shells Tuesday alone.\n\n\"There are fierce battles now, and the enemy has concentrated there the best units of the organized criminal group Wagner, which are supported by the regular armed forces of the Russian Federation,\" he said.\n\nThe Moscow-backed leader of the occupied areas of Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state TV on Tuesday that Russian forces were \"very close\" to taking Soledar but that the gains were coming at a high price. Taking the town would create \"good prospects\" to then take Bakhmut, he said.",

But the Russian Defense Ministry had stopped short of announcing the news and made no mention of Wagner fighters' role.\n\nWagner mercenary group fighters in a photo said to be in Soledar and released Wednesday. Concord / Telegram\n\nMoscow eventually said it had captured the town in a statement early Friday.\n\n\"On the evening of January 12, the liberation of the city of Soledar was completed, which is important for the continuation of successful offensive operations in the Donetsk direction,\" defense ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said.\n\nHaving not not mentioned Wagner in its initial communication claiming to have captured Soledar, Russia's defense ministry issued a second statement \"to clarify\" the situation.\n\nIt said the \"mission was successfully accomplished by the courageous and selfless actions of the volunteer assault units of the Wagner private military company.\"\n\nBut Kyiv pushed back. Serhiy Cherevaty, the spokesman of the Eastern Group of the Ukrainian army, said in an interview that the claim was not true and that fighting was still ongoing in Soledar as of early Friday.\n\nThe head of the local Ukrainian administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said earlier this week that only 500 people were left in the town, most of them elderly.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThe status of Soledar known for its extensive underground tunnels and salt mines has been unclear for days.\n\nThe town lies in the eastern Donetsk region, one of four that Putin claimed to have annexed last year despite failing to fully control. After the Russian retreat from Kherson in the south, the focus of the war moved east through the winter to waves of Russian attacks and artillery battles against Ukrainian positions.\n\nThe capture of Soledar would serve a military purpose while not constituting a turning point in the war, analysts said. It could also fulfil a personal goal of bolstering Prigozhins growing reputation.",

                "cc_text": "The battle over the eastern Ukrainian town of Soledar has been raging for several days now, with claims and counter-claims about whether Russia now has full control there.\n\nAs of the evening of January 11, Soledar was at best under partial control of the Wagner group of mercenaries, according to an assessment by the US-based Institute for the Study of War and the UK Ministry of Defence.\n\nBut heavy Russian bombardment into January 12 confirmed Ukrainian assessments that fighting over the town remained intense.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, this particular battle and several other developments around it is instructive for a broader understanding of where the war in Ukraine is and where it might be headed.\n\nThree particular lessons stand out. First, even small territorial gains are enormously costly in personnel and materiel, and they are only achievable after protracted fighting that inflicts significant losses on both sides and ties up substantial resources. If Russia is eventually able to capture Soledar, it will do so only after razing the town to the ground.\n\nControlling Soledar will, if anything, only be a stepping stone towards the much bigger prize of nearby Bakhmut, one of the last big cities in Donetsk oblast that has not been captured by Russia. Yet, here Ukrainian forces remain firmly in control. Even if Russia were to succeed with its efforts in Soledar, the predicted collapse of Ukrainian defences in the Donetsk region or a strategic withdrawal are by no means foregone conclusions.\n\nEPA-EFE/Maxar Technologies handout\n\nThe second insight that can be gleaned from the battle for Soledar and the broader context in which it takes place is that both sides maintain maximalist objectives and seem generally unwilling to engage in efforts towards a negotiated settlement. This is despite a recent meeting between the human rights commissioners of Russia and Ukraine, Tatiana Moskalkova and Dmytro Lubinets, in Ankara at which another prisoner exchange was agreed and in which both sides agreed to continue their humanitarian dialogue.\n\nFrom the Russian perspective, the massive onslaught against Soledar and the ongoing battles elsewhere along the frontline between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Donetsk oblast are extremely costly in terms of troops and munition. They only make sense if the Kremlins aim remains the occupation of all of the four regions Russia annexed after sham referendums back in September.\n\nRead more: Ukraine war: west condemns 'sham' referendums in Russian-occupied areas\n\nAs fighting has intensified on the ground, so it has between different Russian political factions. On the one hand, the assault on Soledar was led by forces of the Wagner group, headed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nPrigozhin may have been, in part, motivated by the prospect of gaining access to the nearby salt and gypsum mines. But he also used his apparent success on the battlefield to shore up his influence in Putins inner circle. He has not held back from scathing criticism of the efforts of the top brass of the Russian military.\n\nWhile Prigozhin may yet win the battle over Soledar, he lost the arguably more political battle when his close ally Sergei Surovikin the main architect of the campaign to destroy critical Ukrainian infrastructure was replaced on January 11 by the chief of the Russian general staff, Valery Gerasimov, as overall commander for the war in Ukraine. Gerasimov was the architect of the original Russian invasion back in February last year. So his appointment is another signal that Putin has not given up on his maximalist war aims.\n\nThis, in turn, raises the spectre of the opening of a second front in the war. During a visit to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky warned again of the dangers of an invasion from Belarus. In light of recently beefed-up defence cooperation between Moscow and Minsk and planned joined military exercises at the end of January, this remains a significant threat to Ukraine.\n\nRead more: Ukraine war: Putin's Belarus visit ends with talk of increased defence cooperation and nuclear sabre-rattling\n\nSurovikins replacement with Gerasimov also comes at a time when the relentless campaign of drone and missile attacks against Ukraine appears to have ended without achieving its aim of breaking Ukrainians defensive spirit. This may partly indicate depleted Russian stocks of weapons and ammunition. But together with the intensifying ground battles in Donbas it also indicates a renewed Russian focus on the ground war and the expectation of future territorial gains.\n\nEPA-EFE/George Ivanchenko\n\nPutins changes in the military leadership also foreshadow a likely Russian offensive, either in Donbas alone or in Donbas and opening a second front from Belarus. Russias partial, if chaotic, mobilisation took place in the autumn, and has succeeded in its evacuation and redeployment of forces from Kherson in October.\n\nThis has given the Kremlin a significant pool of manpower and the time to regroup forces and train and integrate newly mobilised troops. Together with the prevailing superiority of Russian artillery and air power, this will afford Gerasimov a potential advantage in future offensives.\n\nThe third and longer-term lesson, therefore, is the need for more western support. Commitments to send more air defence systems and battlefield vehicles to Ukraine are an important step. Once delivered, it also signals that the west remains firmly behind Ukraines defence efforts and is backing Kyiv in its aim of restoring full territorial integrity.\n\nBut, given how slow western deliveries have been at times, British, Polish, French and likely German military supplies are unlikely to influence the outcome of the current battle over Soledar.\n\nOn balance, then, the events in and around Soledar over the past week illustrate that no matter the outcome of the current fighting, this is not a turning point. Its another strong indication that the war is likely going to be long and costly.",

There was a lot of heavy shelling.\n\n\"After two hours or so [inside the city], we were given the alert to move by the Ukrainian special forces because according to their intelligence, about 600 Russian soldiers could be seen entering the northeast of Bakhmut and taking up new positions.\"\n\nHeavy losses sustained by both sides\n\nFor days, Kyiv has said its soldiers were holding out in Soledar, in what has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the entire war.\n\n\"This is a difficult phase of the war, but we will win. There is no doubt,\" Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar wrote earlier on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nAl Jazeeras Ali Hashem, reporting from Moscow, said: \"Soledar, according to the Russians, has fallen to their hands, and this is going to be a big push for them to try to take Bakhmut.\"\n\nBattles have been ongoing \"since the truce that was announced by the Russians on the day of Orthodox Christmas\", he said.\n\nWith a new Russian general to lead the war effort in Ukraine and \"what Russians call the liberation of Soledar This means, in the coming days, Russia will be on the assault\", said Hashem.\n\nRussias announcement came after the Wagner Group a Russian mercenary military force heavily involved in the war in Ukraine said its fighters had seized Soledar.\n\n\"The Wagner Group said they were in full control of the town. They even published videos purportedly showing their fighters walking through the town,\" said Hashem.\n\nHundreds of Russian and Ukrainian troops are understood to have been killed in Soledar, which is in Ukraines eastern Donetsk region one of four partly occupied regions in Ukraines east and south which Moscow moved to unilaterally annex in September.\n\nThe town had a pre-war population of about 10,000 people and sits above cavernous salt mines.\n\nUS plays down Soledar capture\n\nOverall, the front lines have barely budged in the two months since Russias last big retreat in the south.\n\nUkraine is rearming for a planned push to drive Russian forces out of more territory, while Moscow is reinforcing its ranks in a bid to keep control of land it has already seized.\n\nThe United States Kyivs foremost ally has said a Russian victory in Soledar or even Bakhmut, a city 10 times larger where the Russians have so far been repelled, would mean little for the overall trajectory of the war.\n\n\"Even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, its not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself, and it certainly isnt going to stop the Ukrainians or slow them down,\" John Kirby, spokesperson for the US National Security Council, told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank in Washington, DC also said the towns fall would not be \"an operationally significant development and is unlikely to presage an imminent Russian encirclement of Bakhmut\".\n\nRussia has \"over-exaggerated the importance of Soledar\", the ISW said, adding that the long and difficult battle for the town has exhausted Moscows forces.",

The deaths included that of a 15-year-old girl, according to officials.\n\nSome 64 others were also wounded.\n\n\"Tragedy!\" said Borys Filatov, mayor of the rocket-making city on the Dnieper River.\n\n\"Ive gone to the site. We will be going through the rubble all night.\"\n\nPictures from the scene showed firefighters putting out a blaze around the carcasses of some cars in Dnipro. A broad chunk of the apartment block was missing, while the exterior of the rest of the building was badly damaged.\n\nTrapped residents were signalling their location under the debris with their mobile phone torches, according to Ukrainian media reports.\n\n\"They keep sending SMS-es,\" Mikhailo Lysenko, deputy mayor of Dnipro said in a social media video. \"We stop our work now and then to keep silence and we hear people scream from underneath the rubble.\"\n\nRegional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said seven children were among the wounded, the youngest three years old.\n\n\"The fate of 26 people is still unknown,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was not yet known how many were under the rubble.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the death toll is growing every hour,\" he said in his nightly address.\n\nThe strikes Russias largest wave of attacks on Ukraine in two weeks came as the country was observing the traditional New Year.\n\nBesides Dnipro, other cities hit on Saturday included Odesa in the south, Kharkiv in the east, Lviv in the west and the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Civilian infrastructure, including electricity sites, were once again damaged and power outages were reported.\n\nEmergency blackouts were applied in \"most regions\" of Ukraine on Saturday due to the raids, Energy Minister German Galushchenko said.\n\nHe warned that the coming days would be \"difficult\".\n\nOfficials said the Kharkiv region lost power completely and that disruptions to electricity and water supplies in Lviv were also possible.\n\nRussia has been targeting Ukraines energy infrastructure with missiles and drones since October, causing sweeping blackouts and disruptions to central heating and running water.\n\nMilitary top commander Valerii Zaluzhny said that Russia fired 33 cruise missiles overall on Saturday, of which 21 were shot down.\n\nUK pledges tanks\n\nMoldova, Ukraines southwestern neighbour, said it had found missile debris on its territory after the latest Russian raids.\n\n\"Russias brutal war against Ukraine directly impacts Moldova again,\" President Maia Sandu tweeted, posting photos of the wreckage.\n\n\"We strongly condemn todays intensified attacks.\"\n\nIn his nightly speech, Zelenskyy appealed to the West to supply more weapons to prevent further deaths from what he described as \"Russian terror\".\n\n\"Whats needed for this? The kind of weapons that our partners have in stockpiles and that our warriors have come to expect. The whole world knows what and how to stop those who are sowing death,\" he said.\n\nSaturdays attack comes as Western powers consider sending heavy weaponry to Kyiv and ahead of a meeting of Ukraines allies in Ramstein in Germany next Friday, where governments will announce their latest pledges of military support.\n\nThe United Kingdom on Saturday became the first Western country to pledge heavy tanks for the war effort, with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak saying his country will send 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine.\n\nSunaks office said the British prime minister believed that a \"long and static war only serves Russias interests\".\n\n\"UK defence and security officials believe a window has opened up where Russia is on the backfoot due to resupply issues and plummeting morale,\" the statement said. \"The Prime Minister is therefore encouraging allies to deploy their planned support for 2023 as soon as possible to have maximum impact.\"\n\nSaturdays attacks came as Ukrainian and Russian forces battled for control of Soledar, a small salt-mining town in eastern Ukraine that for days has been the focus of a relentless Russian assault.\n\nCapturing Soledar, which had a pre-war population of 10,000, could improve the position of Russian forces as they push towards what has been their main target since October, the nearby transport crossroads of Bakhmut.\n\nRussia said on Friday that its forces had taken control of the town, but Ukraine has denied the claim.\n\nAl Jazeeras Charles Stratford, reporting from near Soledar, said there was no obvious sign of a Ukrainian withdrawal from the town.\n\n\"Russia says its taken full control of Soledar, but the smoke rising from impact sites, the explosions from almost constant artillery and heavy machine gun fire suggests otherwise,\" he said.\n\nOn streets leading to Soledar, army medics were waiting at intervals to take the wounded to hospitals away from the front line, said Stratford. Ukrainian armoured personnel carriers were seen carrying troops towards the town, while the tree lines were packed with artillery in defensive positions.\n\nOne soldier appealed for better weapons.\n\n\"It will be hard for us to push them back,\" he told Al Jazeera. \"We will suffer big losses. They move in such great numbers that sometimes our old guns overheat as we try to shoot as many as we can.\"\n\nTurkey said Saturday it was ready to push for local ceasefires in Ukraine and warned that neither Moscow nor Kyiv had the military means to \"win the war\".\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogans foreign policy adviser, Ibrahim Kalin, conceded that it seemed unlikely that the warring sides were ready to strike an \"overarching peace deal\" in the coming months.",

All times EST.\n\n11 p.m.: Russian oil revenues are falling because of the price cap that Western countries imposed on its crude oil shipments and, ahead of further caps on Russia's oil products, Europe is well positioned to manage any price pressures, Reuters reported, citing a U.S. Treasury official said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Group of Seven countries, Australia and the European Union will extend sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine by putting a price cap on its oil products, such as gasoline and diesel, on February 5. The coalition placed a $60 per barrel limit on sea-borne Russian crude oil sales late last year.\n\nRussia is losing a great deal of money daily because of the cap, the senior Treasury official told reporters in a teleconference.\n\n\"For every dollar Russia is not getting in revenue, that's one less dollar they can use propping up their economy, or investing into weapons they need to fight this illegitimate war in Ukraine,\" the official said.\n\n1o p.m.:\n\n9:32 p.m.: The Joint Coordination Center reports that no vessels left Ukrainian ports and no vessels transited through the maritime humanitarian corridor heading toward Ukrainian ports Wednesday under the Black Sea Grain Initiative because of bad weather conditions.\n\nCurrently, 28 vessels are waiting for inspection: Eight of them waiting to move into Ukrainian ports and 20 are loaded with cargo waiting to sail to their global destinations.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the total tonnage of grain and other foodstuffs exported from the three Ukrainian ports remains 16,945,661 metric tons. A total of 1,269 voyages (636 inbound and 633 outbound) have been enabled so far.\n\n8:33 p.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed energy and transport projects with Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi in a telephone call on Wednesday, Reuters reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\nMoscow and Tehran have moved to forge closer relations after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine last February, prompting sweeping Western sanctions. Russia and Iran, which is also under Western sanctions, are among the world's largest oil exporters.\n\nIn a readout of the call, the Kremlin said that the two countries hoped for a \"normalization\" of the situation in Syria, and to \"restore\" the country's territorial integrity.\n\n7:51 p.m.: Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny said Wednesday that he is being refused access to hospital treatment by prison officials after falling sick, in what his team called an underhand attempt to kill him, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nNavalny, the most prominent opponent of President Vladimir Putin, said he had flu symptoms including a fever but was being kept in a punishment cell at his maximum-security prison outside Moscow.\n\nHe also requested during a court hearing on Wednesday that it be postponed because of his illness.\n\n6:54 p.m.:\n\n6 p.m.: Britain's Royal Navy said on Wednesday it was tracking the movements of a Russian warship armed with missiles sailing in international waters in the North Sea, close to Britain, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Escorting warships in UK territorial waters and the adjacent sea areas is routine activity for the Royal Navy,\" the British frigate HMS Portland's Commanding Officer, Commander Ed Moss-Ward, said in a statement.\n\n\"By maintaining a visible and persistent presence, the Royal Navy ensures compliance with maritime law and deters malign activity.\"\n\n5:01 p.m.: Russia has again replaced its top commander in Ukraine, putting army chief of staff Valery Gerasimov in charge of its forces in the conflict, Agence France-Presse reporting, citing the defense ministry on Wednesday.\n\n\"Army General Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian armed forces, has been appointed Commander of the Joint Grouping of Troops (Forces),\" the ministry said.\n\nSergei Surovikin, the commander of Russia's forces in Ukraine for the past three months, will become Gerasimov's deputy.\n\nSurovikin will work alongside two other generals, Oleg Salyukov and Alexei Kim, according to the statement.\n\n4:20 p.m.: Ukraine would be able to win the war in 2023 if it receives more Western weapons, particularly long-range missiles and heavy tanks, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak told AFP Wednesday.\n\nOtherwise, the war will grind on \"for decades,\" Podolyak said, pointing to the bloodiest fighting taking place in eastern Ukraine in Bakhmut and Soledar.\n\n\"Only missiles with a range of more than 100 kilometers will allow us to significantly accelerate the de-occupation of our territories,\" he told AFP in an interview.\n\nThe United States last year supplied Ukraine with missile systems with a range of around 80 kilometers that were credited with turning the tide of the conflict in Kyiv's favor on several fronts.\n\nKyiv has also recently received similar French systems.\n\nBut it is putting pressure on Washington to deliver U.S. ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) missiles, which boast a range of around 300 kilometers.\n\nThese systems would allow Ukrainian forces to target Russian arms depots deep inside Ukrainian territory controlled by Moscow but currently out of range of the weapons in Kyiv's arsenal.\n\n3:27 p.m.: Brokering a deal on a safe zone around Ukraine's Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is getting harder because of the involvement of the military in talks, the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Soviet-era plant, Europe's largest, was captured by Russian forces in March, soon after their invasion of Ukraine. It has repeatedly come under fire in recent months, raising fears of a nuclear disaster.\n\n\"I don't believe that (an agreement) is impossible, but it is not an easy negotiation,\" International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said in an interview with Italian public television RAI.\n\nGrossi, who previously said he hoped to broker a deal on protecting the plant before the end of 2022, said talks with Kyiv and Moscow had become more complicated because they involve not just diplomats, but also military officers.\n\n2:30 p.m.: Rear Admiral Michael Studeman, the commander of Office of Naval Intelligence and director of the National Maritime Intelligence-Integration Office, spoke virtually with the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) on Wednesday, VOAs national security correspondent Jeff Seldin reported.\n\nStudeman spoke about a number of topics and shared several assessments about Russias naval capabilities and its use of naval forces against Ukraine. Seldin shared details of the briefing on Twitter.\n\n2:10 p.m.: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged NATO on Wednesday to do more than just promise Ukraine its door is open at a July summit, saying Kyiv needs \"powerful steps\" as it tries to join the military alliance, Reuters reported.\n\nKyiv requested fast-track NATO membership last September, seven months after Russia invaded Ukraine. NATO says it has an s open-door policy to Ukraine but has not said whether it will accelerate moves towards Kyiv's possible accession.\n\nSuch a move would be likely to touch a nerve in Moscow which casts NATO as a hostile military bloc bent on encroaching on Russia's sphere of influence.\n\n\"For today, just support for Ukraine from colleagues in NATO and support in the form of rhetoric about open doors is not enough for Ukraine. Namely, not enough to motivate our state ... our soldiers,\" Zelenskyy said in the western city of Lviv after talks with the presidents of Lithuania and Poland.\n\n1:40 p.m.: Radio Free Europe/Radio Libertys Ukrainian Service was given access to the Kyiv Heart Institute, where surgeons continue to perform life-saving operations despite blackouts. Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, the institute has had to prepare for all kinds of disasters, including using multiple diesel-powered generators and digging a well to guarantee the supply of water for patients and essential medical services. Despite the challenges, the Kyiv Heart Institute says it performed a record number of surgeries in 2022.\n\n1:05 p.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced his revocation of the citizenship of four Ukrainian lawmakers suspected of treason, including three from a banned pro-Russian party, and signaled more bans were still to come, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported Wednesday.\n\nHe said late on January 10 he took the unusual move against Andriy Derkach, Taras Kozak, Renat Kuzmin, and Viktor Medvedchuk \"based on materials prepared\" by the Ukrainian Security Service and the State Migration Service.\n\nAt least three are outside the country and all have been the target of legal proceedings alleging treason since Russia's unprovoked full-scale invasion began in late February.\n\n\"If people's elected representatives choose to serve not the people of Ukraine, but the murderers who came to Ukraine, then our actions will be appropriate,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation.\n\nHe added that these were \"not the last such decisions.\"\n\n12:25 p.m.: The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said on Twitter Wednesday that it is helping to fund a program aimed at supporting Ukrainian children recover from the trauma of war.\n\n11:50 a.m.: Poland has decided to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine as part of an international coalition, the Polish president said on Wednesday, as Warsaw seeks to play a leading role in reaching a consensus among Western allies on such support, Reuters reported.\n\nKyiv has been requesting heavy military vehicles such as the German-made Leopard 2, which would represent a significant step-up in Western support to Ukraine.\n\n\"A company of Leopard tanks will be handed over as part of coalition-building,\" Andrzej Duda said during a visit to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. \"We want it to be an international coalition.\" A company typically consists of 14 tanks.\n\nDuda said that he hoped that the Polish tanks, together with tanks from other countries, would soon travel to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking alongside Duda, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a joint decision was necessary, as one country would not be able to provide Kyiv with a sufficient number of tanks.\n\n11:30 a.m.:\n\n11:05 a.m.: Roughly eight out of 10 people seeking protection in Germany last year came from Ukraine as part of the largest flight of people in Europe since World War Two, the interior ministry said on Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n\nAfter Russia's invasion in mid-February, 1,045,185 people who fled Ukraine were registered in Germany, it said, adding that most of them were women and children.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's \"criminal war of aggression against Ukraine has triggered the largest flight movement in Europe since World War Two,\" said Interior Minister Nancy Faeser in a statement.\n\nIn addition to the Ukrainian refugees, who do not need to go through an asylum procedure, over 244,000 people filed an asylum application last year, 27.9% more than the year before.\n\nThe majority of asylum applications came from people from Syria, followed by nationals of Afghanistan, Turkey and Iraq.\n\n10: 35 a.m.:\n\n10:10 a.m.: A price cap and European Union embargo on most Russian oil have cut into Moscows revenue from fossil fuels, but the Kremlin is still earning substantial cash to fund its action in Ukraine because the $60-per-barrel cap was \"too lenient,\" The Associated Press reported, quoting the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that he would view such assessments with skepticism.\n\nPeskov noted that in case of lowering the cap, \"Russia will do everything to protect its interests.\"\n\nRussian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday that last years revenue was higher than planned thanks to oil and gas prices exceeding expectations. He said the government used the extra revenue to increase social spending.\n\nWestern governments have struggled to find a way to cut into the fossil fuel income that is the main funding source for Russias government budget and its military action in Ukraine.\n\n9:20 a.m.:\n\n8:45 a.m.: Russia said on Wednesday that the European Union was becoming a vassal of NATO, citing the signing of a joint declaration in which the two organizations pledged to deepen their cooperation in response to Russia's war in Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nIn the declaration on Tuesday, NATO and the EU stated: \"Today, we are faced with the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades. Russias brutal war on Ukraine violates international law and the principles of the U.N. Charter.\" They pledged to \"take our partnership to the next level\" in response to the growing threats and challenges.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the move \"confirms the complete subordination of the European Union to the tasks of the North Atlantic bloc, which is an instrument to guarantee U.S. interests by force.\" She said the Europeans faced \"the unenviable fate of an American vassal, losing their positions in world politics and economics, falling into increasing dependence on Washington with every step.\"\n\nThe statement was in line with Moscow's efforts to cast the war in Ukraine as part of an existential struggle with Western nations it says are bent on Russia's destruction. The United States has denied Moscow's claims that it wants to destroy Russia.\n\n8:20 a.m.:\n\n8 a.m.: NATO and the EU are launching a task force to boost protection of critical infrastructure in response to last year's attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines and Russia's \"weaponizing of energy,\" the organizations' leaders said on Wednesday.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sabotage of the Russia-to-Germany pipelines in the Baltic Sea last September showed the need \"to confront this new type of threat.\"\n\n\"This is a task force where our experts from NATO and the European Union will work hand-in-hand to identify key threats to our critical infrastructure, to look at the strategic vulnerabilities that we do have,\" she said in Brussels, speaking alongside NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nWestern and Russian officials have traded accusations over the Nord Stream blasts, but officials in Sweden and Denmark investigating the attack have not named any possible culprits.\n\n7:50 a.m.: Estonia has told Russia to reduce the number of diplomats at its embassy in Tallinn by February, the Baltic country's foreign ministry said on Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n\nIt said in a statement Russia should lower the number of diplomats to eight, which equals the number of Estonian diplomats in Moscow, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Tallinn on its website lists 17 diplomats.\n\nSince the Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Estonia has already expelled three diplomats.\n\n\"In light of the fact that during the war of aggression, the staff of the Russian embassy is not engaged in advancing Estonian-Russian relations, it is our view that there are no grounds for the current size of the Russian embassy,\" the ministry said on Wednesday.\n\n7:40 a.m.:\n\n7:15 a.m.: Ukraine must \"be ready\" at its border with Russian ally Belarus even though it sees only \"powerful statements\" coming from its neighbor, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday.\n\nReuters reported that Zelenskyy made his comments after visiting the Lviv region, where he discussed border protection and the security situation in northwestern Ukraine.\n\nKyiv has warned that Russia may try to use Belarus to launch a new ground invasion of Ukraine from the north. Zelenskyy made no reference to such warnings in comments on the Telegram messaging app after taking part in what he described as a coordination meeting on security matters in the Lviv region.\n\n\"We discussed state border protection, the operational situation on the border with the Republic of Belarus, and counter-subversive measures in these territories,\" he said.\n\n\"We understand that apart from powerful statements, we do not see anything powerful there, but nevertheless we must be ready both at the border and in the regions.\"\n\n6:45 a.m.:\n\n6:30 a.m.: The fate of Soledar, a devastated salt-mining town in eastern Ukraine, hung in the balance Wednesday as Ukraine said its forces were holding out against a furious Russian onslaught in what has become one of the fiercest and most costly battles in the almost 11-month war, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThough unlikely to provide a turning point in the war, Soledars fall to Russian forces after months of Ukrainian defense would be a prize for the Kremlin.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Russian forces had \"positive dynamics in advancing\" in Soledar, but he stopped short of declaring its capture when asked about the claims that it has come under Russian control. \"Lets not rush and wait for official statements,\" he said.\n\nSoledar, known for salt mining and processing, lies in the Donetsk region and has little intrinsic value. But it lies at a strategic point 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of Bakhmut, which Russian forces are aiming to surround.\n\nTaking Bakhmut would disrupt Ukraines supply lines and open a route for Russian forces to press toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, key Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk.\n\nSoledars fall would make \"holding Bakhmut much more precarious for Ukraine,\" Michael Kofman, the director of Russia Studies at the CAN nonprofit research organization in Arlington, Virginia, noted Wednesday.\n\nThe costly war of attrition, with expected heavy casualties, may make Russias victory as costly as a defeat, however.\n\n6:15 a.m.:\n\n6 a.m.: Russia's human rights commissioner said on Wednesday that \"important words about the need for a ceasefire\" had been said during a meeting with her Turkish and Ukrainian colleagues in Ankara, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported.\n\nReuters reported that Tatiana Moskalkova said that a ceasefire was necessary to stop human rights violations, and that she had also asked Turkey to stop supplying arms to Ukraine.\n\n5:30 a.m.: Belarus's defense ministry said on Wednesday that joint Russian-Belarusian air defense forces had been reinforced, with new missile units moved into position, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Anti-aircraft missile units advanced to designated areas and took up combat duty,\" the ministry said in a brief statement.\n\nBelarus is a close ally of Russia and allowed President Vladimir Putin to use its territory as one of the launchpads for his February 24 invasion of Ukraine. The two countries plan to hold joint aviation drills in the second half of January, beginning next Monday.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly warned that Putin may try to use Belarus to launch a new invasion of Ukraine from the north, a step that would open a major new front in the war.\n\n5:05 a.m.: Reuters reported that Ukraine's military denied on Wednesday that Russian forces had taken control of the eastern town of Soledar, and said the intensity of battles in the area could be compared to fighting in World War II.\n\nSerhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the eastern military command, told Ukrainian television that Ukrainian forces had not allowed Russian forces to break through front lines.\n\n\"The town is not under the control of the Russian Federation. There are fierce battles going on now,\" he said. \"There is a complicated situation there.\"\n\nHe said the military command was \"working now on how to stabilize the situation with the maximum impact for the enemy and minimum losses for Ukraine.\"\n\nRussian mercenary group Wagner has said it has taken control of Soledar, a salt-mining town near the city of Bakhmut where fighting has also been fierce as Russia tries to capture the entire Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"The intensity of battles near Bakhmut can be compared with World War Two,\" Cherevatyi said.\n\nReuters was unable to independently verify the situation on the ground in Soledar.\n\nCherevatyi said Russian forces still had a lot of Soviet-era weapons and were using Soviet-era armored vehicles with some modernized elements.\n\n\"Our partners are providing us with more modern weapons,\" he said, adding that Western weapons were more precise and gave Ukraine an advantage.\n\n4:40 a.m.: Reuters reported that Russian Human Rights Commissioner Tatiana Moskalkova said on Wednesday that Ukraine and Russia had agreed on an exchange of 40 prisoners of war after meeting her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Lubinets.\n\n4:25 a.m.: Ukraine's human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets commented on the Wednesday meeting he held in Turkey with Russian counterpart Tatyana Moskalkova, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThey \"discussed a wide range of humanitarian problems and issues related to the provision of human rights assistance to citizens of the two countries,\" Lubinets said on Facebook, while Moskalkova said in a separate statement that they discussed \"humanitarian aid to citizens of both countries.\"\n\nReuters reported that they were later expected to visit the Turkish presidential palace, where President Tayyip Erdogan is scheduled to make a speech for the conference at 1130 GMT.\n\nA Turkish source said Moskalkova and Lubinets were expected to possibly discuss a humanitarian corridor and the situation of children who fled the war. Issues such as the Black Sea grains corridor or a potential prisoner swap would be discussed at higher levels, the source said.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have conducted numerous prisoner swaps most recently on Sunday in the course of the war, which is now in its 11th month.\n\n3:40 a.m.: Agence France-Presse reported that Kyiv denied Wednesday that forces from Russian mercenary group Wagner had taken the important gateway town of Soledar in east Ukraine, whose capture would pave the way for further gains in Donbas.\n\n\"Soledar was, is and will be Ukrainian,\" the strategic communications branch of the Ukrainian military said in a statement, saying pictures released by the Wagner fighting group that Russian media said were taken in Soledar had been taken elsewhere.\n\n3 a.m.: The fate of the Ukrainian city of Soledar was unclear on Wednesday, with Russian mercenary group Wagner claiming control of it while also saying \"urban battles\" were still being fought, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nBoth sides have said the battle for Soledar, known for its salt mines, has been intense and bloody. Its fall would mark a significant victory for Moscow's forces.\n\nSoledar, in the Donetsk region, lies 15 kilometers (nine miles) from the city of Bakhmut, which Russia has been trying to seize for months.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia's controversial mercenary Wagner group, claimed in the early hours of Wednesday that his fighters seized control of the town.\n\n\"Wagner units have taken control of the whole territory of Soledar,\" Prigozhin alleged on social media.\n\nBut the Kremlin-linked businessman added that \"urban battles are being fought in the city center.\"\n\nHe also said \"the number of captives\" will be announced Wednesday.\n\nHe posted a photograph of himself in military attire, surrounded by Wagner fighters, without saying where it was.\n\nRussian state news agency RIA Novosti published another photograph of Prigozhin with armed fighters, saying it was taken in the salt mines of Soledar.\n\nPrigozhin has said Soledar had been stormed \"exclusively\" by Wagner units.\n\nThe Russian army has not yet commented.\n\nUkraine said this week its fighters were holding out against intense assaults on the city.\n\n\"Even after suffering colossal losses, Russia is still maniacally trying to seize Soledar,\" Kyiv's defense ministry said late on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was a \"difficult situation\" in the Donetsk region in his daily night address on Tuesday. He praised the \"bravery\" of Ukrainian soldiers defending Soledar.\n\nEarlier this week he said Soledar had been flattened by fighting: \"Everything is completely destroyed.\"\n\nThe U.K. said Tuesday that Moscow's forces were \"likely in control\" of Soledar.\n\n2:42 a.m.:\n\n2:05 a.m.: Reuters reported that Russia's Gazprom said that it would ship 35.5 million cubic meters of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Wednesday, a volume broadly in line with recent days.\n\n1:30 a.m.:\n\n1:15 a.m.:\n\n12:55 a.m.: Russian Human Rights Commissioner Tatiana Moskalkova said on Wednesday that she discussed humanitarian assistance with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Lubinets, Reuters reported, citing Moskalkovas post on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n\"We discussed issues of providing humanitarian assistance to citizens of the two countries,\" Moskalkova said Telegram.\n\nLubinets said before the meeting in Turkey that the main issue for the talks was to be \"the return of our heroes and heroines,\" a reference to prisoner exchanges.\n\n12:25 a.m.: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday said his government would purchase a U.S. air defense system to donate to Ukraine, Agence France-Press reported.\n\nThe U.S.-built air defense system is worth $302 million, Defense Minister Anita Anand said.\n\nThe announcement was made after a bilateral meeting between Trudeau and U.S. President Joe Biden in Mexico City.\n\nCanada is offering the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) to Ukraine to counter Russia's massive bombardment of its critical infrastructure, Anand said.\n\n\"Canada will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they fight against Russia's illegal and unjustifiable invasion,\" Anand tweeted.\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Canada had \"vividly proven\" its support.\n\n\"Thank you for helping us to protect our sky.

Picture taken November 11. REUTERS/Misha Japaridze/Pool Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nSummary\n\nCompanies Wagner Group spearheaded assault on Ukraine's Soledar\n\nMercenary chief, in PR push, claims credit for Wagner\n\nDefence ministry initially plays down its success\n\nThen recognises its success after Wagner complain\n\nLONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - In the twilight of the Soviet Union, Yevgeny Prigozhin was languishing in prison for theft. Now as the founder of Russia's most powerful mercenary group, he is vying for Vladimir Putin's favour by claiming a rare battlefield win in Ukraine.\n\nHis aim is to leverage the success that Wagner Group, his mercenary outfit, had this week in pushing Ukrainian forces out of the salt mining town of Soledar, a move that revives Russian plans to seize more of eastern Ukraine after multiple defeats.\n\nRussia claimed victory on Friday, but Ukraine said on Saturday its troops were still battling to hold the town, though open source analysts said its forces had probably been pushed to its edge or out altogether.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the situation.\n\nPrigozhin, 61, who is sanctioned in the West and casts himself as a ruthless patriot, posed in combat gear with his men in a salt mine beneath Soledar and said they had captured it alone.\n\nThe Kremlin praised the \"absolutely heroic selfless actions\" of those fighting in Soledar, but the defence ministry on Friday initially attributed victory to its own airborne units and missile and artillery forces.\n\nPrigozhin reacted with fury, saying Russian officials were not giving his forces due credit.\n\n\"They constantly try to steal victory ... and talk about the presence of other unknown people just to belittle Wagner's merits,\" he complained.\n\nHours later, the defence ministry responded with a statement \"clarifying\" the situation which acknowledged that Wagner fighters, whose actions it hailed as \"courageous\", had been the ones to storm the town.\n\nPrigozhin then moved quickly to start awarding his men with specially struck medals to commemorate the \"taking of Soledar.\"\n\nSome commentators have said Prigozhin could one day be made defence minister, but it is not fully clear how much influence the businessman from St Petersburg has gained with Putin, who tends to balance factions with a strategy of divide and rule.\n\n'A NEW HERO'\n\nSergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, has hailed the shaven-headed mercenary chief as \"a new hero.\"\n\n\"Prigozhin has flaws too. But I won't tell you about them. Because Prigozhin and Wagner are now Russia's national treasure. They are becoming a symbol of victory,\" Markov wrote on his blog, saying they should be given more resources by the state.\n\nMargarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the state-controlled RT channel and close to the Kremlin, thanked Prigozhin for Soledar.\n\nAbbas Gallyamov, a former Kremlin speech writer, suggested on his blog that Prigozhin was manoeuvring in case Putin removed Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, 67, his long-standing ally.\n\nPrigozhin has played down the idea he is seeking official elevation in the past, while not emphatically ruling it out. His press service, and the Kremlin, did not immediately reply to requests for fresh comment.\n\nPutin has said Wagner does not represent the state, is not breaking Russian law, and has the right to work and promote its business interests anywhere in the world.\n\nOne of the military bloggers who help shape Russians' view of the conflict likened Prigozhin to a Roman centurion licensed to operate above and outside the law to achieve Putin's goals.\n\nBut Igor Girkin, a Russian nationalist and former Federal Security Service officer who helped launch the original Donbas war in 2014 and is under U.S. sanctions, has said Prigozhin is careless with the lives of his men.\n\nHe mocked Prigozhin for awarding medals for the capture of what he said was \"a big village\" and said the appointment this week of Russia's top general, an ally of the defence minister, to oversee the Ukraine campaign was a threat to Prigozhin.\n\nThe new commander would look to eliminate pushback to the defence minister from critics like Prigozhin and only direct intervention from Putin could spare him, he predicted.\n\nIf Putin did not intervene, \"Prigozhin will be thrown out of the political arena as well as the military one,\" he forecast.\n\nPrigozhin, nicknamed \"Putin's Chef\" by Western media because he once ran a floating restaurant in St Petersburg where Putin ate, has plenty to gain or lose.\n\nHe has his own future to consider at a time of tumult as well as the commercial interests of Wagner, which Russian officials say has military and mining contracts in Africa and is active in Syria. He also has a vast catering company serving state entities, as well as troll farms and media outlets.\n\n\"In essence, he is a private businessman who is highly dependent on how his relations with the authorities are structured. This is a very vulnerable position,\" said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the R.Politik analysis firm.\n\n'UNSPECIFIED SAFEGUARDS'\n\nRussia has allowed Prigozhin to recruit tens of thousands of convicts from its prisons for Wagner, which U.S. officials say is a 50,000-strong force, and let him equip them with tanks, aircraft and missile defence systems.\n\nIt has also stood by while he flung sometimes profane criticism at the top brass, although some Western military analysts suggested the appointment of the most senior general to lead the war in Ukraine was designed to balance his influence.\n\nBefore Russia's invasion, something Moscow calls \"a special military operation\", Prigozhin had denied his Wagner connection. In September, he said he had founded the mercenary group in 2014.\n\nDespite its sometimes publicly strained ties with the Russian defence ministry, some Western military analysts suspect Wagner is closely affiliated with it.\n\nSome Kremlin critics have said there is a risk Wagner could one day throw off Kremlin control.\n\nOne source close to the Russian authorities, who declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said the Kremlin viewed Prigozhin as a useful operator but maintained unspecified safeguards over leaders of armed groups.\n\n\"There is a ceiling (of growth) and mechanisms in place,\" said the source, who declined to provide more details.\n\nReporting by Andrew Osborn; editing by Philippa Fletcher\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\nRussian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin is fighting his own war in eastern Ukraine, an often crude and increasingly vocal presence in Russias Moscows faltering military campaign.\n\nHe is pitching himself and his Wagner mercenary group as the real patriots, in contrast to what he derides as the corrupt and incompetent military hierarchy. The language is getting harsher, and the stakes higher.\n\nIn the last few weeks, Prigozhin has been seen close to the frontlines in the occupied eastern region of Donetsk, delivering oranges to the troops or grimly reviewing body bags, and engaging with his fighters in unvarnished and sometimes brutal language.\n\nHe rarely misses an opportunity to take a swipe at the establishment. Somewhere in Donetsk last week, Prigozhin told his fighters: \"Once we conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption, then we will conquer the Ukrainians and NATO The problem now is that the bureaucrats and those engaging in corruption wont listen to us now because for New Years they are all drinking champagne.\"\n\nFor Prigozhin, the chief bureaucrat that he has in mind is Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. The two appear to have fallen out over lucrative military contracts given to and then taken from Prigozhins Concord Group, as well as Wagners controversial role in Syria.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Leader of Russia's notorious Wagner group believed to have confronted Putin about the war 02:33 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Ukraine conflict has provided Prigozhin with an opportunity to expand Wagner and proclaim public ownership of the group. Prigozhin said on his Telegram channel last week: \"I created and I manage Wagner PMC. Therefore, the responsibility for any successes or failures lies with me.\"\n\nAfter stepping into the limelight in fall of last year, Prigozhin has contrasted his fighters raw courage with the uninspiring leadership of Shoigu and the military command. After the debacle in Kharkiv in September, when a rapid Ukrainian counteroffensive forced a Russian retreat, Prigozhin said on his Telegram channel that the high command should be forced to fight \"barefoot with machine guns on the front line.\"\n\nShoigu has not been seen at the front and has been widely criticized for the failings of Russias so-called \"special military operation.\" Russian military leaders faced unusually public criticism last week over the deaths of an unknown number of Russian troops in a rocket strike in Makiivka, in eastern Ukraine.\n\nBy contrast, Prigozhin has shown a populist flair with his bravado even taunting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he came to Bakhmut last month.\n\n\"Maybe by the evening well be able to meet,\" he said on Telegram. \"Im sitting, waiting for you near Bakhmut.\"\n\nPrigozhin has also responded to reports that Wagner would be designated a terrorist organization by the US: \"As the saying goes, let sleeping dogs lie. Do not wake Wagner PMC, Americans, while its still sleeping.\"\n\nOff the books\n\nPrigozhin and Wagner have played an unusual and informal role in Vladimir Putins Russia. He has known the president since the 1990s; both are from St. Petersburg. He won valuable contracts as the Kremlins caterer and later set up the Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency, whose mission was to interfere in the US 2016 election.\n\nBut Prigozhin who reportedly did jail time in the 1980s has always been the \"anti-oligarch,\" running his own mercenary operation in Syria and in various African hotspots. Wagner has hired former policemen, soldiers and adventurers and combined training missions in places like the Central African Republic with efforts to win lucrative mineral concessions. For Prigozhin, Wagner is a way to make money and gain influence. For the Kremlin, such operations are a way to get certain things done off the books.\n\nPrigozhin above all is a sharp-eyed opportunist. The Ukraine conflict has given him and Wagner a chance to raise their profile and bring an element to the conflict that the Russian military seems to lack: effective infantry.\n\nWagner were the first Russian troops into the town of Popasna in the spring and then moved into territory in Donetsk as Ukrainian troops withdrew over the summer to what are their present lines.\n\nThe Russian military has been unable to register any territorial gain in the last six months, so for Prigozhin taking Bakhmut or Soledar two towns in Donetsk that have been under attack for months would be both a glittering prize and another chance to overshadow Shoigu.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We can't take it any longer': CNN speaks to Ukrainians living on front line 02:00 - Source: CNN\n\nPrigozhin said Friday that it was \"exclusively\" his troops who have made purported gains around Soledar in recent days. And he added: \"Bakhmut is the central point of the Eastern Front and a serious logistics center. And our task is to die there as little as possible, and to destroy the enemy as much as possible.\"\n\nIn a filmed exchange with his fighters, Prigozhin asked provocatively: \"Other than Wagner PMC, who else is here?\"\n\n\"No one else!\" they replied.\n\nOn Tuesday, Prigozhin reinforced the point as his fighters appeared to take control of part of Soledar.\n\n\"Wagner PMC detachments have taken control of the entire territory of Soledar. The city center is like a cauldron, where urban fighting is taking place,\" he said, before adding: \"I would like to stress that no units other than Wagner PMC operatives were involved in the storming of Soledar.\"\n\nUkrainian forces continue to deny that Soledar has fallen and even Prigozhin has acknowledged that fighting continues there.\n\n(It may not be coincidental that the Soledar area has huge reserves of gypsum, a mineral used in the production of fertilizer and plaster. Prigozhins African adventures have often sought to leverage a military presence for control of mineral wealth, and some Wagner operations in Syria have focused on valuable oil and gas fields.)\n\nPrigozhins ambitions have not gone unnoticed in Washington DC. US Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense Laura Cooper told a briefing Friday: \"In the recent past, weve seen that Wagner is advancing at a more rapid clip than any other unit in the Russian military.\"\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'These guys are really notorious': CNN military analyst on Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine 01:22 - Source: CNN\n\nTheir contract is finished\n\nThe Wagner campaign is brutal and basic. Prigozhin and his lieutenants did a trawl of Russian prisons last year with a straightforward offer: fight in Ukraine for six months and get a pardon instead of going back inside. This unusual bargain appears to have the Kremlins blessing and added more than 30,000 fighters to Wagners ranks, according to prison advocacy groups.\n\nPrigozhin himself addressed a group of prisoners, saying Wagner did not allow alcohol, drugs and \"sexual contacts with local women, flora, fauna, men anything.\" In recent days his own media outlet has shown him meeting former prisoners whose convictions include murder who say they are \"reborn\" and have decided to sign up for another six months.\n\nHe bid farewell to others who had won their pardon. \"They fulfilled their contracts with honor, with dignity,\" he said. And then in typically vernacular fashion he told them, \"Dont drink a lot, dont use drugs, and dont rape any chicks: either make love or pay for it.\"\n\nPrigozhin is not afraid of bad news and he doesnt sugarcoat the Russian campaign. In a video circulated last week through his own media outlet, FAN, he is seen reviewing black body bags piled up in an undisclosed location.\n\n\"They died heroically,\" he said. But he also sounded brutally indifferent, adding: \"Their contract has finished, they will go home next week.\"\n\nUkrainian firefighters extinguish a fire after Russian army shelling of Bakhmut, Ukraine on December 7, 2022. Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nIts unclear how many Wagner contractors have been killed, but losses certainly run into the hundreds in what the Ukrainians call the \"meat-grinder\" of Bakhmut.\n\nSurrounded by Wagner fighters, Prigozhin said early this month on Telegram that Ukrainian forces were turning every house into a fortress. \"So the guys are fighting for every house sometimes fighting for weeks for a single house.\"\n\n\"How many lines of (Ukrainian) defense are there? If we said 500, that would be about accurate, right?\" Prigozhin added.\n\nRussian state media has recently begun to cover Prigozhins appearances on the front line. State news agency RIA Novosti carried an exchange in which his men say they are short of vehicles, munitions and armored personnel carriers.\n\nDays later, Prigozhins Concord Group alleged in a statement that his Patriot media outlet had been asked to publish a negative article about him, while not disclosing who made the request. Through his press service, Prigozhin suggested that \"people in uniform could be discrediting me. Chiefly those close to the military. Because many of them cant achieve the same effectiveness that Wagner has.\"\n\nHe also took yet another swipe at Russias wealthy elite, saying on the Concord Telegram channel: \"The oligarchs days are numbered anyhow, because their negative impact on the future of Russia has been clearly demonstrated during the special operation. Some of them are at war, while others are buying up real estate in Europe.\"\n\nPrigozhins very public campaign, set against the Russian militarys lackluster performance, is not a challenge to Putin himself. Indeed, the Russian leader may find it useful to have someone to snap at the heels of the military establishment. Prigozhin, along with Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, has become Russias licensed disruptor.\n\nMaxim Trudolyubov of Russia File said \"the Russian state does not separate legitimate violence from criminal violence. Its not a bug but a feature, always present but particularly salient now.\"\n\nTrudolyubov tweeted: \"Prigozhin is a bogeyman Putin has created to frighten his elites into good behavior. Putin thus advertises his control of both legitimate and criminal violence.\"\n\nAnalyst Tatiana Stanovaya of R.Politik notes that Prigozhin \"is a private businessman who relies heavily on how his relations with the authorities are structured. As a result, it is a very vulnerable position.\"\n\nStanovaya says its interesting that the governor of Russias Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, has just completed a basic training course with Wagner.\n\nBut Prigozhins end-game is unclear: whether he is making a pitch for serious political influence or simply advancing Wagners sometimes opaque agenda. That may depend on his fighters fortunes in the Donetsk region.",

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nRecent Russian gains in Soledar do not portend an imminent encirclement of Bakhmut, contrary to claims made by Russian sources. Even at the most generous interpretation of Russian milblogger narratives, which claim that Russian forces are fighting on the outskirts of Razdolivka (about 6km northwest of Soledar), Russian forces are still far from being within striking distance of an operational encirclement of Bakhmut.[1] In order to effectively cut Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) into Bakhmut, Russian forces would have to establish control of the T0513 Siversk-Bakhmut highway (currently 7km west of the furthest point of confirmed Russian advances in the Soledar area) and reach the E40 Slovyansk-Bakhmut highway (13km from the furthest point of confirmed Russian advance in the Soledar area) at least. Considering that the recent rate of gains in this area has been on the order of a few hundred meters a day, at most, it is highly unlikely that Russian forces will be successful in cohering a mechanized push towards these GLOCs and move towards encircling Bakhmut.[2] Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut would still have GLOCs available even if the Russians cut the E40, moreover, making the entire discussion of an encirclement at this point bizarre.\n\nRussia continues to weaponize religion to perpetuate long-standing information operations and discredit Ukraine. Russian milbloggers responded to footage posted on January 7 of uniformed Ukrainian servicemen attending Orthodox Christmas services at the Kyiv-Perchesk Lavra and decried it as a reprisal and open war on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Moscow Patriarchate (UOC MP).[3] Several milbloggers referred to the footage as evidence that the Lavra has been \"captured\" by \"heretics and schismatics.\"[4] The milblogger vitriol at the footage of Christmas services at the Lavra follows the decision by the Ukrainian government to take back control of the main cathedral of the Kyiv-Perchesk Lavra from the UOC MP and allow the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) to hold Orthodox Christmas services at the Lavra on January 7.[5] The Russian response to the Ukrainian governments decision to transfer control of the Lavra to the OCU exemplifies Moscows continued weaponization of religion in order to frame Ukraine as evil and position Russia as the protector of Orthodox Christian values, as ISW has previously reported.[6]\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not disrupted the ability of observers to celebrate Orthodox Christmas in Ukraine. Russian milbloggers falsely presented the legal transfer of the Kyiv-Perchesk Lavra from the UOC MP, which the Ukrainian government maintains has explicit links to the Kremlin and has provided material and spiritual support to the Russian war in Ukraine, to the OCU as an attack on the ability of observers of Orthodox tradition to celebrate Christmas. Orthodox services continued through Ukraine, including in the Kyiv-Perchesk Lavra, throughout the course of the day on January 7.[7] The Ukrainian government position that elements of the UOC MP, from which Kyiv removed control of the Lavra, is supported by Russian President Vladimir Putins continued association with the Russian Orthodox Church. In his speech on Orthodox Christmas, Putin thanked the ROC for its continued support for Russian troops in Ukraine.[8] Ukraine is not suppressing the religious liberties of Orthodox Christians, contrary to the Russian information operation, and is instead taking the steps it deems necessary to distance Ukrainian cultural heritage from religious elements it asserts are linked to the Kremlin and its conduct of the war.\n\nRussian forces reportedly continue to deplete their missile arsenal but will likely continue to be able to threaten Ukrainian critical infrastructure and civilians at scale in the near term. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov published an infographic on January 6 detailing that Russian forces have expended roughly 81 percent of their strategic missile stocks and 19 percent of their tactical missile stocks.[9] Reznikov reported that Russian forces reportedly have remaining of their pre-war and post-invasion production stocks:\n\n92 Iskander 9M723 missiles (11 percent),\n\n52 Iskander 9M728/9M729 missiles (44 percent),\n\n118 Kh-101 and Kh-555/55SM missiles (16 percent),\n\n162 Kh-22/32 missiles (44 percent),\n\n53 Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missiles (84 percent), and\n\n59 sea-based Kalibr missiles (9 percent).[10]\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) stated that it would never run out of sea-based Kalibr missiles while conducting a massive series of missile strikes on December 29, 2022.[11] Russian forces last used sea-based Kalibr missiles in Ukraine during their ninth large-scale series of missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure on December 16.[12] Although the Russian militarys tactical missile stock is less expended, S-300 and 3M-55 Onyx missiles are less precise systems than Russian strategic missiles, which is likely why Russian forces have not used these systems extensively in large-scale missile strikes against Ukrainian critical infrastructure.\n\nReznikov reported that Russia has managed to produce since the February 2022 invasion:\n\n290 Kh-101 and Kh-555/55SM missiles (65 percent of the pre-war stock),\n\n150 Kalibr missiles (30 percent of the pre-war stock),\n\n36 Iskander 9M723 missiles (5 percent of the pre-war stock),\n\n20 Iskander 9M728/9M729 missiles (20 percent of the pre-war stock),\n\nand 20 Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missiles (47 percent of the pre-war stock).[13]\n\nThe Russian production of strategic missiles since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in comparison to the Russian military's pre-war stock highlights that Russia has not mobilized its military industry to support Russian military operations in Ukraine. A country would normally increase the production of missile, rocket, and other weapons systems and munitions before embarking on a major war and would normally put its military industry on a war footing once the war began. Russia has done neither. Putins failure to mobilize Russian industry to support the Russian war effort in Ukraine may result from fears that further economic disruptions could produce further domestic discontent in Russia because Western sanctions regimes have placed significant constraints on Russian military industry, or because of inherent limitations of Russian industry and military industryor some combination of these factors. The current level of the Russian militarys depletion of strategic missile systems may constrain how often and at what scale Russian forces conduct future massive series of missile strikes in Ukraine, but Russian forces will be able to continue their campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure at scale in the near term and threaten the lives of Ukrainian civilians.\n\nRussian forces have also reportedly depleted their arsenal of Iranian-made drones following an increased pace of drone attacks in Ukraine in the past month. Russian forces have reportedly expended 88 percent of their stock of the Shahed-131 and 136 drones that they have so far received from Iran, with only 90 Iranian-made drones remaining according to Reznikov.[14] ISW previously assessed that Russian forces increased their use of Shahed drones in attacks on Ukraine over the past month in order to maintain the pace of their campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure without further depleting their more valuable missile stocks.[15] Russias contract with Iran reportedly stipulates that Iran will send an additional 1,000 Shahed drones to Russia.[16] Russian forces will likely be able to conduct only a handful of massive drone attacks in Ukraine in the near term until Russia receives from Iran another delivery of drones, which reportedly come in batches of 200 to 300.[17]\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nRecent Russian gains in Soledar do not portend an imminent Russian encirclement of Bakhmut.\n\nRussia continues to weaponize religion to perpetuate long-standing information operations and discredit Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces reportedly continue to deplete their missile arsenal and stock of Iranian-made drones but will likely continue to threaten Ukrainian infrastructure at scale in the near term.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations near Svatove and Kreminna.\n\nRussian forces made marginal confirmed advances in Soledar amid continuing Russian offensive operations around Bakhmut and along the western outskirts of Donetsk City.\n\nRussian forces continue efforts to establish further control over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).\n\nUkrainian and European officials continue to warn that Russia is preparing for an imminent second wave of mobilization.\n\nRussian occupation authorities continue to transport Ukrainian children to Russian territory under the guise of medical rehabilitation schemes.\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian CounteroffensivesEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and one supporting effort);\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortCapture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting EffortSouthern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast)\n\nRussian and Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations near Svatove on January 7. The Ukrainian General Staff stated that Russian troops northwest of Svatove in the Kupyansk direction are trying to improve their tactical positions and that Ukrainian troops repelled an attack near Stelmakhivka (15km northwest of Svatove).[18] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Ukrainian troops attempted to counterattack towards Synkivka (45km northwest of Svatove).[19] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian troops attempted to advance on Stelmakhkivka and Novoselivske (13km northwest of Svatove).[20] The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported that a Russian engineering and sapper unit arrived in Svatove to examine options for potentially blowing the dam of a nearby reservoir in order to slow Ukrainian advances in the Svatove area.[21] Footage posted by Russian media outlet RIA Novosti shows a BMPT armored fighting vehicle in the Svatove area manned by personnel who appear to be wearing patches of the 3rd Army Corps.[22]\n\nRussian and Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations near Kreminna on January 7. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian troops attempted to attack near Makiivka (22km northwest of Kreminna), Dibrova (5km southwest of Kreminna), and Bilohorivka (10km south of Kreminna).[23] A Russian milblogger noted that Russian forces are attacking towards Makiivka and that Makiivka and the surrounding area are a \"grey zone.\"[24] The Russian MoD reported Ukrainian assault groups are operating in the Serebrianka forest area southwest of Kreminna.[25]\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nRussian forces made marginal confirmed advances in Soledar, but Ukrainian forces maintain control of the settlement as of January 7. Geolocated footage shows a Wagner Group fighter at the Artyomsol Plant in central Soledar.[26] Russian milbloggers also broadly claimed that Wagner Group forces are fighting around Soledar on the streets in Pidhorodne, Krasna Hora, Krasnopillia, Blahodatne, Razdolivka, and Vesele and that Wagner Group fighters have taken complete control of Pidhorodne.[27] ISW has not observed visual confirmation to corroborate these extensive claims, beyond footage of the aftermath of urban combat and fighting in residential buildings in Soledar over the course of January 6 and 7.[28] A Ukrainian military correspondent posted a geolocated picture of himself in front of the Soledar Salt Mine in northwestern Soledar, indicating that Ukrainian troops hold the northwestern part of the settlement and repelled reported Russian attacks on this part of the mine.[29] Spokesperson for the Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces, Serhiy Cherevaty, denied Russian claims that Ukrainian troops are withdrawing from Soledar, and the Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops continue to repel Russian attacks on the settlement.[30]\n\nRussian forces additionally continued ground attacks south of Bakhmut on January 7. Geolocated footage confirms that Wagner Group forces advanced into Klishchiivka (6km southwest of Bakhmut).[31] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks south of Bakhmut near Ozerianivka and Klishchiivka.[32] Russian milbloggers additionally discussed fighting south of Bakhmut near Opytne.[33] Graphic drone footage posted on January 7 shows the corpses of Wagner Group forces scattered near Bakhmut, indicating that combat in this area continues to be highly attritional.[34]\n\nRussian forces continued ground attacks along the western outskirts of Donetsk City on January 7. The Ukrainian General Staff stated that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks near Pervomaiske on the northwestern outskirts of Donetsk City, and near Marinka and Pobieda on the southwestern outskirts.[35] A Russian milblogger reported that Russian troops are attempting to bypass Avdiivka (north of Donetsk City) from positions to the north, and that the next decisive offensive action in this sector will be on Pervomaiske.[36] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Ukrainian troops conducted unsuccessful assaults northwest of Donetsk City towards Krasnohorivka and Heorhiivka.[37] Social media footage shows Russian offensive operations within Marinka, where a milblogger claimed that Russian troops are trying to bypass Ukrainian fortifications from the south.[38] Russian forces did not conduct any confirmed or claimed ground attacks in western Donetsk Oblast and continued routine fire along the line of contact in western Donetsk and eastern Zaporizhia oblasts.[39]\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nRussian forces continued routine indirect fire west of Hulyaipole and along the west (right) bank of the Dnipro River in Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson oblasts on January 7 despite the declared Russian ceasefire.[40] Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces struck Kherson City and Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.[41] Ukrainian Mayor of Kamianske, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Andriy Bilousov, reported that Ukrainian air defense shot down a Russian drone near the settlement.[42] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) likely tried to preempt criticism that Russian indirect fire continued during the period of the Russian ceasefire by claiming that Russian forces returned fire in Zaporizhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kherson oblasts to suppress Ukrainian artillery strikes against Russian positions in southern Ukraine.[43]\n\nRussian forces continue efforts to establish further control over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) as of January 7. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian occupation troops have forced about 3,000 employees at the ZNPP to obtain Russian passports.[44] Russian authorities likely forced many Ukrainian employees at the ZNPP to obtain Russian passports in order to support ongoing efforts to force the employees to sign employment contracts with Russian state nuclear power company Rosatom.[45] Energoatom reported that only 100 out of the 6700 remaining Ukrainian workers at the plant have signed contracts with Rosatom as of October 28, 2022.[46]\n\nRussian sources claimed that Russian air defenses shot down a Ukrainian drone in the vicinity of Russian-occupied Sevastopol, Crimea on the night of January 6 to 7.[47]\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nUkrainian and European officials continue to warn that Russia is preparing for an imminent second wave of mobilization. Head of the Estonian Defense Forces intelligence center Colonel Margo Grosberg stated that Russian authorities are preparing for an imminent second wave of mobilization while continuing covert mobilization and noted that details regarding this new wave will likely become clear following Orthodox Christmas.[48] Grosberg noted that a printer in Krasnodar Krai has already received an order for 5,000 mobilization call-up slips.[49] Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) representative Andriy Chernak reported on January 7 that Russian officials plan to mobilize up to 500,000 Russians, including residents of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, which arguably have faced lighter mobilization pushes in the past.[50] Ukrainian and Russian sources continue to detail ongoing Russian mobilization efforts in Russia and occupied parts of Ukraine and refusals of Russian officials to release soldiers with expired contracts.[51] One Russian source accused \"provocateurs\" of spreading false reports of mobilization to push a false narrative of the existence of a second wave.[52] However, as Ukrainian and other officials have noted, and as ISW has previously reported, discussion of a \"second\" wave of mobilization is somewhat misleading because mobilization efforts never truly ceased after the purported \"end\" of partial mobilization.[53] Even the initial partial mobilization efforts in Russia were not truly the first mobilization wave; moreover, they were the first mobilization efforts aimed at the reserve on the tail end of regionally-based volunteer recruitment drives throughout the summer of 2022. The volunteer recruitment drives, finally, followed the call-up of Russian reservists in advance of the invasion of February 24, 2022. Each successive reserve call-up reaches deeper into the pool of men who have been out of service longer, are older, in worse health, or were exempted in previous waves.\n\nRussian authorities continue to recruit for territorial defense forces and perpetuate the unrealistic threat of a Ukrainian ground assault on Russian border regions. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 7 that Russian police in Belgorod Oblast are implementing a recruitment campaign following the failure of the initial plan to generate volunteers.[54] Russian servicemen reportedly visit residential areas, survey the male population of military age, and engage in discussions aimed at popularizing service.[55]\n\nA Russian news outlet reported on January 6 that Russian authorities want to conduct \"revenue mobilization\" and collect a one-time payment of an unspecified amount from large businesses in order to fund the war and address problems in the state budget.[56] The source also claimed that Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin provided Russian officials in mid-December with relevant instructions for \"revenue mobilization\" and a proposal to allocate 175 billion rubles (about $2.4 million) to fund the war and additionally to provide for the resettlement of residents of Kherson Oblast to unspecified locations.[57] Russia continues to seek methods to circumvent growing financial difficulties, as ISW has previously reported.[58]\n\nRussian military leadership continues to experience challenges with maintaining the morale of mobilized servicemen. A Russian mobilization Telegram channel posted video footage on January 7 in which previously mobilized servicemen of Belgorod Oblast asked to go home after stating that Russian leadership sent them to the territory of the Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) as cannon fodder.[59] A Russian source claimed on January 8 that mobilized servicemen of the 568th Howitzer Artillery Battalion, now subordinate to the DNRs 1st Army corps, complained that their command is transferring them into an infantry role for which they were not trained.[60] Independent Georgia-based investigative organization Conflict Intelligence Team reported on January 6 that several mobilized Russian servicemen training in Belarus escaped from their unit and stated that the servicemen are on a wanted list in Minsk Oblast.[61]\n\nRussian military leadership continues to face resistance in ethnic enclaves following past partial mobilization efforts. The \"Free Yakutia Foundation,\" established on August 24, operates similarly to the other ethnic advocacy groups in Russia with anti-war and anti-xenophobia sentiments and seeks independence from Russia.[62] The \"Free Yakutia Foundation\" states that Russias partial mobilization scheme is part of a larger effort to ethnically cleanse indigenous peoples from Russia and that Russian military leadership intentionally sends minority groups of Russia into Ukraine as cannon fodder.[63] A Russian source claimed on January 7 that the \"Free Yakutia Foundations\" emphasis on the Russian government as a totalitarian and oppressive institution is overstated and unpopular in Russias Yakutia (Sakha) Republic and that the West is fixated on dividing the Russian Federation along ethnic lines.[64] ISW has previously reported that ethnic minority enclaves largely face the brunt of force generation efforts, which may prove to be a source of domestic dissent for the Kremlin as the war continues.[65]\n\nSome Russians continue to challenge Russian force-generation efforts. A Russian news outlet reported on January 6 that Russian authorities in Rostov-on-Don, Rostov Oblast detained three people, including two minors, on suspicion of intent to set fire to a military recruiting office using Molotov cocktails.[66]\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nRussian occupation authorities are continuing to transport Ukrainian children to Russian territory under the guise of medical rehabilitation schemes. Luhansk Oblast Administration Head Serhiy Haidai stated on January 7 that Russian occupation authorities transported 300 Ukrainian children to Moscow Oblast hospitals after Russian field doctors in Luhansk Oblast conducted medical exams to identify children with \"serious injuries.\"[67] Haidai also reported on January 7 that teachers in occupied Luhansk Oblast accept bribes from Russian occupation officials to provide authorities with lists of children for medical examinations.[68]\n\nRussian forces and occupation authorities are continuing to take measures to control movement in occupied territories. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on January 7 that Russian forces are collecting data on local residents after Russian occupation authorities introduced special permits allowing civilian movement between settlements in occupied Zaporizhia Oblast.[69] The Ukrainian Resistance Center also reported on January 7 that residents must specify the purpose of their movement and identify the person they are visiting, allowing Russian forces to gather data on connections between residents in occupied Zaporizhia Oblast.[70]\n\nRussian forces and occupation authorities are continuing to use intimidation to consolidate economic and administrative control of occupied territories. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 7 that Russian occupation authorities fully eradicated the Ukrainian hryvnia from circulation in occupied Enerhodar, Zaporizhia Oblast, by threatening local entrepreneurs with fines and confiscation of property.[71] The Ukrainian General Staff stated on January 7 that Russian forces have increased seizures of residential property in Enerhodar as the number of houses abandoned due to forced evacuation has increased.\n\nRussian occupation authorities are continuing to intensify measures to consolidate social control of occupied territories. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 7 that Russian occupation authorities replaced all Ukrainian television channels with Russian programming in Melitopol and Pryazovske, Zaporizhia Oblast.[72]\n\nRussian occupation authorities continued intensifying efforts to identify partisan activity in occupied territories on January 7. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on January 7 that Russian occupation authorities created a Telegram chatbot to encourage local residents to report on and identify Ukrainian partisans operating in Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast.[73]\n\nISW will continue to report daily observed indicators consistent with the current assessed most dangerous course of action (MDCOA): a renewed invasion of northern Ukraine possibly aimed at Kyiv.\n\nISWs December 15 MDCOA warning forecast about a potential Russian offensive against northern Ukraine in winter 2023 remains a worst-case scenario within the forecast cone. ISW currently assesses the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine from Belarus as low, but possible, and the risk of Belarusian direct involvement as very low. This new section in the daily update is not in itself a forecast or assessment. It lays out the daily observed indicators we are using to refine our assessments and forecasts, which we expect to update regularly. Our assessment that the MDCOA remains unlikely has not changed. We will update this header if the assessment changes.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this report incorrectly identified Lieutenant-General Oleksandr Pavliuk by his previous position as the Kyiv Oblast Military Administration Head. He is currently the Commander of the Kyiv Defense Forces.\n\nObserved indicators for the MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nNothing significant to report.\n\nObserved ambiguous indicators for MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nNothing significant to report.\n\nObserved counter-indicators for the MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nCommander of the Kyiv Defense Forces Lieutenant-General Oleksandr Pavliuk stated on January 7 that there is currently no immediate threat of a Russian offensive on Kyiv from Belarusian territory.[74] Pavliuk claimed that Russian forces are deployed near the Ukrainian-Belarusian border to pin Ukrainian forces on the northern border so that Ukrainian command cannot transfer these forces to eastern Ukraine.[75] Pavliuk stated that Ukrainian forces are considering the possibility of a Russian offensive in northwestern Ukraine in the coming months but have not observed Russian forces transfer the appropriate number of forces and means to Belarus in preparation for such an offensive.[76]\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff reiterated that it has not observed Russian forces in Belarus forming a strike group as of January 7.[77]\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

                "cc_text": "Russia claimed Friday to have completed its capture of the town Soledar in eastern Ukraine Friday after months of fighting in a brutal offensive that would hand the Kremlin its first significant battlefield gain since July after a wave of military setbacks.\n\nUkraine insists that the fighting was far from over. Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar described the phase of the war as being \"difficult,\" but the conflict in Soledar is \"hot,\" she wrote Friday on Telegram. \"The enemy threw almost all the main forces in the direction of Donetsk and has maintained a high intensity of the offensive,\" she said. \"Our fighters are bravely trying to hold the defense.\"\n\nThe battle for Soledar, a small salt-mining town, has emerged as a critical step in Moscows goal of encircling the key city of Bakhmut, a transportation hub under assault since August, and ultimately capturing the entire Donbas region. The fighting has intensified in recent weeks as the one-year anniversary of Russias unprovoked Feb. 24 invasion approaches, with Russia pummeling Soledad at the expense of steep losses to its own forces.\n\nAmid competing claims over control of the city, images geolocated by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based military research group, show Russian forces likely hold most, if not all, of Soledar, while pushing Ukrainian forces to the west.\n\nRead More: Ukraine Dismisses Russias Declaration of a Holiday Ceasefire\n\nOfficials from both sides have referred to the battle as a \"meat grinder,\" with streets strewn with corpses of soldiers. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week there was \"almost no life\" in Soledar and \"no whole walls left\" on any building in the mining town. \"This is what madness looks like,\" he said in a nightly video address on Monday.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Friday on its Telegram channel that the private military company Wagner Group was responsible for leading the \"direct assault.\" It was a rare nod to Wagner, which is financed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian oligarch sometimes called \"Putins Chef\" because he rose to power after running a catering company favored by the Kremlin. \"Putins shadow army\" is estimated to have thousands of members, including former convicts, and has acted as a mercenary force fighting on behalf of Russia in a way that allows Moscow a measure of deniability. The Wagner Group first appeared in 2014 during Russias annexation of Crimea.\n\nCapturing Soledar would be critical for Russias war aims but also Prigozhin, who has repeatedly criticized Russias Defense Ministry and its management of the Ukraine war. His group has deployed to other hot spots around the world, including Libya, Sudan, the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Mozambique, Mali, and Syria (where Wagner mercenaries fought a bloody battle with U.S. special forces in 2018). But achieving victory in Soledar will be a personal victory for Prigozhin, who feels his forces deserve more credit. He may also aspire to take control of the towns salt and gypsum mines for personal enrichment.\n\nRead More: Biden Deepens Involvement in War by Inviting Ukrainian Troops to U.S. for Weapons Training\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said \"theres a bit of an economic incentive\" for Russia to take Soledar, but any victory would be more symbolic than substantive. \"Even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, its not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself,\" Kirby told reporters Thursday at the White House. \"And it certainly isnt going to stop the Ukrainians or slow them down.\"\n\nKirby described the greater Donbas region as an open region of farmland akin to Kansas. Its crucial, he said, that the U.S. continues to provide \"the kinds of capabilities to Ukraine to be able to succeed in that environment.\" The Bradley Fighting Vehicles, which were part of the $2.85 billion military aid package announced last week, will be vital to safely transport troops around the battlefield during this grinding phase.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and committed to continuing economic and security support for Kyiv. \"The Secretary emphasized the United States enduring and unflinching support for Ukraine, as underscored by recent provisions of advanced air defense equipment and armored vehicles from U.S. stocks,\" according to the readout.\n\nBlinken told Kuleba that U.S. assistance would continue to flow \"in the run-up to, and beyond\" the first anniversary of Russias invasion. As the battle for Soledar shows, the end of the war remains nowhere in sight.\n\nWrite to W.J. Hennigan at william.hennigan@time.com.",

It's expected that \"all the airfields and training areas\" of Belarus' air force will be used during the tactical exercise.\n\nThe latest report on joint military exercises by allies Belarus and Russia (which have an economic and defense alliance called the \"Union State\") comes days after BelTa reported another statement from the defense ministry that stated that \"the buildup of the regional military force of Belarus and Russia continues for the sake of ensuring the military security of the Union State of Belarus and Russia.\"\n\nThe buildup of the joint regional military force involves Russian \"personnel, weapons, military and special hardware\" continuing to arrive in Belarus.\n\n\"The arriving army units are supposed to go through combat shakedown events in Belarusian military exercise areas later on,\" BelTA reported last Friday.\n\nBelarus' President Alexander Lukashenko has repeatedly stressed that the country will not enter the Ukraine war as an active participant, although Minsk has allowed Russia to launch attacks on Ukraine from its territory and has provided logistical support to its neighbor. Joint military exercises with Russia, plus the formation of a joint military unit between the countries, have only deepened suspicions that Belarus could look to support on the battlefield Russia as the war drags on.\n\nBelTA cited the country's defense ministry as stating that \"the decision to create the Belarusian-Russian regional military force in Belarus' territory had been made, and is being realized, purely for the sake of enhancing the security and defense of the Union State of Belarus and Russia depending on the evolving situation along the border.\"\n\nHolly Ellyatt",

Everything is being done to evacuate them. It is difficult to talk about the numbers now. There is a part of people, especially the older generation, who have a great fear of change, of leaving their homes and to move somewhere.

But it does not suggest a significant capitulation of Ukrainian forces, nor a substantial change to the overall complexion of the war.\n\nUkraines armed forces have denied Moscows claim. Serhiy Cherevaty, a spokesman for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told Ukrainian outlet RBC-Ukraine that Russias claim of capturing Soledar is \"not true,\" adding that \"fighting is going on in the city.\"\n\nMembers of Ukraines 46th Air Assault Brigade said they were \"hanging on\" in Soledar on Friday evening. A post on the 46th Brigades Telegram channel said: \"Were hanging on. But we are being surrounded. Heavy fighting continues inside the city.\"\n\nThe post continued, \"Apparently, the orcs [Russians] were able to cut off those who were near the railway station and Mine 7 and are making efforts to consolidate the encirclement.\"\n\nA Ukrainian soldier in the vicinity of Soledar told CNN Friday he believed he and his comrades had been left to surrender.\n\n\"Its easier to leave us to surrender than to put effort into a breakthrough,\" the soldier, whom CNN is not naming for security reasons, said on the phone. \"It means more casualties.\"\n\n\"Our units are being systematically pushed to the city center [by Russian forces] and split from each other.\"\n\nThe soldier also said he expected a repeat of Russias conquest of Mariupol early in the war, when a group of soldiers held out in the citys steel works. \"The same happened in Mariupol,\" the soldier said. \"Im 100% sure it will be like this with us. We will be left here, [the Russians] will take captive whom they can. Then we might be exchanged.\"\n\nOne day prior, the same soldier told CNN that he felt his group had been \"abandoned.\"\n\n\"If there is no order to withdraw today, we will most likely not have time to leave,\" he said. \"We were told that we would be withdrawn. And now we re just abandoned.\"\n\n\"The last evacuation was three days ago,\" he said. \"The order was to hold out to the very end.\"\n\nA point of contention between Wagner and Russias Ministry of Defense\n\nTaking Soledar would signify a victory for the Wagner private military company, whose mercenaries did much of the frontline fighting. The battle for Soledar became a point of contention between Wagner and the Russian Ministry of Defense, who had publicized competing claims about their roles in the fight.\n\nTwo days after citing only regular Russian forces for the assault on Soledar, the Russian Defense Ministry on Friday also credited Wagner troops for spearheading the \"direct assault\" on the eastern Ukrainian town.\n\nThe move appeared to be an effort at detente with the oligarch who runs Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, after a rift opened up between him and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nA satellite view shows a destroyed school and buildings in south Soledar on Tuesday. Maxar Technologies/Reuters\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministrys crediting of Wagner came after the group posted a video on Telegram Thursday directly disparaging the ministrys claim that regular Russian military forces have participated in the assault on Soledar.\n\nPrior to Russian Defense Ministrys acknowledgment of Wagner in the capture, Prigozhin posted a thinly veiled retort towards the ministry, saying that while the United States is \"a serious adversary, at the moment it is not a key one\" the Russian Defense Ministry is.\n\nThe Wagner boss has rarely missed an opportunity to take a swipe at the Russian establishment.\n\nIn a series of recent videos Prigozhin was heard saying \"once we conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption, then we will conquer the Ukrainians and NATO The problem now is that the bureaucrats and those engaging in corruption wont listen to us now because for New Years they are all drinking champagne.\"\n\nIn his Friday Telegram post, Prigozhin said \"they constantly steal victory from Wagner PMC and talk about the presence of someone who is not clear, just to belittle their merits.\" This appears to be another dig at the lack of acknowledgement of the fighting Wagner units have been doing around and in Soledar.\n\nSergey Markov, a pro-Kremlin Russian military blogger, said on Telegram Friday that the public feud and semi-insults between the leadership of the Ministry of Defense and PMC Wagner\" was damaging Russia and \"must be stopped immediately.\"\n\nThe Defense Ministry statement on Friday appears to be an attempt to make peace with the oligarch.\n\n\"Offensive operations in this tactical direction, which ended with the defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the capture of the city of Soledar, were carried out by a heterogeneous grouping of Russian troops according to a single plan, which provided for the solution of a complex of combat missions,\" the statement said.\n\n\"As for the direct assault on the city blocks of Soledar occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, this combat mission was successfully solved by the courageous and selfless actions of the volunteers of the Wagner assault squads,\" it added.\n\nThis story has been updated.",

But even as Moscow boasted of a rare territorial gain, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that it was once again replacing the top commander of the war.\n\nIn the surprise shuffle, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced he was removing Gen. Sergei Surovikin, who had led President Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine for just over three months. Surovikin, who earned the nickname \"General Armageddon\" for his brutal tactics in Syria, will be replaced by Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the longtime chief of the Russian militarys General Staff.\n\nSurovikin was named Gerasimovs deputy, an operational demotion though technically not a reduction in rank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Defense Ministry statement suggested that the reshuffle was linked to an \"expansion\" of the operation as well as to \"improve the quality and effectiveness of the management of Russian forces.\" But Russia has repeatedly changed commanders as the war has failed to meet Putins objectives, beginning with the thwarted effort to take Kyiv last spring, and the humiliating defeats in the fall in the Kharkiv region in the northeast and Kherson city in the south.\n\nSome analysts quickly suggested that the move would put heavy pressure on Gerasimov to deliver successes, perhaps in renewed offensive operations in the spring.\n\nThe changes in the leadership ranks came as Russia claimed to have seized control of Soledar in the Donetsk region. If confirmed, it would be its first significant territorial advance after months of defeats and retreats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine denied Russias claims, though its troops in the area have been under severe pressure in recent days.\n\nYevgeniy Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, claimed Russian victory in Soledar. Wagner has been leading a bloody campaign to take Soledar and neighboring Bakhmut, hoping to shift the battlefield narrative.\n\nIn audio messages published to his Telegram channel late Tuesday night, Prigozhin said his forces had captured Soledar. \"Wagner units have taken the whole territory of Soledar under control,\" he said. \"There are street battles ongoing. The number of prisoners taken will be announced tomorrow.\"\n\nPrigozhin also released a photograph that appeared to show him surrounded by Wagner forces in what the mercenary group claimed to be one of Soledars salt mines, which Ukrainian and Russian troops have been battling over for weeks. The Washington Post could not independently verify the photograph.\n\nKyiv denied Prigozhins claims, saying that Russia was still \"trying\" to take the town. A grinding, months-long artillery offensive has nearly obliterated Soledar and Bakhmut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSerhiy Cherevaty, a spokesman for Ukraines Eastern Military Command, denied Wednesday that Soledar was under Russian control. \"It is not true. Wait for details in the [upcoming] General Staff report,\" Cherevaty told Ukrainian TV.\n\nUkraines deputy defense minister, Hanna Malyar, also wrote on Telegram that the Russian attempt to capture the city had failed and that fighting was continuing.\n\n\"After suffering losses, the enemy once again carried out replacement of its units, increased the number of Wagnerites, tried to break through the defense of our troops and fully capture the city, but was unsuccessful,\" Malyar wrote.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said Soledar had been \"blocked from the north and south by Airborne Forces units.\"\n\n\"The Russian Air Force is striking enemy strongholds, and assault units are fighting in the city,\" Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian proxy officials in eastern Ukraine also claimed that Soledar had been captured.\n\nDetail Kyiv Russian-controlled area UKRAINE RUSSIA KHARKIV 20 MILES Russian-held areas Kupyansk LUHANSK Ukrainian-held areas Svatove Starobilsk Donets R.

Capturing Bakhmut would be a territorial advance for Russia toward other key Ukrainian cities in the Donetsk region, but experts have said it would be difficult for the Russian troops to push onward.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the battered and deserted city of Bakhmut last month and on Monday praised the \"heroic\" defenders of Soledar in his nightly address. \"The area near Soledar is covered with corpses of the invaders. This is what madness looks like,\" Zelensky said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with The Post on Monday, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraines National Security and Defense Council, said Russia had not \"almost captured\" the town.\n\n\"They have been capturing it for months, every day they report that they have captured it, but it is not happening,\" Danilov said. \"They are some storytellers. They are saying things that are absolutely not true.\"\n\nDuring a news briefing Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to confirm the capture of Soledar but said that there had been \"positive dynamics\" in the Russian advance and spoke repeatedly about advances in the Soledar area.\n\n\"Although tactical military successes are very important, they come at a rather high price: the price of incredible heroism of our fighters,\" Peskov said. \"Its another reason to be proud of our guys, who spare neither their lives nor their health to get these tactical successes.\"\n\nAccording to the Russian Defense Ministry, Russian forces also captured the village of Pidhorodne in the Donetsk region and had killed up to 80 Ukrainian soldiers. Those claims could not be verified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latest changes to the Russian military leadership follow growing tensions between Prigozhins Wagner faction, which has led the charge in Bakhmut, and the regular military commanders in charge of Russias war. Prigozhin had praised Surovikins promotion to overall war commander in October.\n\nOn Tuesday, Prigozhin criticized the Defense Ministry, boasting that his combat experience was \"in many ways significantly superior to those who have been in the service of the Ministry of Defense for decades.\"\n\nGerasimov, the newly appointed commander, has faced persistent and heavy criticism by Russias pro-war bloggers for Moscows humiliating losses on the battlefield given his role as chief of the General Staff.\n\nMark Galeotti, an analyst and expert on Russian security affairs, wrote that Gerasimovs appointment was also a kind of \"demotion\" and that he was \"hanging by a thread.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"For Gerasimov it is a kind of demotion, or at least the most poisoned of chalices,\" Galeotti wrote on Twitter. \"Its now on him. But he needs some kind of win or a career ends in ignominy.\" Galeotti added that the shuffle was a clear sign that fresh offensives are coming.\n\nMeanwhile, Wednesdays replacement of Surovikin, a favorite of Prigozhin, as well as the appointment of Alexander Lapin to lead Russias ground forces appeared to snub both the Wagner chief and Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, who has also openly criticized several of Russias leading military figures.\n\nSeparately Wednesday, the Ukrainian and Russian human rights commissioners met on the sidelines of a forum in Ankara, Turkey, along with that countrys rights ombudsman their first face-to-face meeting since October. Among the issues discussed were the potential creation of humanitarian corridors, a proposal to treat wounded Ukrainian soldiers in Turkey, and future prisoner exchanges.\n\n\"During the meeting very important words were exchanged about the need for a cease-fire,\" Russian human rights ombudswoman Tatyana Moskalkova wrote on her Telegram channel after the talks. \"It is a prerequisite for preventing human rights violations. First of all, the right to life.\"",

And let me say first, Secretary Austin and I just concluded a very productive and wide-ranging discussion with our colleagues Foreign Minister Hayashi, Defense Minister Hamada and this of course is ahead of President Biden hosting Prime Minister Kishida at the White House on Friday.\n\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of the U.S.-Japan Alliance. For more than seven decades, its been the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific ensuring the security, the liberty, the prosperity of our people and people across the region.\n\nOne of the Alliances enduring sources of strength is our ability to adapt it to meet the evolving challenges as well as the opportunities before us.\n\nJapans new national security strategy, national defense strategy, and defense buildup program reflect the scale and scope of that transformation.\n\nThese new strategies make clear Japans commitment to invest in enhancing its capabilities, to take on new roles, and foster even closer defense cooperation with the United States and our mutual partners. We applaud Japans pledge to double defense spending by 2027.\n\nJapans strategies align closely with our own National Security Strategy both in the key challenges we identify as well as in how to effectively address them.\n\nWere committed to upholding shared values of democracy and human rights, defending the international rule of law, continuing to lead the world in tackling global challenges that no one country can solve alone, like the climate crisis and deadly viruses.\n\nWe agree that the PRC is the greatest shared strategic challenge that we and our allies and partners face.\n\nWe stand together with Ukraine against President Putins war, which threatens the principles at the heart of the international rules-based order including that all nations should be able to chart their own path, and have their sovereignty, their independence, their territorial integrity respected.\n\nIn the face of these and other challenges, today we discussed ways to deepen our coordination, including on allied command and control, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, joint and shared usage of facilities, and increased bilateral exercises.\n\nMore than ever before, were buttressing the U.S.-Japan Alliance through deeper cooperation with other allies and partners, through both regional and multilateral bodies.\n\nIn the face of the DPRKs unlawful and reckless missile launches including the launch of a long-range ballistic missile over Japan in October were deepening our trilateral cooperation with the Republic of Korea to deter and, if necessary, defend against aggression. Thats a pledge the leaders of our three countries underscored in their November trilateral summit.\n\nToday we held our first formal dialogue in this 2+2 format on extended deterrence namely, to enhance the capability and credibility of our allied defense against a wide range of threats.\n\nIn June of 2022, Prime Minister Kishida became the first Japanese leader to attend a NATO summit. Japan is spearheading the NATO Asia Pacific partners group demonstrating the growing synergy between our Atlantic and Pacific alliances.\n\nWere working together with our G7 partners to impose coordinated sanctions on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine, and to help Ukraine repair, restore, and defend its embattled energy grid. We look forward to Japans leadership in driving an ambitious agenda on these and other priorities during its presidency of the G7 this year, culminating in the Hiroshima Summit.\n\nJapan has also stepped up to help our European friends diversify their LNG supply in response to President Putins weaponization of energy.\n\nWere working to advance peace and security through regional bodies like ASEAN, whose centrality is vital to the Indo-Pacific; and through the Quad, including by working with India and Australia to expand what we call maritime domain awareness, basically giving our partners a better ability to detect and respond to challenges in their territorial waters like illegal fishing, trafficking, climate-related disasters.\n\nAt the United Nations, were rallying member states to defend the rights at the core of the United Nations Charter. Its been less than two weeks since Japan took its non-permanent seat at the Security Council; already we see its leadership on key priorities, like peacebuilding, Afghanistan, and the ministerial that the foreign minister will chair tomorrow on the rule of law.\n\nAnd because our National Security Strategy is so bound up in our economic and energy security, were strengthening our cooperation in these spheres as well. In May we joined a dozen other economies that represent 40 percent of global GDP to launch the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which sets out a roadmap to help our economies grow faster and fairer, so that all of our people can reach their full potential.\n\nLast month we kicked off the first Japan-U.S. Energy Security Dialogue; tomorrow our governments will co-host the Fifth Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Tokyo.\n\nWere constantly expanding the horizons of our cooperation beyond even our planet. Later this week, the foreign minister and I will sign a new agreement on U.S.-Japan cooperation in space. This agreement has been a decade in the making; it covers everything from joint research to working together to land the first woman and person of color on the Moon.\n\nThe bottom line is this: We and our people are always stronger and more secure together. Today weve taken yet another step toward tightening already incredibly strong bonds.\n\nWith that, Yogi, the floor is yours.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI: (Via interpreter) Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, Minister Hamada, and I have just come out of the Japan-U.S. 2+2 meeting, which we had in person, where we engaged in extremely meaningful exchange of views. During the past year since the previous 2+2 meeting, Russias aggression of Ukraine, an event that shakes the foundation of international order, occurred, placing the international community at historical crossroads. In the midst of elevated severity in the security environment, todays Japan-U.S. 2+2 took place at a timing shortly after the release of strategic documents by both countries.\n\nTodays meeting delivered three major outcomes, and let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, based on the strategic documents of our two countries, we were able to hold in-depth discussions to confirm the alignment of the recognition on both sides over the regional strategic environment thoroughly and in detail. Specifically, first of all on China, China presents an unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge. Its foreign policy to recreate international order to serve its self-interest is a grave concern for the Japan-U.S. Alliance and for the whole of the international community.\n\nUpon confirming such shared recognition, we confirmed that Japan and the U.S. will continue to be united in raising objections against Chinas attempts to change status quo in the East China Sea, including its behavior that seeks to undermine long years of administration by Japan of the Senkaku Islands.\n\nWe also confirmed our strong opposition against unlawful claims and coercive and provocative efforts and actions by China in the South China Sea. We reaffirmed that the basic positions of our two countries over Taiwan remains unchanged, and confirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability of the Taiwan Straits, which is an essential element for the safety and prosperity of the international community. At the same time, we concurred that there have not been any changes to our policies to strengthen communication with China, including in the area of security.\n\nOn Russia, we reaffirmed our notion that aggression of Ukraine shakes the foundation of international order; accused Russia for its reckless nuclear rhetoric and attacks against civilian infrastructure; and concurred to continue our strong support to Ukraine. In addition, we shared our concern over the enhanced military cooperation between China and Russia.\n\nFurther, on North Korea, we strongly accused them for the launch of ballistic missiles during the past year at unprecedented frequency, and reaffirmed our unwavering commitment towards the complete denuclearization of North Korea based on UN Security Council resolutions.\n\nWith our positions perfectly aligned, we agreed to continue to work closely together in responding to the North Korea issue, including the pursuit of immediate resolution of the abduction issue. And we agreed about deepening the trilateral cooperation between the three countries.\n\nSecondly, we affirmed the further endeavors to bolster the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance in view of the new strategies based on the increasingly severe security environment. I welcomed the U.S. resolve to optimize the force posture in the Indo-Pacific, including Japan, and we decided to continue close consultation how to further optimize the U.S. force posture in Japan, including the readjustment of the USFJ realignment announced this time.\n\nExtended deterrence was one of the agenda, and there was in-depth discussions at the ministerial level. Spending some time having discussed that, we reaffirmed the strong U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan, underpinned by the full range of U.S. capabilities, including nuclear. Furthermore, there was an affirmation of strong support by the U.S. on the new security policy of Japan in that it will fundamentally reinforce the deterrence capability of the Alliance.\n\nIn addition, we agreed on the importance of deepening our cooperation in the areas of space and cyber, the promotion of technological cooperation, the further strengthening of information security. The fact that we were able to agree on the announcement of the applicability of Article V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty on attacks on others in outer space was a significant achievement in terms of the reinforcement of deterrence capability of the Alliance as a whole.\n\nThirdly, we once again affirmed the importance of the reduction of the impact on the local communities, including Okinawa. We also reaffirmed that in order to avoid the continued use of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, the relocation to Henoko is the only solution.\n\nFurthermore, I once again requested the U.S. side on safe operations with utmost consideration to the impact on the local communities; appropriate responses to incidents and accidents, including sharing information in a timely manner; and on environmental issues, and confirmed our close coordination.\n\nThe joint announcement the joint statement issued as a result of this 2+2 is a presentation of the vision of a modernized Alliance (inaudible) posture to win in the new era of strategic competition. The vision will be executed speedily, and together with Minister Hamada, Secretary Blinken, and Secretary Austin, we will constantly bolster the Japan-U.S. Alliance. Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY AUSTIN: Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks to everyone for being here. At the outset, let me thank my friend and colleague, Secretary Blinken, for hosting todays U.S.-Japan 2+2 Ministerial Meeting. Thanks, Tony.\n\nMinister Hamada, Minister Hayashi, I want to underscore my support for the bold decisions that Japan has made in your 2022 national security strategy, your national defense strategy, and your defense buildup program. There is clear strategic alignment between the visions of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida. It is a shared commitment to uphold the rules-based international order and to strengthen resilient partnerships around the globe. And the essential U.S.-Japan Alliance is at the center of these efforts. Our respective defense strategies provide a strong foundation for our ongoing work to modernize the U.S.-Japan Alliance. In addition, Japans commitments to substantially increase its defense spending and to invest in defense institutions and infrastructure and capabilities will accelerate our Alliances efforts. Im grateful that were meeting at such a consequential time, as Japan strengthens its own defense and further contributes to regional peace and stability.\n\nToday we welcomed an historic Alliance decision to optimize U.S. force posture in Japan by forward stationing more versatile, mobile, and resilient capabilities. These actions will bolster deterrence in the region and allow us to defend Japan and its people more effectively. In an increase in an increasingly challenging security environment, weve decided that the 12th Artillery Regiment would remain in Japan and be reorganized into the 12th Marine Littoral Regiment by 2025. We will equip this new formation with advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as anti-ship and transportation capabilities that are relevant to the current and future threat environments. These posture updates adhere to the basic tenets of the 2012 realignment plan, and they will strengthen our Alliances ability to maintain regional peace and stability.\n\nWe also discussed updating our Alliances roles and missions so that Japan can more actively contribute to regional security alongside the United States and other likeminded partners. And so in our meeting today we strongly endorsed Japans decision to acquire a counterstrike capability, and we affirmed that close coordination on employing this capability will strengthen the U.S.-Japan Alliance. We also discussed a number of key issues including our shared interest in peace and stability in the East and South China Seas and around Taiwan and our commitment to to the denuclearization of North Korea, and our efforts to increase multilateral cooperation with the Republic of Korea, Australia, and other likeminded partners and our growing cooperation across all domains, including space and cyber.\n\nNow, as youve heard me say before, the Peoples Republic of China is a pacing challenge for the Department of Defense. Japan and the United States remain united in our concern over Chinas destabilizing actions, and I want to reaffirm the United States ironclad commitment to defend Japan with the full range of capabilities, including nuclear, and underscore that Article V of the mutual security treaty applies to the Senkaku Islands. And tomorrow Minister Hamada and I will sign new arrangements that will increase opportunities for the Japanese and the United States defense enterprises to closely cooperate on advanced technologies as well as increased linkages between our respective industrial bases. And our close consultations today have advanced our Alliances efforts to address common challenges ahead of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishidas meeting at the White House this week.\n\nIll close by reiterating that the U.S.-Japan Alliance remains a cornerstone of our Indo-Pacific strategy, and its critical to upholding a free and open regional order. Our Alliance is stronger than ever, building on a foundation of teamwork, trust, and shared values that has underpinned our relationship for decades. And so there is no challenge that we can overcome if we continue to work shoulder to shoulder. Thank you.\n\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA: (Via interpreter) At the outset, I extend my deepest appreciation to Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, and members of the U.S. side for having organized this meeting. My three colleagues have already mentioned the severity of the security environment surrounding us. As we live in this age of intense competition, in order to sustain a new rules-based international order and free and open Indo-Pacific, the role that the Japan-U.S. Alliance must play has never been so enormous. The national security and defense strategies of our two countries that have been prepared most recently are highly consistent at a degree never seen before and will serve as a strong infrastructure for our bilateral cooperation.\n\nWhat is noteworthy is the importance attached to the attached by both countries to integrate all means and approaches to deter a situation from occurring. Alignment of our positions as such has been significant. At the same time, strategies dont end by just preparing them. In light of the severity of the security environment, both Japan and the U.S. is expected to put their strategies into action swiftly and steadily.\n\nBased on the new strategy, in order to expeditiously achieve the fundamental reinforcement of Japans defense capabilities, I am committed to making maximum efforts to gain new capabilities, including counterstrike capability and to enhanced persistent warfare capability. I am much encouraged by the strong support shown by Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken as I shared with them such resolve. Japan and the U.S. must properly engage in discussions on strengthening partnership.\n\nDuring todays consultations, we agreed on the need to realize division of roles and missions assuming the fundamental reinforcement of Japans defense capabilities. The four of us agreed to promote initiatives in extensive areas, including effective operation of counterstrike capability based on bilateral cooperation, strengthening collaboration in space and cyber, and deepening cooperation in equipment and technology.\n\nWe also agreed to deepen cooperation with partners, including Australia, ROK, ASEAN, and Europe, to expand partnership and based on our Alliance, because in the increasingly important extended deterrence in the region, I have listened to the extensive viewpoints of the U.S. from Secretary Austin. Based on that, in order for the U.S. extended deterrence to be even more reliable and resilient, we discussed what the two countries need to do in order to optimize the U.S. force posture in Japan. The current realignment plan was coordinated in 2012, but in order to deal with the increasingly severe security environment, both Japan and the U.S. have decided to readjust the plan while maintaining the fundamental principles.\n\nKeeping the 3rd Marines Division command and the 12th Marines Littoral Regiment in Okinawa will allow the forward-deployed U.S. force posture to have more versatile capabilities, be more resilient and more mobile. This effort will significantly strengthen the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and at the same time it will demonstrate the robust commitment of the U.S. to the defense of Japan. In order to execute these plans, we will coordinate closely with the U.S. side.\n\nI also mentioned that for the stable stationing and activities of USFJ, the understanding by the local community such as Okinawa is crucial. We will continue to work on the reduction of impact on Okinawa. It was extremely significant that, at a timing so soon after the two countries had formulated the strategic documents that will guide the future national security and defense policies, that the four ministers responsible for defense and foreign policy got together and had the opportunity to engage in in-depth discussions on how to implement their respective strategy. I shall continue the discussions in order to bolster our Alliance. Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Well now turn to questions. We will alternate questions per side. We will start with Shaun Tandon of the AFP.\n\nQUESTION: Hi there. Good evening. Thanks for this. Can I follow up on a couple of things that you just announced? Speaking about the Marine littoral regiment, both of the defense both the Defense Secretary and defense minister spoke of the increasing the increasingly challenging security environment. Can you be more specific in what youre responding to? Is this specifically China? Is these are these contingencies in Taiwan or potentially in the Senkaku Islands, North Korea? And also you mentioned the impact in Okinawa. Is there any concern that this could aggravate tensions locally in Okinawa? Will this result in a net increase in the forces there? And if you dont mind, could I also ask about space? There have been some reports that space will now be included as part of the defense partnership. Could you comment on that?\n\nAnd for on the American side, if you dont mind if you dont mind a couple of questions that are a little bit off topic. To Secretary Austin, the situation in Ukraine Soledar. There have been lots of reports the Wagner Group has claimed to control it, and theres been another shake-up in the Russian military command. What do you make of this? Do you think that its fallen? What significance do you see?\n\nAnd Secretary Blinken, a couple of days ago you were just in Latin America yesterday, but a couple of days ago in Brazil there was, of course, the unrest. Former President Bolsonaro remains in the United States. There have been some calls from the Democratic Party to make a persona non grata. How tenable is it to for him to stay in Florida despite what happened a couple of days ago in Brasilia? Thanks very much.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: You want to start?\n\nSECRETARY AUSTIN: So I lost count I lost count on a number of questions, but well try to knock them down. If we miss one, then well double back.\n\nFirst, let me begin with the question you asked on Soledar and whether or not its fallen to the Russians. At this point, we cant corroborate that reporting. Of course, Ive seen some of that reporting, but you know that this has been a very fluid, dynamic environment, dynamic fight in that area. Its gone back and forth a number of times, and it really is some pretty brutal fighting. But the Ukrainians have acquitted themselves very, very in a very impressive fashion as a theyve fought a very continue to fight a very determined fight.\n\nWe are focused on doing everything we can to help make sure that the Ukrainians have the capabilities that they need to be successful in their efforts to defend their sovereign territory. Weve been we talk I talk to my counterpart routinely. Were going to conduct another Ukraine Contact Group Defense Contact Group meeting next week in Germany, where well get another well get 50 or so ministers of defense together to talk about what Ukraines needs are now and what they need to be successful going forward.\n\nSo youve heard us say over and over again that were going to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, and from everything that I can see from our allies and partners, they feel the same way. So we remain united in our efforts.\n\nOn the Marine littoral regiment, we believe that this brings this capability brings a tremendous capability to the Alliance. Were replacing an artillery regiment with an outfit thats more lethal, more agile, more capable. And as you have seen from whats been published on this particular formation, it consists of a combat element, which is a battalion-size element; a long-range fires element, which allows us to gives us an anti-ship capability, which I think is very, very important; and also a logistical element that helps sustain the overall regiment there.\n\nSo I think this is going to contribute in a major way in our efforts to help defend Japan, and also promote a free and open Indo-Pacific. And thats really our focus. Japan we share a common vision with Japan to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, and all the things that were doing points towards that direction.\n\nSo Im going to stop there and allow Minister Hamada to comment, if youd like.\n\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA: (Via interpreter) Regarding the current topic, our position is, in Okinawa, that there are realignment in many other comments referred to. With regard to these aspects, we understand and together with the U.S. forces, including the coordination, our discussion will have to take place. But at any rate, regarding the matters in Okinawa, that there is the relationship with the local communities, and we will have to continue our effort to explain in order to overcome these challenges. Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Shaun, just to respond, I think, to a couple of other questions you asked. First, in terms of the security environment that were dealing with, theres I think its no secret that it is a more challenging one, and we see different challenges to the status quo coming from different countries including China, including the DPRK, including of course Russia. Even though that aggression against Ukraine is happening in Europe, it has profound implications for countries around the world, including in Asia because this is not only a challenge to Ukraine and the lives and livelihoods of its people, its a challenge to the entire international rules-based order and the very principles that underlie that order that are so important in every part of the world: sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, the right to shape your own future. Thats why Japan, from day one, has been such a strong partner with us and many other countries in seeking to uphold that order, whether it comes to Russias aggression or in any other areas.\n\nYou asked about our cooperation in space. Well, theres cooperation in cyberspace and theres cooperation in outer space. Well be putting out a statement, if its not already out, that reflects the additional steps that weve taken. But this is very significant. Were working to deepen our cooperation across every realm land, sea, air, and yes, space, cyber and outer.\n\nThe outer space component of this is important to the security and prosperity of our Alliance. We agreed, as youve heard, that attacks to, from, or within space present a clear challenge, and we affirmed that depending on the nature of those attacks, this could lead to the invocation of Article V of our Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. That is significant. Well sign, as I mentioned, a space agreement a little bit later this week at NASA.\n\nOn cyber, we have emphasized the foundational importance of cyber security and information security for our Alliance. We agreed there as well to deepen our collaboration. This is a challenge that we both face, other countries face; its important that we work on it together. Were all learning lessons in dealing with the challenges that come in cyberspace. Being able to share best practices, being able to support one another, is more important than ever.\n\nWere also committed in that light to bolstering technology cooperation as well as making joint investments in emerging technologies to try to further sharpen the competitive edge of the Alliance.\n\nLast question, as I heard it, with regard to Brazil. As President Biden told President Lula, we stand with the people of Brazil. We stand with Brazils democracy and its institutions. The President will have an opportunity to confer directly and closely with President Lula when he visits Washington in early February, and the President looks very much forward to that.\n\nPresident Lula has called for an investigation of the events of January 8th. Im not going to get ahead of that. Weve not received any specific requests from Brazilian authorities. Of course, if and when we do, well work expeditiously to respond, as we always do.\n\nAnd then with regard to individuals, were talking now about people who are private citizens. Weve heard various public statements that have been made by those individuals about their plans, but we really dont have anything to add, and its not appropriate for us to comment on any individuals visa status.\n\nMODERATOR: (Via interpreter) Next, from the Japanese press, Miki-san of Nikkei newspaper company.\n\nQUESTION: (Via interpreter) My name is Miki of Nihon Keizai Shimbun company. I have a question to both foreign and defense ministers of Japan and the United States. In East Asia, there are concerns of unilateral change of status quo by force, and there are those who point out the Taiwan contingency risk. Youve mentioned the southwest defense bolstering, but what agreement have you reached in the 2+2 to upgrade the response and deterrence capability? And how will you go about in terms of integrated operations between SDF and U.S. forces?\n\nAnd in the renewed national security strategies, both countries positioned China as being a challenge for the international community. How do you assess the risk in terms of security by China in East Asia, and how will you respond?\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI: (Via interpreter) First of all, on Nansei Islands, with severity of the security environment surrounding Japan increasing, in order to reinforce the defense of our nation, including the Nansei Islands, strengthening the deterrence and response capabilities of our Alliance is an urgent mission. At todays 2+2, we concurred on the decisive importance of joint initiatives at peacetime to deter armed attack against and attacks that undermine regional stability.\n\nBased on such shared recognition, the joint statement issued today refers to concrete initiatives for example, in the area including the Nansei Islands, joint use of Japan-U.S. facilities will be expanded and joint exercises and training will be increased.\n\nOn Taiwan, I refrain from responding to a hypothetical question on contingency in Taiwan. It has been the consistent policy of Japan that peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait is important not only for Japans security, but also for the stability of the international community at large, and that we hope to see Taiwan-related issues be resolved peacefully through dialogue.\n\nNow, on China, as explicitly mentioned in the new national security strategy, present external posture and military orientation of China are grave concerns for Japan and the international community. As we strive to secure peace and stability of Japan and the international community and strengthen international order based on rule of law, China presents an unprecedented and the greatest challenge. At the same time, Japan and China both bear important responsibility for regional and global peace and prosperity. Establishment of a constructive and stable relationship by Japan and China is essential for peace and stability of the international community, including the Indo-Pacific.\n\nDefense Minister?\n\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA: (Via interpreter) Yes. As mentioned by Minister Hayashi, that is our position. Based upon the mutual recognition of Japan and the United States in the area including Nansei Islands, we will expand the joint use of facilities of Japan and the United States, and weve committed to increase joint exercises and joint trainings. In such form, we will upgrade the deterrence and response capabilities of our Alliance, which is necessary, and we will continue to work in close coordination with the United States following todays meeting. Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I have little to add because my colleagues have covered it so well. Suffice to say that first, we are united in ways that, at least in my experience over the last 30 years, weve never been before. Theres greater convergence in our approach, greater alignment in our approach both in terms of the way we see the challenges and how we propose to respond to them than ever before. And I think thats very significant, and youve heard both ministers speak to it. The statements that were putting out or weve already put out this afternoon will reflect in detail that alignment, that convergence between Japan and the United States.\n\nWhen it comes to Taiwan, I think its very important to note that what weve seen from China in recent years not recent months, recent years is, unfortunately, an effort to undermine the longstanding status quo, a status quo thats maintain peace and stability for decades. We, on the other hand, want to sustain that status quo; we want to bolster it. We oppose any unilateral change to the status quo by either side. Well continue for a calm, resolute approach to uphold peace and stability. Japan in the United States are united in that effort.\n\nAs youve heard us say, our Alliance is a cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. And the steps that we announced today will strengthen the Alliances ability to uphold the rules-based order that we are both very much committed to.\n\nSECRETARY AUSTIN: I think that my colleagues have did a have done a tremendous job of outlining the key points here, and so I wont plow that ground again. But I would just say that we really do remain committed to enhancing resiliency and interoperability between U.S. and Japanese forces and deepening the operational cooperation. So the things that we touched upon today, especially the agreement to increase bilateral exercises and training, I think are a real powerful statement of that commitment. So I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on these issues going forward.\n\nMR PRICE: Our next question goes to Ryo Kiyomiya from Asahi Shimbun.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you so much. Im Ryo Kiyomiya from Asahi Shimbun, Washington, D.C. bureau. I have questions for each of you. First, Secretary Austin, while U.S. and Japan share the concern about the Chinas military aggression, how can the U.S. manage the relationship with China and avoid miscalculation leading to the contingencies? And last October you said that you dont see an imminent invasion of Taiwan by China. Do you still hold that view?\n\nAnd also, if I may, Japan decided to establish our self-defense force joint headquarter. From your perspective, what would be the ideal Alliance command and control relationship between U.S. and Japan to enhance interoperability and readiness?\n\nAnd Secretary Blinken, regarding U.S.-China relations, how do you plan to manage and build the relationship with China during your upcoming engagement with China? And also, what kind of role do you expect Japan to play in diplomacy to manage this relationship?\n\nAnd finally, to Minister Hamada and Minister Hayashi, there is a growing sense of risk about Chinas invasion of Taiwan. In the previous 2+2 meeting, U.S. and Japan welcomed the robust progress on bilateral planning for contingencies. How would you evaluate the current progress on bilateral planning for contingencies so far with the U.S.? Also, from the perspective of deterring Chinas aggression, how do you evaluate the recent U.S. announcement of reorganization of Marines in Okinawa into the Marine littoral regiment? Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY AUSTIN: Okay, thank you. I think your first question was: how do we avoid miscalculation? Youve heard me say a number of times that its absolutely critical that leaders of great powers maintain open lines of communication and be able to talk with each other. In that way, we can avoid miscalculation wherever possible. And you see us continuing to try to ensure that we keep those lines open, and I would invite my colleagues in China to meet us halfway there and work hard to keep those lines of communication open. And that is the primary and best way to avoid that miscalculation. Of course, I believe that our forces are trained and disciplined, and to the degree that theyre going to do everything within their power to avoid any kind of misunderstanding or miscalculation. But again, that dialogue is enormously important.\n\nSo and then your second question was regarding whether or not China is whether or not an invasion of Taiwan by China is imminent. I wont second-guess Mr. Xi, but what I will tell you, what were seeing recently, is some very provocative behavior on the part of Chinas forces and their attempt to re-establish a new normal. So weve seen increased activity in aerial activity in the straits. Weve seen increased surface vessel activity around Taiwan. And again, we believe that they endeavor to establish a new normal, but whether or not that means that an invasion is imminent, I seriously doubt that.\n\nSo we will continue to watch and we will continue to work with our allies and partners to do everything that we can to ensure that we promote peace and stability in the strait and in the region overall.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And just quickly to more broadly to add to that on China, as you know, President Biden, President Xi had a very open, candid conversation during the last G20 meeting in Bali, and they spoke about our intentions. President Biden shared our intentions and our priorities, and we got some sense of that from President Xi as well. As the Secretary of Defense just said, these lines of communication, starting with the presidents but also including many of us, are vitally important vitally important to keep open and, I would hope, to deepen, because, as the Secretary of Defense said, what we dont want is for any misunderstanding to veer into conflict.\n\nI will have an opportunity to travel to China in the coming weeks to follow up on the Presidents discussions precisely to move forward on those lines of communication between us. We both of our countries, Japan and the United States have complex and consequential relationships with China, and there are clearly aspects of intense competition between us. There are aspects as well of cooperation, and its important to see if we can pursue those. We hear from countries around the world the desire for the United States, China, Japan to manage this relationship responsibly and, if there are areas where we can cooperate that would be to the benefit not only of our own people but of people around the world, whether its in climate, whether its in global health, whether its in dealing with drugs, we should pursue them.\n\nBut we are going to compete vigorously. The Presidents been very clear about that. Were not looking for conflict. Well manage the competition responsibly, but we will compete vigorously. And we will seek to keep these lines of communication open and do all that we can to establish guardrails to prevent competition, as I said, from veering into conflict.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI: (Via interpreter) First of all, U.S.s commitment and optimization of the posture in the Indo-Pacific, including Japan, is very much welcome. And including the recoordination of the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan in order to optimize posture of USFJ, we decided to continue our close consultations. And this may not be a direct response to your question I may have misunderstood your question but if your question is implying on guideline, there was no discussion over U.S.-Japan guidelines. Regarding the necessity of review of the Japan-U.S. guidelines, of course, it is being constantly studied. But we dont assume that it will be immediately necessary. Thank you.\n\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA: (Via interpreter) On the U.S.-Japan bilateral planning, in 2015, based upon the guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense cooperation, the Japan-U.S. governments are to prepare and renew bilateral planning. And we very much welcomed the steadfast progress of this task. And in order to respond to the very severe security environment in Japan, by maintaining the remaining Marine Corps in Okinawa after the realignment decision was made to keep the 3rd Division of the Marine Corps and the 12th Regiment of the Marine Corps and agreed to realign into MLR by 2025, we believe that this will bolster the USFJ posture in Japan. And this also is a demonstration of the unwavering commitment of the United States towards the defense of Japan. And together with the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities of Japan, this will significantly elevate the deterrence and response capabilities of our Alliance against attacks armed attacks to Japan.\n\nMODERATOR: (Via interpreter) This will be the last question. Tajima-san, Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: (Via interpreter) Tajima, Asahi Shimbun. Thank you. During this meeting, I believe the new national security strategy and the new defense strategy were the main topics, so I asked Minister Hayashi and Minister Hamada so the reinforcement of defense, including counterstrike capability and the meaning and the goal of significant increase of defense expense, how did you explain to the U.S. side, please?\n\nAnd then, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin, if I may, the strengthening of Japans defense capability, what is your assessment? And the new strategies of both countries have been evidence coming forward the deterrence and the response capability of the two countries. How do you intend to elevate? Earlier Minister Hayashi referred to the guideline, about the possibility of the need to revise the guideline. What is your view? Thank you.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI: Please allow me to start. At the 2+2 today, the based on the new strategy, we affirmed the future activities in order to bolster the defense response capabilities of the Alliance under the new strategy in light of the increasingly severe security environment. I mentioned that the fundamental reinforcement of Japans defense capability will lead to further effective exercise of U.S. capabilities, and that in turn would mean a further reinforcement of the deterrence response capabilities of the bilateral Alliance and would play a huge role for the peace and stability of the region. The U.S. in response expressed firm support.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, as a result of the 2+2, the joint statement to be released, this presents a vision of the Alliance in the new era of strategic competition. The plans will be implemented speedily, and together with Minister Hamada, Secretary Blinken, and Secretary Austin, we will constantly bolster the bilateral Alliance.\n\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA: (Via interpreter) If I may, regarding the fundamental reinforcement of Japans defense in order to speedily realize about the significant increased defense, we will acquire new capabilities, including war sustainability and counterstrike capability, and I expressed my very strong commitment. As Minister Hayashi just mentioned, the U.S. side mentioned that they will strongly support Japans new strategy, that it is a major evolution of the bilateral Alliance.\n\nBased on todays discussion, in this most severe and complex security environment after the war, we will fundamentally reinforce the defense capability, including the counterstrike capability. And together, in order to make the U.S. Alliance be a contribution to peace, stability, and prosperity of the region and the world, we will continue to work with Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, and Minister Hayashi to strengthen the Alliance. Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you for the question. Its very simple: We heartily welcome the new strategies, especially because there is, as I said and weve all said, remarkable convergence between our strategy strategies and Japans. We applaud the commitment to increased investment; to enhanced roles, missions, and capabilities that youve heard; to closer cooperation not only between the United States and Japan, but as well with other allies and other partners on a bilateral basis but also on a trilateral and multilateral basis. We already have a strong foundation. Thats only going to grow.\n\nAs we read them, these new documents really reshape the Alliances ability to promote peace and protect the rules-based order in the region but also beyond, around the world. I think what youre seeing in real time is an Alliance that is modernizing, and the United States and Japan are working in lock step to be prepared for the emerging challenges in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.\n\nSo we could not be more pleased with the work that were doing together, but also, and I have to say for Japans extraordinary leadership, I know President Biden will have an opportunity to share that appreciation with Prime Minister Kishida when he welcomes him here to Washington later this week.\n\nSECRETARY AUSTIN: I certainly agree with Secretary Blinken. There is clear strategic alignment between the visions of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida. You see that reflected in the strategies as you put them side by side. We are all focused on maintaining a rules-based international order and promoting peace and stability in the region.\n\nSo what youve heard us talk about today the things that we discussed in the meeting really bring that strategy to life. Optimizing force posture, agreeing to increase our bilateral exercises and training events all of those things are real good indicators that all of us are committed to making sure that, as Prime Minister Hamada has said previously, we dont just write strategies, we do the things necessary to be able to execute them. And this is work thats never finished, okay, so we will continue to work to optimize force posture and increase interoperability so that we maintain a credible deterrent force. And I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to do that, what I would call hard government work. But thank you very much.\n\nMR PRICE: Thank you, Your Excellencies. Thank you, everyone. That concludes the press conference.\n\n# # #",

Moscow has been trying to seize Bakhmut for months.\n\n\"The situation in Soledar is near critical - the city is semi-encircled. Only one road is left to supply our troops,\" said Oleh Zhdanov, a military analyst based in Kyiv.\n\nZhdanov, speaking in a social media video, said Russia had brought in airborne troops as reinforcements in the battle.\n\nBut Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern military command, told Reuters by telephone that Soledar had not been captured: \"Our units are there, the town is not under Russian control.\"\n\nIn an evening video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said fighting for Soledar continued.\n\n\"The difficult battle for the Donetsk region continues. The battle for Bakhmut and Soledar, for Kreminna, for other cities and villages in the east of our country continues,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nCNN said on its website that a reporting team just outside Soledar could hear mortar and rocket fire on Friday afternoon and saw Ukrainian forces ferrying troops in what appeared to be an organised pullback.\n\n'MEAT GRINDER'\n\nA Ukrainian officer in the area also told Reuters by telephone the Russians had not fully taken the town.\n\n[1/27]Ukrainian serviceman Hryhorii, 42, of the 43rd Heavy Artillery Brigade emerges from a German howitzer Panzerhaubitze 2000, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, near Soledar, Ukraine, January 11, 2023.

From what I know, our boys have managed to exit some parts (of Soledar) in an orderly manner and now (assault) groups are counterattacking, but we still hold the town.\"\n\nUkrainian officials said on Thursday that more than 500 civilians, including 15 children, were trapped inside Soledar.\n\nAfter Ukrainian forces drove Russia into humiliating retreats for much of the second half of 2022, the front lines have barely moved for the past two months. Meanwhile, the battles around Bakhmut and Soledar became what both sides called a \"meat grinder\" - a brutal war of attrition claiming the lives of thousands of soldiers.\n\nBoth Bakhmut and Soledar are in the Donetsk region, which Russia unilaterally claimed to have annexed in September despite only partly occupying it. The capture of the entire region is widely seen as a Kremlin war objective.\n\nKyiv's Western allies, however, see it as a fight for marginal gains on a stretch of front where neither side can make a big breakthrough, a sideshow from battles further north and south, where Ukraine hopes to push through Russian lines.\n\n\"Even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, it's not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself,\" U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House, \"and it certainly isn't going to stop the Ukrainians or slow them down.\"\n\nWithin Russia, victory in Soledar could boost ultra-nationalist mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose Wagner Group of fighters-for-hire, including convicts recruited from prison with promises of pardons, has focused on the fight in that area. He has griped as the regular military has taken credit for the Soledar battle without mentioning his fighters.\n\nOn Friday evening the defence ministry, which had not mentioned Wagner in its initial communication claiming to have captured Soledar, issued a second statement seeking \"to clarify\" the situation.\n\n\"As for the direct storming of Soledar's city quarters occupied by the armed forces of Ukraine, this combat task was successfully accomplished by the courageous and selfless actions of volunteers from the Wagner assault detachments,\" it said.\n\nNEW WEAPONS\n\nThe new year has brought important pledges of extra Western weapons for Ukraine, which is seeking armour to mount mechanised battles against Russian tanks.\n\nMajor new announcements of weapons are likely next week, when U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin hosts defence chiefs from other allies at a U.S. air base in Germany for a meeting of the contact group set up to provide support for Ukraine.\n\nLast week, France, Germany and the United States pledged to send armoured fighting vehicles. Discussion in Europe this week have focused on supplying main battle tanks, a major potential upgrade for Kyiv.\n\nOn Friday, Finland joined Poland in saying it could send German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine as part of a Western coalition apparently being put together to supply them.\n\nThat requires the permission of Berlin, which has previously been hesitant but has lately signalled a willingness to allow it. A German government spokesperson said on Friday Berlin had yet to receive any formal request for permission to re-export the tanks.\n\nReporting by Reuters bureaus; Writing by Peter Graff, Alex Richardson and Idrees Ali; Editing by Philippa Fletcher, Hugh Lawson and Daniel Wallis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nSummary No sign of casualties at site of the strike - witness\n\nRussia says it carried out revenge attack on Ukraine\n\nClaims it killed over 600 Ukrainian troops\n\nUkraine army official dismisses claim as untrue\n\nKRAMATORSK, Ukraine, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk missed its targets and there were no obvious signs of casualties, a Reuters reporter said on Sunday, after Moscow claimed the strike killed 600 Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nA Reuters team visited two college dormitories that Moscow said had been temporarily housing Ukrainian personnel and which it had targeted as revenge for a New Year's attack that killed scores of Russian soldiers and caused outcry in Russia.\n\nBut neither dormitory in the eastern city of Kramatorsk appeared to have been directly hit or seriously damaged. There were no obvious signs that soldiers had been living there and no sign of bodies or traces of blood.\n\nSerhiy Cherevatyi, a Ukrainian military spokesperson for the eastern region, described the claim of mass casualties as an attempt by the Russian defence ministry to show it had responded forcefully to Ukraine's recent strikes on Russian soldiers.\n\n\"This is an information operation of the Russian defense ministry,\" Cherevatyi told Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne News.\n\nAuthorities in Kyiv did not immediately comment. Kramatorsk's mayor earlier said there had been no casualties.\n\nAs Moscow's invasion of Ukraine grinds towards the one-year mark, Russia's military is under domestic pressure for battlefield successes. Hawkish voices have sought an escalation of the war effort after setbacks including loss of captured territory and high rates of death and injury.\n\nBad winter weather has hindered fighting on the front lines, although a cold snap that freezes and hardens up the ground could pave the way for both sides to launch offensives with heavy equipment, Serhiy Haidai, governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region said.\n\nThere have also been growing concerns that Belarus - a close ally of the Kremlin - could be used as a staging post to attack Ukraine from the north after military activity including planned joint aviation drills in the country and a fresh transfer of Russian troops there.\n\nREVENGE ATTACK\n\nRussia's defence ministry, in a statement, said the strike on the buildings in Kramatorsk was a revenge operation for the deadly Ukrainian attack last week on a Russian barracks in Makiivka, in part of the Donetsk region controlled by Moscow's forces, in which at least 89 servicemen were killed.\n\nIt said Moscow had used what it called reliable intelligence to target the Ukrainian troops. More than 700 Ukrainian troops had been housed in one hostel and more than 600 in another, it said.\n\n\"As a result of a massive missile strike on these temporary deployment points of Ukrainian army units, more than 600 Ukrainian servicemen were destroyed,\" the defence ministry said.\n\nIf true, it would be the single largest loss of Ukrainian troops since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 last year. Neither side in the war, now in its eleventh month, usually disclose losses.\n\nUkraine was believed to have stopped housing troops close together in single facilities after a deadly Russian missile strike on a base in western Ukraine in March which killed dozens.\n\nThe practice of housing soldiers all together came into focus too after Ukraine's New Year's Day strike, with Russian military commanders subject to fierce criticism inside Russia for not dispersing their forces.\n\n'A NORMAL DAY'\n\nIn Kramatorsk, residents in the populated area around the dormitories described the force of the explosion that rocked their homes overnight but said it was not out of the ordinary for the region, close to the eastern front.\n\nThe residents said they heard explosions shortly after 11 p.m. local time - midnight Moscow time - when a ceasefire declared by Russia for Eastern Orthodox Christmas had been due to end.\n\nThe Russian statement named two buildings, the dormitory of a site called College No.47 and a dormitory affiliated with College No.28, both in Kramatorsk.\n\nReuters visuals showed some of the windows broken at the College No.47 dormitory. There was a large crater in the courtyard. The windows of the nearby college had been smashed.\n\nThe College No.28 dormitory was entirely intact. A crater lay about 50 metres away from it closer to some garages. Some of the college's windows were smashed.\n\n\"It was very loud, it threw people out of their beds. Some people hurt their fingers because of the blast wave,\" said Polina, 74, a resident who lives across from one of the dormitories.\n\n\"There was an explosion, and then another explosion. The windows shook... Really, there's nothing else to tell you. Just a normal day,\" said Mykhailo, a 41-year-old resident.\n\nOleksandr Honcharenko, Kramatorsk's mayor, said the attack had damaged two educational facilities and eight apartment buildings and garages but that there had been no casualties.\n\nPavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine's governor of Donetsk, had said earlier that Russia had launched seven missile strikes on Kramatorsk.\n\nRussia has repeatedly shelled Kramatorsk, which is also in the Donetsk region, one of four regions Moscow claims to have formally incorporated into Russia, something Ukraine and most countries in the world do not recognise.\n\nKramatorsk lies a few miles northwest of Bakhmut, a small city which Russia has been trying to take for more than five months in a brutal battle which has become the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in recent weeks.\n\nUkrainian officials earlier said at least two people had been killed elsewhere in Russian overnight bombing after the unilateral Russian Orthodox Christmas ceasefire had expired.\n\nA 50-year-old man had been killed in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, Oleh Synehubov, the governor of the region, said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nAnother person had been killed in overnight attack on Soledar, close to Bakhmut, local officials said.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nReporting by Reuters Writing by Andrew Osborn and Tom Balmforth; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Maxim Shipenkov/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\nRussia has once again shaken up its military command in Ukraine in the latest sign of its faltering invasion.\n\nGen. Valery Gerasimov, who helped plan Russias stumbling invasion in February and who had served as President Vladimir V. Putins military chief of general staff for over a decade, has replaced Gen. Sergei Surovikin as the head of the Russian forces in Ukraine, the Defense Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nGeneral Surovikin, who had previously commanded Russian forces in Syria and was installed to lead Russias campaign in Ukraine in October, is now one of General Gerasimovs three deputies, according to the statement.\n\nAnalysts said the replacement of General Surovikin, a respected commander inside the Russian military, with a Kremlin apparatchik like General Gerasimov who served as an architect of the invasion, including the failed battle plan to take over Kyiv in the first days of the war showed that President Vladimir V. Putin remains focused on projecting stability rather than improving Russias darkening military outlook.\n\n\"They have taken someone who is competent and replaced him with someone who is incompetent, but who has been there a long time and who has shown that he is loyal,\" said Dara Massicot, senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation in Washington. \"Whatever is happening in Moscow, it is out of touch with what is happening on the ground in Ukraine.\"\n\nIn October, General Surovikins appointment to lead Russian forces in Ukraine ended months of disjointed military operations that analysts said contributed to Russias disastrous battlefield performance. His appointment came after the Ukrainians recovered thousands of square miles of territory in a lightning counteroffensive in the northeast of the country.\n\nUnder General Surovikin, the Russian military largely switched to a defensive mode, allowing it to reduce the military failures that had characterized the first half year of the war. He was able to conduct an orderly retreat from the southern city of Kherson, the only Ukrainian provincial capital captured by Russian forces in nearly a year since the invasion.\n\nBut General Surovikin, who earned a reputation for ruthlessness in Syria, also launched waves of missile and drone attacks intended to cripple the Ukrainian energy grid as winter set in. The strategy seemed intended to demoralize Ukrainian civilians and erode the will to fight.\n\nHis replacement with General Gerasimov was met with derision from some nationalist Russian military bloggers, who have compared the reshuffle to a game of musical chairs among Moscows ineffectual military old guard. The bloggers have become increasingly vocal in recent weeks in calling for an overhaul of Russias approach to war to protect its shrinking gains in Ukraine against an increasingly well-armed and -trained opponent.\n\n\"The sum does not change, just by changing the places of its parts,\" a prominent military blogger, who posts on the Telegram messaging app under the name of Rybar, wrote.",

And unfortunately, we lost a lot of men,\" said Sergey.\n\nAnother special forces member named Gora added, \"They split into small sub-units in order to avoid our artillery and they infiltrate through residential areas and tree lines, but they also suffer huge casualties.\"\n\nBoth sides have suffered heavy losses in the battle for the city, with Moscow desperate to sell any win back home after repeated humiliations and Ukraine determined to win back occupied territory.\n\nSeizing nearby Soledar, a town about 15km (six miles) away, would help Moscows forces encircle Bakhmut and attack from a new direction in the north.\n\nConflicting reports make the situation in Soledar unclear, as Russian officials say the town has been captured, while Ukraines leadership says fierce fighting is continuing.\n\nDescribed as one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war, Moscows capture of Soledar would be a significant victory following substantial battlefield setbacks throughout the second half of 2022.\n\n\"Soledar remains under control of our military, though there is street fighting and also fighting outside of the city because the enemy is trying to advance in several directions. The enemy is incurring huge losses,\" Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a video posted on the Telegram app on Saturday.\n\nMore symbolic than strategic\n\nMoscow has painted the battle for Soledar and Bakhmut as key to capturing the eastern region of the Donbas, encompassing the partially occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russia has said controlling those areas would help tie down the best Ukrainian soldiers and prevent them from launching counteroffensives elsewhere.\n\nBut that cuts both ways as Ukraine has said its fierce defence of the eastern strongholds has helped bog down Russian forces. Western officials and analysts have argued the two towns importance is more symbolic than strategic.\n\nAnalysts have said even if Russian forces were to seize Soledar, it would not mean Bakhmut would immediately fall, nor would it seriously threaten Ukrainian troops in the region.\n\n\"Such a victory [in Soledar] is unlikely to presage an imminent Russian encirclement of Bakhmut,\" the US-based Institute for the Study of War think tank said.\n\nOleksandr Musiyenko, a Kyiv-based analyst, noted the fall of Soledar \"would not mean the Ukrainian defensive line or front have collapsed and that it would be necessary to fall back to new defensive lines\".\n\nSoledar is located in Ukraines Donetsk region, which Moscow unilaterally claimed to have annexed in September despite only occupying part of the area. The capture of the region is widely seen as a key Kremlin war objective.\n\nBut Kyiv and the West have played down Soledars significance, saying Moscow sacrificed wave upon wave of soldiers and mercenaries in a pointless fight for a bombed-out wasteland.\n\nMorale booster\n\nAl Jazeeras Charles Stratford, reporting from Bakhmut, said Ukraines military believed Russia has deployed more than 600 new troops to help capture the city.\n\nThe streets are virtually deserted and the sound of exploding artillery and rockets is almost constant. Ukrainian forces watch Russian advances through drones as they work to prepare new lines of defence.\n\n\"Russian forces are gradually surrounding Bakhmut,\" said Stratford.\n\nFor Russia, control of Bakhmut would likely lay the groundwork for a push northwest, towards the larger cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, Branislav Slantchev, at the University of California, San Diego, told The Hill.\n\nCapturing Bakhmut would be a tremendous \"morale booster\" for the Russian war effort and would also pose difficulties for Ukraine in settlements across Donetsk, he said.\n\n\"Its an important transport hub, a lot of supply lines go through there and Russia could use it as a base. Its fairly well fortified so it would be difficult to take it back,\" Slantchev explained.",

                "cc_text": "The Pentagon is planning to bring Ukrainian troops into the United States for training on the Patriot missile defense system, U.S. officials said Tuesday, signaling the Biden administration's latest test of Russian President Vladimir Putin's threshold for Western intervention in the conflict.\n\nThe training will occur at Fort Sill, an expansive facility covering roughly 145 square miles southwest of Oklahoma City, and could begin as soon as next week. The base is home to the U.S. military's basic Patriot missile defense training program and another curriculum designed to teach American personnel field artillery maneuvers.\n\nThe United States has operated training programs for Ukrainian troops for years. It beefed up those programs after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. Last year, the Pentagon trained around two dozen Ukrainians in the United States on how to use the Phoenix Ghost drone.\n\nOver the years, Ukrainian pilots have also trained with the California Air National Guard, both in California and in Ukraine.\n\nMost of the recent training on U.S. weapons systems for Ukraine has taken place in Germany, but in the case of the Patriot system, Pentagon officials had indicated that they were considering training the Ukrainians in the United States.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said last week the country was looking at options to \"include potential training here in the U.S., overseas or a combination of both.\" For the Biden administration, the U.S.-based training does not risk escalation with Russia.\n\nThe move follows President Joe Biden's decision last month approving the transfer of a Patriot system to Ukraine, which for weeks has endured blistering Russian missile attacks on its energy grid and other vital infrastructure. Germany is also sending Ukraine a Patriot missile system from its stockpiles.\n\nRyder told reporters Tuesday that the training will prepare 90 to 100 Ukrainian soldiers to \"operate, maintain and sustain\" the defensive system through instruction that will take \"several months.\" That's the same number required to operate a Patriot battery, which typically includes eight launchers each capable of carrying between four and 16 ready-to-fire missiles, depending on the type of munition.\n\nAmerican troops typically receive about a year of training on the Patriot before using it in the field. The Pentagon is looking for ways to compress that timeline for Ukrainian forces, given the urgent need to get them schooled up and sent back home.\n\n\"We certainly don't want to do anything that would jeopardize their ability to continue to fight,\" Ryder said. \"But ultimately, that's a decision for the Ukrainians to make, in terms of how many troops they can afford to have come off the line in order to do the training.\"\n\nRelying on Fort Sill, where a school already is established, will help the United States \"expedite\" the training under the instruction of U.S. Army personnel, Ryder said. Working separately from U.S. students, Ukrainian soldiers will receive instruction in classrooms, on the Patriot system itself, and in a simulation lab, he said.\n\nThe Pentagon has no other plans to bring Ukrainian forces to the United States for training on additional weapons systems, Ryder added, though he would not rule out that possibility should a future need arise. The administration, he said, is remaining \"flexible.\"\n\nRUSSIA WARNINGS\n\nPutin has seethed at NATO nations' involvement in the war, calling efforts by the United States and its allies to train and arm Ukraine acts of complicity. He has warned repeatedly that, if Russia feels threatened by outside forces, it won't hesitate to retaliate.\n\nFor its part, the Kremlin has turned to fellow U.S. adversaries, Iran and North Korea, for help replenishing its weapons stocks as Western sanctions have strained its defense industry.\n\nFirst used in combat during the Gulf War to take out Iraqi Scud missiles, the Patriot system relies on a sophisticated radar to find incoming threats, including cruise and ballistic missiles, and launches long-range missiles to intercept them. Typically deployed on the back of a truck, it requires a crew of at least three soldiers to operate, with extensive backup needed to keep it functional.\n\nThe plan to conduct the training at Fort Sill comes as the Biden administration makes a series of moves to transform the Ukrainian military from a force primarily capable of halting the Russian advance into one that can mount more successful offensive operations intended to reclaim occupied Ukrainian territory.\n\nSenior U.S. officials have said the Pentagon also is preparing to train hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers at a time at an American facility in Germany, focusing them on what the U.S. military calls combined-arms warfare. The concept integrates ground operations with long-range artillery, aviation and other weapons.\n\nBiden in recent weeks also has approved a broad expansion of weapons transfers to Ukraine, with the United States agreeing to send heavily armored Bradley fighting vehicles, self-propelled artillery and thousands of rounds of ammunition to support them.\n\nIt's an effort, senior defense official Laura Cooper last week, intended to \"change the dynamic\" on the battlefield and enable Ukrainian forces to make greater progress along the war's front lines, which have stayed mostly static for months.\n\nThe package approved Friday included more than $3 billion in military assistance, the single largest transfer since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The United States has approved the transfer of $24.2 billion in weapons since the invasion.\n\n'WHAT MADNESS LOOKS LIKE'\n\nRussian forces are escalating their onslaught against Ukrainian positions around the wrecked city of Bakhmut, Ukrainian officials said, bringing new levels of death and devastation in the grinding, monthslong battle for control of eastern Ukraine that is part of Moscow's wider war.\n\n\"Everything is completely destroyed. There is almost no life left,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday of the scene around Bakhmut and the nearby Donetsk province city of Soledar, known for salt mining and processing.\n\n\"The whole land near Soledar is covered with the corpses of the occupiers and scars from the strikes,\" Zelenskyy said. \"This is what madness looks like.\"\n\nLate Tuesday, the head of the Wagner Group, a Russian private military contractor, Dmitry Prigozhin, claimed in audio reports posted on his Russian social media platform that his forces had seized control of Soledar, with battles continuing in a \"cauldron\" in the city's center. Ukrainian officials did not comment on the claim, and The Associated Press was unable to verify it.\n\nThe U.K. Defense Ministry said earlier that Russian troops alongside soldiers from the Wagner Group had advanced in Soledar and \"are likely in control of most of the settlement.\"\n\nThe ministry said taking Soledar, 6 miles north of Bakhmut, was likely Moscow's immediate military objective and part of a strategy to encircle Bakhmut. But it added that \"Ukrainian forces maintain stable defensive lines in depth and control over supply routes\" in the area.\n\nRussia illegally annexed Donetsk and three other Ukrainian provinces in September, but its troops have struggled to advance.\n\nAfter Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson in November, the battle heated up around Bakhmut.\n\nUkraine's deputy defense minister, Hanna Malyar, said Russia has thrown \"a large number of storm groups\" into the fight for the city. \"The enemy is advancing literally on the bodies of their own soldiers and is massively using artillery, rocket launchers and mortars, hitting their own troops,\" she said.\n\nPavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk region's Kyiv-appointed governor, described Tuesday the Russian attacks on Soledar and Bakhmut as relentless.\n\n\"The Russian army is reducing Ukrainian cities to rubble using all kinds of weapons in their scorched-earth tactics,\" Kyrylenko said in televised remarks. \"Russia is waging a war without rules, resulting in civilian deaths and suffering.\"\n\nWounded soldiers arrive around the clock for emergency treatment at a Ukrainian medical stabilization center near the front line around Bakhmut.\n\nThe Moscow-backed leader of the occupied areas of Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state TV control over the city would create \"good prospects\" for taking over Bakhmut, as well as Siversk, a town farther north where Ukrainian fortifications \"are also quite serious.\"\n\nAn exceptional feature of the fighting near Bakhmut is that some of it has taken place around entrances to disused salt mine tunnels which run for some 120 miles, the British intelligence report noted.\n\n\"Both sides are likely concerned that [the tunnels] could be used for infiltration behind their lines,\" it said.\n\nRUSSIAN TRAINING, SUPPLY WORRIES\n\nIn other developments, Russian Defense Minister Shoigu said Tuesday his military would use its experience in Ukraine to improve combat training.\n\nMilitary communications and control systems will be improved using artificial intelligence, Shoigu said, and troops will be given better tactical gear and equipment.\n\nThere is concern over Russia's production of weapons and other supplies its military needs for the fight in Ukraine. The deputy head of Russia's Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, warned that officials who failed to meet deadlines for such items could face criminal charges.\n\nPutin appointed Medvedev last month to head a new commission tasked with trying to solve the military's supply problems. Numerous reports have suggested Russia is running low on certain weapons and was sending some troops into battle with insufficient equipment and clothing.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced Tuesday while visiting Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, that her country would also provide $43 million to help with demining, energy infrastructure and internet connections, German news agency dpa reported.\n\nSeveral front-line cities in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk provinces have witnessed intense fighting in recent months.\n\nTogether, the provinces make up the Donbas, a broad industrial region bordering Russia that Putin identified as a focus from the war's outset and where Moscow-backed separatists have fought since 2014.\n\nRussia's grinding eastern offensive captured almost all of Luhansk during the summer. Donetsk escaped the same fate, and the Russian military subsequently poured manpower and resources around Bakhmut.\n\nTaking Bakhmut would disrupt Ukraine's supply lines and open a route for Russian forces to press toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, key Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk.\n\nLike Mariupol and other contested cities, Bakhmut endured a long siege without water and power even before Moscow launched massive strikes to take out public utilities across Ukraine.\n\nKyrylenko, the Donetsk region's governor, estimated more than two months ago that 90% of Bakhmut's prewar population of over 70,000 had fled since Moscow focused on seizing the entire Donbas.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said at least four civilians were killed and another 30 wounded in Russian shelling between Monday and Tuesday.\n\nVitaliy Kim, the governor of the southern Mykolaiv region, said Russian forces shelled the port of Ochakiv and the area around it late Monday and again early Tuesday. He said 15 people, including a 2-year-old child, were wounded.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Dan Lamothe of The Washington Post, by Helene Cooper of The New York Times and by Andrew Meldrum of Associated Press.",

About two dozen of them, initially recruited by the Wagner mercenary group in circumvention of Russian law, have now returned home but will probably return to the front in a matter of weeks, according to Russia Behind Bars, a prisoners rights group.\n\nThe two dozen convicts who survived six months of intense fighting were part of the first recruitment wave of an estimated several hundred, an effort that has been led by Wagner and the groups financier, St. Petersburg business executive Yevgeniy Prigozhin, since last summer.\n\nIntense fighting is raging in eastern Ukraines Donetsk region as Ukraine forces battle against Russian troops and Wagner Group mercenaries. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nCiting convicts family members, Merkacheva said the pardons were signed in early July, around the same time the first men who accepted mercenary contracts were being transported to Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked to confirm the secret pardons, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to give a direct answer, telling reporters: \"You know that a pardon can only be carried out by presidential decree in strict accordance with the law.\"\n\nPrigozhin, a former convict himself, personally toured several Russian prison colonies last year, offering recruits lucrative salaries and dangling pardons on the condition that they serve and survive half a year as part of shock troops, infantry units that are tasked with leading offensives and usually suffer heavy casualties. Recruits were often sent into battle with poor gear and little to no training.\n\nThe prisoners served as reinforcements for the initial Russian force in Ukraine, which was depleted in a string of early combat failures.\n\nThe United States estimates that Wagner now has 50,000 troops deployed in Ukraine, including 10,000 contractors and 40,000 convicts recruited from prisons. That assessment matches data collected by Russia Behind Bars, which is tracking the prisoners involvement in the war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia Behind Bars and other rights groups were alarmed by both the moral and legal implications of Moscow tapping into such an unorthodox reserve of workers. In many cases, it meant handing high-powered weapons to prisoners accused of violent crimes who had spent years in a brutal Russian penitentiary system creating a security risk and a greater danger of battlefield atrocities in Ukraine, the advocacy groups said.\n\nMoreover, they said, deploying convicts without any legal basis made a mockery of the justice system.\n\nAs mercenary service remains officially illegal in Russia, it was unclear that there were any guarantees that the fighters would receive what was promised to them.\n\nThe former inmates vulnerable position also apparently allowed Wagner to engage in extrajudicial executions of convicts who violated a set of rules laid down by Prigozhin, which banned alcohol and drugs and mandated capital punishment for desertion.\n\nDespite their newfound freedom, the prisoners will probably return to Ukraine after a few weeks rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They were all given dumb phones,\" said Olga Romanova, director of Russia Behind Bars. \"After 45 days, it will ring, and they will be called back.\" Romanova added: \"They all signed renewal contracts. Those who did not sign perished on the front line.\"\n\nRomanova said that the fighters had no choice but to sign and that the ex-convicts were promised that Wagner would not use them as shock troops anymore but would instead assign them to an undisclosed special unit tasked with tracking Ukrainian \"sabotage and reconnaissance groups.\"\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\"The decree may be secret, so it appears they are secretly being pardoned in bulk before they are taken from prisons,\" Romanova said, adding that the secrecy of these orders may complicate the pardon process as convicts technically cannot show the decree to the police or corrections officers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is a lousy piece of paper, as without the presidential decree itself, this cannot work, and no one has seen it,\" she said. \"But now, of course, everything is possible.\"\n\nLast week, RIA Novosti published a video showing Prigozhin congratulating two dozen convicts on completing their contracts.\n\n\"You have finished your contract with honor and dignity,\" he can be heard saying in the video. \"Dont drink too much, dont take drugs, dont rape women.\"\n\nIn the video, Prigozhin then asks the men about their plans for the near future. \"To come back and finish what we started,\" the group responds in unison.\n\nIn another video, released last week by the Prigozhin-affiliated website RIA Fan, the mercenary chief is seen promising medals and pardons to another group of several dozen wounded Wagner fighters recovering in the Black Sea resort town of Anapa. In the clip, several fighters thank Prigozhin for \"changing their lives\" and say they aim to return to the Wagner company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you are alive and well, everything is in order, legs and arms are in place: You either return to us, or go home, but dont make trouble,\" Prigozhin said. \"The police should treat you with respect. There is a pardon, a paper, gratitude from the head of the republic and a medal for courage. There are no exceptions yet those who can be considered one are not with us here.\"\n\nRussian-language news outlet Agentstvo identified several of the fighters in the video, most of whom have served time for murder, robbery or fraud. Among them was Dmitry Karyagin, who killed his 87-year-old grandmother, a war veteran, and stole money she received from selling her apartment, Agentsvo reported.\n\nWagner has emerged as a key fighting force in Ukraine. It was credited with critical strategic wins over the summer and openly praised by Russian state media, putting an end to the years-long open secret of the groups very existence.\n\nMost recently, Wagner forces claimed to capture territory near the town of Soledar in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine. Russian military commentators and Prigozhin have promoted this feat in anticipation that Wagner forces may soon capture the nearby city of Bakhmut.\n\nOn Monday, Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of Ukraines ground forces, visited troops fighting to defend these two cities and said Wagners successes were exaggerated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The enemy again made a desperate attempt to storm the city of Soledar in different directions,\" Syrsky said, adding: \"The enemy suffered significant losses and once again retreated.\"",

It drops silently through the freezing air before crashing noisily on to the lorry's cab.\n\nThe drone zips back to the landing site where it is reloaded and the pilots see if they can score another bullseye.\n\nI am here in snow-covered parkland on the outskirts of Kyiv, watching trainee volunteer drone pilots learn how to master the controls of their unmanned aircraft.\n\nWithin days the young pilots may be doing this for real against Russian forces in Donetsk or Zaporizhzhia, part of a squadron of civilian-flown drones that embody one of the defining technological advances of the war.\n\nThe ominous whirr of drone rotors has joined shellfire and gunshots to form the soundtrack to the war along the country's front lines.\n\nSome of the weapons and military equipment sent to Ukraine so far\n\nBoth sides use hundreds, if not thousands, of drones. The Ukrainians have taken supplies of Turkey's Bayraktar TB2 armed drones. These unmanned aircraft can fly at 25,000 feet before swooping down to attack targets. Meanwhile, the Phoenix Ghost Tactical Unmanned Aerial System is a loitering munition able to hover for up to six hours conducting surveillance before dropping and blowing up a small target such as a person. The US also provided 700 of its Switchblade kamikaze drones.\n\nFor its part, Russia has augmented its domestic drone forces with shipments of the Iranian Shahed 136 unmanned aerial vehicles and launched hundreds of these drones at Ukraine's cities and civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe one-way, or kamikaze, aircraft typically fly over urban areas before nosediving and detonating their 40kg warheads.\n\nIt is not only military designed or battlefield types of drones that have had an effect there is a makeshift fleet of re-purposed and adapted commercial drones and, on the Ukrainian side at least, bespoke home-made craft.\n\nThese unmanned civilian craft act as spies, as spotters to guide in artillery strikes, or as bombers themselves by dropping munitions on enemies below.\n\nThe Ukrainians' drone effort relies on an army of hobbyists, enthusiasts, engineers and students who have lent their skills and know-how to the military.\n\n\"War is a very dynamic story,\" says Serhiy Ristenko, the instructor training the new pilots in open ground outside Kyiv.\n\n\"Now many organisations are engaged not only in the purchase of drones, but also in training.\"\n\nBefore Russia's full-scale invasion in February, he was an amateur drone enthusiast using his craft to take landscape photographs around the capital.\n\nHe has since turned his drone skills to warfare in the country's east and the south, working for a drone group called Aerorozvidka, which consists of hundreds of volunteers.\n\n\"I have dead occupiers to my credit,\" he told the National.\n\nAerorozvidka has been operating since Vladimir Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea and his encroachment into eastern Ukraine.\n\nDrone hobbyists quickly saw the advantage that even cheap hobby drones could provide for the country's overwhelmed and beleaguered forces.\n\n\"Drones are important for reconnaissance because they save lives and you don't have to physically go and risk yourself,\" Mr Ristenko says\n\n\"It is also the accuracy of information.\n\n\"The commander can operate on data from a distance, having images and data from the drone that he can share with a tank or artillery unit.\"\n\nUkrainians believe the flexibility and ingenuity of their volunteer drone groups give them an edge over Russia's military. Getty Images\n\nDrones that can drop small bombs were next, sometimes custom made and sometimes adapted from common commercially available models.\n\nAerorozvidka's engineers and volunteers now build its own eight-rotor craft called the R-18, which can carry a hefty payload of 5kg. Each set for the battlefield costs about $45,000, including costly thermal cameras to work at night, a control point and a ground radio station.\n\nSoviet-era RKG-3 anti-tank grenades are fitted with 3D printed tails to turn them into bombs that can be dropped.\n\n\"We usually use this drone to destroy equipment and vehicles that cannot be reached by artillery or infantry,\" he says. \"Our drone is like a flying mortar.\"\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman about to launch a drone on the outskirts of Bakhmut, eastern Ukraine. AFP\n\nSimilar outfits produce other drones, or modify cheap commercial drones, such as the DJI Mavic series.\n\nThe results can be seen in a steady stream of videos shared by both sides on social media with bombs dropped on to vehicles, or into foxholes and trenches.\n\nWhile Russian forces also use drones to deadly effect, the Ukrainians believe the flexibility and ingenuity of their volunteer drone groups give them an edge.\n\nAnother drone operator, Yevhen, said that while the Ukrainian military could still be hidebound and full of bureaucracy at the higher levels, individual commanders had scope to take their own decisions and were prepared to take risks and use new tools.\n\nUnits at the front often approach drone workshops and groups like Aerorozvidka. Craft were bought by donations and crowd-funding.\n\n\"The first unofficial motto of Aerorozvidka was 'We fight with our heads',\" he said. \"We must be super efficient to defeat the enemy.\"\n\nA tank fires a round, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Soledar A tank, seen left, fires a round in Soledar, a town in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Reuters\n\nSmall civilian-designed drones have been used in previous conflicts, including the Syrian war, but analysts say the Ukraine conflict is a step change in the scale and sophistication of their use.\n\nThe most sensitive part of the drone contest between Ukraine and Russia is electronic warfare, says Maxim Sheremet, an engineering academic who runs his own drone production line manned by his students.\n\nThe adversaries are in a battle to jam or block their opponent's remotely controlled aircraft, with the Russian side particularly adept at using electronic interference.\n\nBack at the drone flying school, the trainees have several days more teaching ahead of them.\n\nBy the time they reach this stage, they often already have significant experience on smaller drones, but need to master the controls of the R-18, Mr Ristenko says.\n\n\"Probably the most difficult part of training is controlling a drone, because our drone has its own nuances and it differs from those drones that students previously operated,\" he says.\n\n\"Usually, we spend one to two days on the theory of flight techniques, and then the practice of aiming and dropping bombs.\"\n\nThe pool of skilled pilots is becoming larger and they are willing to share their expertise, he says. There is also no shortage of willing recruits.\n\nDrones have become so ubiquitous in the war that he sees their use becoming a standard part of military tactics and training.\n\n\"Now there are talks about making training in drone control mandatory for military personnel, that is, a person who joins the army learns not only how to shoot, but also how to fly a drone.\"",

Russia may be rationing artillery rounds due to low supplies, or it could be part of a broader reassessment of tactics in the face of successful Ukrainian offenses.\n\nEither way, the striking decline in artillery fire is further evidence of Russias increasingly weak position on the battlefield nearly a year into its invasion, US and Ukrainian officials told CNN. It also comes as Ukraine is enjoying increased military support from its western allies, with the US and Germany announcing last week that they will be providing Ukrainian forces for the first time with armored fighting vehicles, as well as another Patriot Defense missile battery that will help protect its skies.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, is apparently clambering to shore up domestic political support, US intelligence officials believe, for a war he initially would only describe as a limited \"special military operation.\"\n\nUS officials believe the 36-hour ceasefire Putin ordered in Ukraine last week to allow for the observance of Orthodox Christmas was an attempt to pander to Russias extensive Christian population, two people familiar with the intelligence told CNN, as well as an opportunity for Putin to blame Ukrainians for breaking it and paint them as heretical heathens.\n\nUkrainian artillerymen fire at a position on the front line near the town of Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, on October 31, 2022 Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe bucket is getting smaller\n\nMuch of the domestic opposition Putin and his generals have faced over the handling of the war has come from one of the Russian leaders closest allies: Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the mercenary organization Wagner Group. Prigozhin has complained that the Russian Ministry of Defense has botched the war effort, and that Wagner Group should be given more equipment, authority and autonomy to carry out operations in Ukraine.\n\nBut Wagner Group has lost thousands of fighters in Ukraine the last two months alone, a senior US official said.\n\nWorkers remove debris of a destroyed building purported to have housed Russian soldiers killed in a Ukrainian missile strike, January 3, 2023. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nRussia suffered another setback earlier this month when Ukrainian forces hit a weapons depot in Makiivka in eastern Ukraine, destroying more Russian supplies and killing scores of Russian troops housed nearby. The strike also raised questions among prominent Russian military bloggers about the basic competence of the Russian military brass, which had apparently decided to house hundreds of Russian troops next to an obvious Ukrainian target.\n\n\"Maybe this one strike is a drop in the bucket, but the bucket is getting smaller,\" a US defense official said, referring to the Russians dwindling stockpiles.\n\n40-year-old shells\n\nTo date, questions about Russias stockpile of weapons have mostly focused on their precision-guided munitions, such as cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. But US officials said their dramatically reduced rate of artillery fire may indicate that the prolonged and brutal battle has had a significant effect on Russias supply of conventional weapons as well.\n\nLast month, a senior US military official said that Russia has had to resort to 40-year-old artillery shells as their supply of new ammo dwindled. To the US, the use of degraded ammunition, as well as the Kremlins outreach to countries like North Korea and Iran, was a sign of Russias diminished stocks of weaponry.\n\nThe rationing of ammunition and lower rate of fire appears to be a departure from Russian military doctrine, which traditionally calls for the heavy bombardment of a target area with massive artillery fire and rocket fire. That strategy played out in cities like Mariupol and Melitopol as Russian forces used the punishing strikes to drive slow, brutal advances in Ukraine.\n\nOfficials said the strategy shift could be the doing of the recently installed Russian theater commander, General Sergey Surovikin, who the US believes is more competent than his predecessors.\n\nUkraine has had little choice but to ration its ammunition since the beginning of the war. Ukrainian troops rapidly burned through their own supply of Soviet-era 152 mm ammunition when the conflict erupted, and while the US and its allies have provided hundreds of thousands of rounds of Western 155 mm ammunition, even this supply has had its limits.\n\nAs a result, Ukraine has averaged firing around 4,000-7,000 artillery rounds per day far fewer than Russia.\n\nIt looks ridiculous now\n\nThe Russians declining rate of fire is not linear, one US defense official noted, and there are days when Russians still fire far more artillery rounds particularly around the eastern Ukrainian cities of Bakhmut and Kreminna, as well as some near Kherson in the south.\n\nUS and Ukrainian officials have offered widely different estimates of Russian fire, with US officials saying the rate has dropped from 20,000 rounds per day to around 5,000 per day on average. Ukraine estimates that the rate has dropped from 60,000 to 20,000 per day.\n\nBut both estimates point to a similar downward trend.\n\nA Ukrainian self-propelled artillery shoots towards Russian forces at a frontline in Kharkiv region, Ukraine, Saturday, December 24, 2022. Evgeniy Maloletka/AP\n\nWhile Russia still has more artillery ammunition available than Ukraine does, early US assessments vastly overestimated the amount that Russia had its disposal, a US military official said, and underestimated how well the Ukrainians would do at hitting Russian logistics sites.\n\nIt appears now that Russia is focused more on bolstering its defense fortifications, particularly in central Zaporizhzhia, the UK Ministry of Defense reported in its regular intelligence update on Sunday. The movements suggest that Moscow is concerned about a potential Ukrainian offensive either there or in Luhansk, the ministry said.\n\n\"A major Ukrainian breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia would seriously challenge the viability of Russias land-bridge linking Russias Rostov region and Crimea,\" the ministry said, while Ukrainian success in Luhansk would \"undermine Russias professed war aim of liberating the Donbas.\"\n\nUkraines counter-offensives last fall targeting Kherson in the south and Kharkiv in the north resulted in humiliating defeats for Russia and were aided enormously by sophisticated western weaponry like HIMARS rocket launchers, Howitzer artillery systems and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that the US had previously been reluctant to provide.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is we have been self-deterring ourselves for over a year now,\" said retired Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commander of US Army Europe and NATO Allied Land Command and currently a senior advisor for Human Rights First.\n\n\"Theres been so much anxiety about the possibility of Russias escalation I mean ten months ago, there was concern about giving Stingersobviously thats ridiculous, and it looks ridiculous now.\"\n\nRussias war with bureaucracy\n\nTensions between Kremlin defense officials and Wagner Group leaders have also been rising amid public complaints by the mercenaries that they are running low on equipment and reports that their leader, Prigozhin, wants to take control of the lucrative salt mines near Bakhmut.\n\nIn a video that ran on Russian state media, Wagner Group fighters complain that they are running low on combat vehicles, artillery shells and ammunition, which is limiting their ability to conquer Bakhmut shortages Prigozhin then blames on \"internal bureaucracy and corruption.\"\n\n\"This year we will win! But first we will conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption,\" he says in the clip. \"Once we conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption, then we will conquer the Ukrainians and NATO, and then the whole world. The problem now is that the bureaucrats and those engaging in corruption wont listen to us now because for New Years they are all drinking champagne.\"\n\nDestroyed Russian armored car standing by the railway line seen from the window of an evacuation train from Kherson to Khmelnytskyi, on Sunday, December 18, 2022. Artur Widak/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nPrigozhins ambitions are not limited to greater political power, however, the US believes. There are also indications that he wants to take control over the lucrative salt and gypsum from mines near Bakhmut, a senior administration official tells CNN.\n\n\"This is consistent with Wagners modus operandi in Africa, where the groups military activities often function hand in hand with control of mining assets,\" the official said, adding that the US believes these monetary incentives are driving Prigozhin and Russias \"obsession\" with taking Bakhmut.\n\nThe official also said that Wagner Group has suffered heavy casualties in its operations near Bakhmut since late November.\n\n\"Out of its force of nearly 50,000 mercenaries (including 40,000 convicts), the company has sustained over 4,100 killed and 10,000 wounded, including over 1,000 killed between late November and early December near Bakhmut,\" the official said, adding that about 90% of those killed were convicts.\n\nThe official said that Russia \"cannot sustain these kinds of losses.\"\n\n\"If Russia does eventually seize Bakhmut, Russia will surely characterize this, misleadingly, as a major victory,\" the official added. \"But we know that is not the case. If the cost for each 36 square miles of Ukraine [the approximate size of Bakhmut] is thousands of Russians over seven months, this is the definition of Pyrrhic victory.\"",

                "cc_text": "2:24 p.m. EST\n\nMR PRICE: Good afternoon.\n\nQUESTION: Good afternoon.\n\nMR PRICE: Remember on Monday when we started precisely at 2:00 p.m., and I said, \"Remember this when we were a couple minutes late.\"\n\nQUESTION: Two minutes before.\n\nMR PRICE: Two minutes before. Exactly. So this is where Im going to ask for your forbearance and offer a reminder of better days.\n\nLets start with this. The United States welcomes the January 11th announcement by the Government of Uganda and the World Health Organization of the end of the Ebola epidemic in Uganda. We commend the Ugandan Government and our international partners on reaching this milestone. We celebrate with the survivors just as we express our condolences for those lives lost.\n\nWe support the Government of Ugandas response and response and minimize outbreak spread. The U.S. Government mobilized a comprehensive interagency response to the Ebola outbreak through the U.S. Embassy in Kampala. The State Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the Agency for International Development worked in coordination with the Government of Uganda and other key partners, such as the World Health Organization, to actively provide support in several areas vital to the response.\n\nEvery single outbreak reminds us that a health threat anywhere is a potential health threat to everyone in the world. The containment of this Ebola outbreak is just the most recent example of coordination and teamwork to keep all of us safe by preventing infectious disease threats from crossing borders.\n\nOur work with countries around the world helps to not only prevent outbreaks and to detect them early but also to respond rapidly and effectively when they do occur. While we celebrate the end of this outbreak, we redouble our commitment to work with partners in Uganda and around the world to mitigate the risk of future disease outbreaks anywhere.\n\nWith that, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Right. I wasnt actually going to ask about this, but since the Attorney General has just appointed a special counsel to look into the these classified documents that apparently ended up at the Penn Biden Center and elsewhere, Im just wondering if theres been any contact. I realize its early days yet, or minutes, but has there been any contact, given the Secretarys previous work there? Has there been any contact between the special counsel and this building?\n\nMR PRICE: So, Matt, theres not going to be much that I can say on a case like this for reasons that you well understand. You heard the President speak to this earlier in the week from Mexico City. Just as you heard from the President, the Secretary was surprised to learn that there were any government records taken to that office. As you know, as is now well known, there is a review of this matter, and so were going to let that review play out.\n\nQUESTION: You mean to\n\nQUESTION: You say that the\n\nQUESTION: When you say that office, you mean the one that he was involved in, right?\n\nMR PRICE: Thats correct. Thats correct.\n\nQUESTION: And you said the Secretary was surprised to learn. When did he learn of that\n\nMR PRICE: Im just not going to offer any additional detail. Just as the President was, he was surprised to learn that there were any government records taken to that location, had no knowledge of it at the time. But I am just not going to offer any additional detail.\n\nQUESTION: But you cant tell us when the Secretary learned that this was a matter being looked into by the White House?\n\nMR PRICE: This matter is this matter is under review, so were going to let that review proceed as it should.\n\nQUESTION: And are there any State Department documents that are part of these documents that were found as part of\n\nMR PRICE: Of course that would not be anything I would know. It is not anything the Secretary would know. As we have heard from the White House, it is not something that the President knows. This is a matter thats being investigated, being looked at by the Department of Justice. Were going to let that proceed.\n\nQUESTION: But certainly, if it has to do with work related to this department, you would hope to find that out, right?\n\nMR PRICE: If there is a need for the Department of Justice to speak to the Department of State on an investigative matter, there are channels and procedures for them to do that. They are not channels or procedures that would involve me. They are not channels or procedures that would involve most people in this building. So if there is a need, there will be, as you would expect, full cooperation. But again, were going to let this review play out.\n\nQUESTION: One more question, sorry. DOJ said that they we have reported that they have interviewed officials as part of their investigation into this. Have they interviewed any State Department officials, as far as you know?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, I am just not going to comment on this. This is a matter that is being pursued by the Department of Justice, and well let them pursue it.\n\nNazira.\n\nQUESTION: So thank you very much. I have three or four question. If you answer because today is my birthday, it will be my present.\n\nMR PRICE: Yes, happy birthday. I heard that.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you very much.\n\nOkay, number one. The day before yesterday was big attack actually yesterday morning in the ministry of foreign affairs. More than 21 young diplomat has been killed, and today ISIS or Daesh took the responsibility. And yesterday, I was at the White House. I expected that they should say something, but she was silent and didnt say anything. Thats why I come today to ask this question.\n\nAnd number two, Zamir Kabulov, Putin representative, went to Kabul, discussed with the Taliban although they did not recognize Taliban, and he announced their support to Taliban.\n\nAnd the third question. So many Afghan refugee call me from Abu Dhabi. Theyre still waiting to come to the United States. Any comment to expedite their procedure to come to the United States?\n\nMR PRICE: So, Nazira, on your first question, we condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack that took place in Kabul. Weve seen the claim of responsibility from ISIS-K. This, if ISIS-K was indeed behind this, is just the latest horrific example of a brutal group taking out, perpetrating senseless violence on the people of Afghanistan.\n\nWe send our deepest condolences to the loved ones, to the family members, of those who were killed in this senseless attack. We stand against and condemn terrorism everywhere, and of course that is the case in Afghanistan as well.\n\nWhen it comes to the Russian official that you mentioned, I would need to refer you to the Russian Government for any comment they might have on their approach to the Taliban. Our approach is well known; we have made no secret of the fact that the Talibans actions are inconsistent and at odds with what they have pledged to the international community, but more importantly what they have committed to the Afghan people.\n\nWe are always going to stand on the side of the Afghan people. We are going to continue to condemn the actions that they take that are inconsistent with the rights, with the liberties, with the freedoms, with the opportunities that should belong to the people of Afghanistan. And in doing so, we have any number of countries at our side. Just after the Taliban announced the restrictions on international NGOs, the United States, our fellow members of the so-called Group of Seven, other countries, issued a strong statement condemning this.\n\nYou have since heard other statements condemning this from countries around the world. Just today there was a strong statement from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a confederation of Muslim-majority countries that were vocal, were vociferous in their condemnation of what the Taliban is perpetrating on the women, the girls, the minorities, the people of Afghanistan.\n\nWe are going to continue to speak out with much of the rest of the world. We are going to continue to hold the Taliban to account for what they are perpetrating on the people of Afghanistan.\n\nYes, (inaudible).\n\nQUESTION: Can I move on to Libya, if I may?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: The CIA chief is or was in Libya today, and this comes a month after more or less a month after the extradition of the Lockerbie suspect in the United States. The Tripoli government got a lot of backlash for that. What kind of reassurances, or was he there to give reassurances to that to the Libyan Government?\n\nAnd then second, still related to Libya, there are reports theres a meeting of special envoys from France, Germany, the UK, and the U.S. of course, on how potentially to stage elections in Libya with the two factions have not agreed. Can you give us any details on this meeting and what your expectations are and if the U.S. is optimistic at all that there can be an agreement to have elections in Libya?\n\nMR PRICE: First the easy question: I am just not going to comment on any purported travel on the part of the CIA director, would need to refer you to the CIA to speak to any potential travel the director may be undertaking.\n\nOn the second part of your question, the report that you mentioned is not accurate. The reports of a meeting in Washington scheduled for tomorrow is erroneous. We take part in periodic consultations with key international stakeholders on how best to support the special representative of the secretary-general, SRSG Bathily, in setting the stage for elections in Libya and supporting the people of Libya. We look forward to hosting a future discussion as we have in the past, but we havent confirmed any dates at this time.\n\nWe continue to be engaged with political leaders in Libya and international partners on that very way forward in Libya. That includes a political track to establish a timeframe for elections as quickly as possible. We strongly support the special representative of the secretary-general, the call for national consensus in Libya on establishing a clear timeline for elections. We believe there is no other way to secure stability and long-term peace.\n\nWe share the desire of all Libyans to see Libyan leaders adopt the necessary measures as quickly as possible to set that electoral process in motion.\n\nHumeyra.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, what can you say about this U.S. Navy veteran who was released in Poland and former Governor Richardson was apparently instrumental in securing his release? Can you guys confirm and provide some details on what happened there?\n\nMR PRICE: Unfortunately, there is little that I can say for reasons that you all know well, but I can make a few points.\n\nFirst, were aware of reports that a U.S. citizen was deported after having been in Russian custody. Im not in a position to discuss the particulars of this case due to privacy considerations that so often limit what we can say publicly. But as we always do, I want to emphasize that this department, the Department of State, has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas.\n\nAs a general matter, and when a U.S. citizen is deported from anywhere around the world and of course this would include Russia the department may provide assistance to help facilitate the return of that citizen to the United States. And as always, we stand ready to provide appropriate assistance to all U.S. citizens overseas.\n\nTo the second part of your question regarding the Richardson Center, I of course, I would refer you there. Were likewise aware of the Richardson Centers travel, which they have announced, but not going to comment on their travel or activity in this case, again owing to those privacy considerations.\n\nQUESTION: Staying staying on this. Did you want to\n\nQUESTION: No, go for it. Yeah, go for it. I was going to\n\nQUESTION: Well, just on this. I mean, right, youre aware of reports. The statement from Governor Richardson himself names two U.S. embassy employees one from Warsaw and one from Russia.\n\nMR PRICE: Matt\n\nQUESTION: Are you saying that\n\nMR PRICE: I know this is\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, no. I think you need to go back to the lawyers in CA and say that this is getting to the point of absolute ridiculousness. You can either confirm that this guy has been turned over and that there was an embassy official there, or you can say that its not true. But saying that you dont have a Privacy Act waiver to this when it has been announced by the governor himself and the names of a diplomat in Moscow and a diplomat in Warsaw are out there for everyone to see.\n\nMR PRICE: So, Matt, I know this is a\n\nQUESTION: It is completely disingenuous for you to say that youre aware of reports.\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, it is not disingenuous. I know this is a bugaboo of yours. We are not going to find resolution to this longstanding irritant of yours today. What I can tell you, and what you seem to be disregarding, is the fact that Governor Richardson is a private citizen. Private citizens can say whatever they would like without any restriction imposed by pesky things like the Privacy Act waiver. The Privacy Act waiver applies to us; it does not apply to private citizens. It, in some cases, doesnt even apply to other entities within the Executive Branch. So to say it is disingenuous, Matt our attempt to stay within the bounds of the policies to which we are to which we adhere, that I think is\n\nQUESTION: I dont see how it impacts the Privacy Act at all for you to say, yes, we can confirm that an American citizen was deported and we took custody or we were part of a team that took custody of him or\n\nMR PRICE: And there are many cases in which we have said made analogous statements like that, because weve been a position to do so, because of various Privacy Act waivers. When we dont make statements like that, were not doing that because we want to be obtuse. Were not doing that because we want to stonewall you. Believe me, my job would be a lot easier if I could share every single detail of this case. Were doing it to be consistent with policies that apply to us.\n\nQUESTION: Im not even asking for any details. Im not even asking for a confirmation of the name, but just to say youre aware of reports that an American was deported. I mean, thats youre aware of more than reports that an American was deported, and saying only that is disingenuous.\n\nQUESTION: Are you able to sort of are you able to talk at all about his ordeal, like these nine months, and like the kinds of conversations you guys have had with the Russians and when the State Department became aware of his detention by the Russians? Are you able to talk about any of that?\n\nMR PRICE: Unfortunately, I am not. I can talk in generalities. Anytime we learn that an American citizen is incarcerated, is detained, is in the custody of a foreign government, we work to protect and to promote the interests of that individual. Oftentimes we do learn of such cases from interaction with the family. That is really what our Bureau of Consular Affairs that is the bread and butter element of their job is to work with American citizens, to work with their representatives, to work with families to devise how we can best protect and to promote the interests of Americans overseas. That is the core priority of the work we do around the world. But we also want to respect the privacy of private American citizens, however frustrating that might be.\n\nQUESTION: They posted pictures on Twitter, but sure.\n\nQUESTION: I mean\n\nQUESTION: But Ned, the treatment between previous cases and this one obviously different cases, of course, but very different. And your speech is not at all the same, right? You dont have any problem with the Privacy Act regarding certain people that were freed recently, and in this case you do. So how do you explain that?\n\nMR PRICE: Thats absolutely right, Leon, because there is something called the Privacy Act. There is something called the Privacy Act waiver. If were in a position to say more, we will; if were not, we cant.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: On that, one more thing. I mean, outside groups are referring to this as a wrongful detention. Is that a characterization that the United States Government would use? Or is that a mischaracterization?\n\nMR PRICE: We have been open and transparent because we have been in a position to do so regarding cases of wrongful detention inside of Russia. We had spoken of three cases. Two of those cases had been resolved with Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner now back in the United States, reunited with their loved ones. There is one case of wrongful detention in Russia at the moment, and that of course is the case of Paul Whelan. I say that with the very important caveat that we are always assessing the circumstances of the detention of each and every American around the world to determine if a particular case may meet the criteria thats spelled out in policy, thats spelled out in the Levinson Act to determine if those criteria are met. And when that determination is made, we will make the formal declaration that someone is wrongfully detained.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. May I stay in the region, on Ukraine? Whats your sense of the latest situation in Soledar, and also the fact that Wagner Group is increasingly becoming the face of the war? Is there any concern inside the administration that you might be too cautious or lagging behind in terms of designating Wagner Group?\n\nMR PRICE: Sorry, any concern that we might be\n\nQUESTION: Behind too cautious or lagging behind, because some other countries have already taken those steps.\n\nMR PRICE: So first a couple of things. And you know we dont tend to get into battlefield dynamics or tactical assessments from here. Some of this may be best directed to the Department of Defense. But a couple broad points.\n\nNumber one, the reason why the pitched battle over a town like Soledar a town of some 10,000 residents, at least before the war is making headlines is because of the possibility, and its not confirmed, but the possibility that the Russians are achieving or at least claiming incremental gains at heavy costs. And the fact that the Russians are in a position to at least claim incremental gains, despite these heavy costs, is not something that weve heard from Russian forces in quite some time. The Ukrainian forces, with their counteroffensive that started last year, have been extraordinarily effective at halting Russian advances, pushing Russian forces back, recapturing thousands of miles of thousands of square miles of territory, and the fact that certain Russian elements are claiming they have made some incremental progress I think speaks to the lack of the Russian ability to make such claims in quite some time.\n\nWe have been clear in our own assessments that fighting remains intense in the Donbas; it remains intense in the east where this battle is has been waged. We expect that to continue. There will continue to be incremental gains and losses, we expect, by both sides. But any incremental Russian gain, even one that comes at such heavy cost in terms of casualties and personnel and equipment, will never be able to change this tide of war. No tactical advance will be able to shift the strategic failure that President Putin and his forces have encountered from the earliest days of this war, and a strategic failure that has only intensified with the effective counteroffensive that Russia excuse me, that Ukraine has mounted.\n\nOn the question of the Wagner Group, weve seen reports and in fact, senior Wagner officials are making pronouncements from the front lines, which only underscore underscores the heavy investment on the part of Wagner forces in the effort to make some incremental advances in the town of Soledar. Of course, weve been very vocal about in condemning the involvement of Wagner, a group that has conscripted, or in some cases offered pardons to, hardened criminals, convicts, those convicted of violent crimes, who have been taken from Russian prisons and labor camps and who have offered quite literally their lives in order for the chance, however small that might be, to secure freedom at the risk profound risk that they could lose their own life or risk significant injury.\n\nWeve seen reports of tens of thousands of Wagner forces active on the battlefield, but just as partial mobilizations, just as additional calls for regular Russian forces have not been able to change the tide of battle, there is no doubt in our mind that the introduction of Wagner forces, even tens of thousands of Wagner forces, that there is no doubt in our mind that these efforts will meet the same fate that other Russian efforts have met in the face of the Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nQUESTION: Is there any reason out there that prevents you from designating this group, even given the fact that this group is illegal even by Russian laws?\n\nMR PRICE: And Wagner is designated under a number of authorities. Its leader, Mr. Prigozhin, is designated under a number of authorities. The point remains that we are looking for every appropriate and relevant authority we can to hold accountable those actors and entities that are responsible for this brutal war on the Ukrainian people. If there are additional authorities that would be permissible and appropriate and effective to wield against the Wagner Group or Prigozhin, we will evaluate that and we will implement those as we are able.\n\nQUESTION: Just to get the record straight, the U.S. has not recognized Wagner Group as a terrorist organization; thats what I mean.\n\nMR PRICE: As a foreign terrorist organization, as an FTO?\n\nQUESTION: Right.\n\nMR PRICE: We have not.\n\nQUESTION: We have not.\n\nMR PRICE: But there are a number of authorities that we have already wielded against Wagner, and well continue to look for other mechanisms to hold the group to account.\n\nYes, Cindy.\n\nQUESTION: Hi. Can I turn to U.S.-Japan-China?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Would you agree with what Defense Secretary excuse me Austin said, that he doubts that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is imminent? We had a rear admiral naval intelligence official today saying that the stakes have gone up and the danger level is something we need to take very seriously.\n\nMR PRICE: I think both things can certainly be true, and this was the point Secretary Austin was making yesterday. Of course, we dont have any formal assessments to share, but both Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin spoke to the challenge that weve seen not over the course of recent months, but over the course of recent years: assertiveness on the part of the PRC, assertiveness that, in our estimation, is an attempt to undermine the longstanding cross-strait status quo the very status quo that has maintained peace, security, stability across the Taiwan Strait for decades.\n\nJust as the PRC is attempting to chip away at the status quo with these aggressive maneuvers, with these provocations, with these implicit threats against Taiwan, we, on the other hand working hand-in-glove with our Japanese allies, with other allies in the Indo-Pacific seek only to bolster the status quo, to maintain, to preserve the status quo and the peace and stability that it has brought to the Taiwan Strait over the course of decades now.\n\nWe oppose unilateral change in the status quo by either side. We will continue just as we have with calm, resolute steps to uphold peace and security, to resolute steps to uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Part and parcel of that is the U.S.-Japan alliance. It is the cornerstone of peace, of security, of prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. And of course, that includes in the region were talking about now.\n\nThe very steps that Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin referred to yesterday the steps that will enhance our alliance, that will make it more effective, that will seek to adapt it to the challenges and the opportunities, for that matter, that we face now those are crucial elements to our efforts to advance our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, and as part of that to maintain peace and stability and to maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nQUESTION: Could you also talk a little bit about how the closer cooperation directly affects the threat from North Korea?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, of course the DPRK poses a threat to Americans on the peninsula, to our allies in the region of course, to our treaty allies, Japan and the ROK and potentially beyond. So it is a threat that we and our Japanese allies take seriously; it is a threat that we and our South Korean allies take seriously. It is a threat that trilaterally, as partners, the United States, Japan, and South Korea take extraordinarily seriously.\n\nYesterday, youve heard from Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin and their Japanese counterparts of our determination to maintain readiness, to maintain the effectiveness of our alliance, and to be in a position to deter and, as necessary, confront the threats that we face together as an alliance. One of those threats perhaps the most challenging threat to regional peace and security we face at the moment is that from the DPRK, namely its nuclear weapons program, its ballistic missile program as well.\n\nWe discussed these issues, alliance effectiveness and readiness, with our Japanese allies. We discussed them with our South Korean allies. But we are also very focused on the trilateral relationship because we know that, with the trilateral relationship, in some ways the sum is greater than its constituent parts. And we want to be prepared as allies the United States, Japan, and South Korea for the challenges, for the threats, and yes, for the opportunities as well that arise in the region.\n\nPresident Biden I think demonstrated our commitment to trilateral cooperation in Cambodia late last year when, for the first time in some five years, brought together the leaders of Japan, of South Korea. Secretary Blinken has on several occasions now brought together his counterparts from the ROK and from Japan as well. Deputy Sherman has done that. Sung Kim, our special envoy for the DPRK, routinely does that. We see it as a critical element when it comes to our effort to confront the challenges to the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific that the DPRK poses.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: So a follow-up on this. Yesterday we heard Secretary Austin specifically mentioning Article V of the security treaty between the U.S. and Japan. Why he needed to express it, because historically the article is had been there for decades? And what will how will this statement implicate itself differently other than up-to-date the historical implications of that article?\n\nMR PRICE: So Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken were referring to Article V of the Japan-U.S. mutual defense treaty yesterday, specifically in the domain of space. The Secretary and foreign minister will sign a framework agreement tomorrow at NASA, in fact, on space cooperation between the United States and Japan. This agreement has been more than a decade in the making. It covers a range of civilian space coordination from research collaboration to working together to land the first woman and person of color on the moon.\n\nAnd they also made reference to the fact for the first time that, as allies, we have decided that certain attacks in or from space may constitute may invoke Article V. Those are issues that we will look at as allies on a case-by-case basis, but again, its all part and parcel of our effort to modernize the alliance, to ensure that the alliance is strong, effective, ready across all the domains land, sea, air, cyberspace, outer space.\n\nQUESTION: And also another question. We have seen that defense minister of Russia, Shoigu, appointed Gerasimov to oversee the operations in Ukraine. What do you expect will be the implications of do you expect an escalation after Gerasimov took over the command of the Russian military operation in Ukraine?\n\nMR PRICE: Thats really a better question for the Russian Federation, what potential leadership changes may portend. From our perspective, Im reminded of one of the definitions of insanity namely, doing the same thing over and over and over again and expecting a different result. Weve seen Russia appoint various commanders of its forces inside Ukraine numerous times now, each time reaching for someone more senior, more seasoned, purportedly more effective, only to find precisely the same result, only to find a Ukrainian wall of self-defense able, committed, dedicated Ukrainian defenders that are determined to defend their country.\n\nRussia may be trying to change the dynamic once again with a new commander of Russian forces inside Ukraine, but the broader dynamic, the underlying dynamic is not going to change. That very dynamic is one in which Ukrainians are fighting for their territory. They are fighting for their country; theyre fighting for their democracy; theyre fighting for their freedom. And Russian forces are fighting a war of territorial conquest. This is not their land; this does not belong to them. Russian forces in many cases know that as well as Ukrainians do. And so that underlying dynamic is not going to change, and we are confident that the broader dynamic of this conflict Ukrainians demonstrating their effectiveness on their battlefield, defending their territory, defending their country thats not going to change either.\n\nQUESTION: Hey, Ned, on the NASA agreement that theyre going to sign tomorrow, do you have any other or any additional details on whats going to be in whats going to be in that? And then and I apologize if Im being obtuse or insensitive on this, but when you talk about landing the first woman and first person of color on the moon, are and this is a deal with the Japanese are you talking about a Japanese woman and a Japanese person of color? Or does it does that is it not that specific?\n\nMR PRICE: So this is these are in some cases better questions for NASA, and you will hear more about this at NASA tomorrow. The Secretary and others will deliver remarks there. I dont want to get ahead of what theyll have to say at NASA tomorrow.\n\nLet me move around. Yeah, go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: We saw the Secretary met yesterday with Congressman McCaul, who will be the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Im wondering if you could just give us a readout of that meeting and the expectations that the Secretary has for working with Republicans who are in the majority now in the House.\n\nMR PRICE: So theres not much Im in a position to say about that meeting yesterday, and really I should call it a day yesterday, because Chairman McCaul did have an opportunity to meet with a number of senior officials here in the building yesterday of course, not only the Secretary, but others. He was able to tour various facilities, including our China House. He was able to receive briefings on topics that are of particular interest to the new Congress but also of particular priority to us and of interest to the American people.\n\nThe Secretary believes deeply in the imperative of iterative and consistent engagement with Congress, with both houses, on a bipartisan basis. We have demonstrated that in the 117th Congress. According to records that have been put together by our Bureau of Legislative Affairs, we had more engagements with the 117th Congress last year than we had in any other recorded time in State Department history.\n\nNow, that is just one metric, and of course metrics alone dont capture quality, they dont capture other intangible aspects of it. But this Secretary is committed to engagement with this Congress. We deeply believe, truly believe, that our foreign policy will be more effective, it will convey more legitimacy when the Congress understands what it is that we are doing, why are we seeking to do it, and optimally if it has bipartisan support. Yesterdays engagement with Chairman McCaul was the start of that engagement with the 118th Congress, but we expect a lot more to come.\n\nQUESTION: And did you guys invite him or did he request the meetings? And then in terms of their investigation into the Afghanistan withdrawal, will this department be providing documents and interviews in a timely manner upon their request?\n\nMR PRICE: So as to how the meeting came about, of course we were eager to host Chairman McCaul. I will leave it to him and his office to characterize his level of interest. But again, it was a truly constructive at least from our vantage point successful engagement with the chairman yesterday.\n\nOn the various topics and regions of oversight, we are going to continue with the approach that we have exercised with the prior Congress, with the 117th Congress, with the 118th Congress. Congress has important functions: authorization function, appropriation function, and an oversight function. We believe in the utility, in the necessity of each of those functions, and we look forward to continuing our engagement with this Congress on those areas that are of interest to them and that most importantly are of priority to the American people.\n\nYes, go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, the foreign minister the Trkish foreign minister said today he will be meeting with his Syrian counterpart pretty soon in February. And as I understood, he will be visiting town, visiting Washington, in the next two days; is that right?\n\nMR PRICE: We will likely have more details on this before too long. We regularly do have an opportunity to engage with our Trkish allies given the important work that we seek to accomplish together as NATO Allies, as stalwart partners across any number of challenges and opportunities. The Secretary often does have an opportunity to speak to Minister avuolu. He sees him quite regularly at various gatherings, and I would expect theyll have an opportunity to see one another before too long in person.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: You said repeatedly last week that you do not support normalization and you made everything you made your position known by all implicitly like Trkiye. Are you going to reconsider if the guy comes to Washington and make his case?\n\nMR PRICE: So the position weve put forward when it comes to potential normalization with the Assad regime is not a position that is particular or unique to any single country. It applies across the board. We have made clear that we will not normalize and we do not support other countries normalizing with the Assad regime.\n\nWe have made that point repeatedly because we have not seen that this regime in Damascus has done anything that would merit normalization or merit improved relations. And we make that statement after 12 years of a brutal civil war in which the Syrian people have borne the brunt of that in many cases. In most cases, they have borne the toll of that war because of the very actions of the Assad regime.\n\nWe continue to support a Syrian-led political resolution in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and we remain firm. Anyone engaging with the regime should ask how that engagement is benefiting the Syrian people again, a people that have borne the vicious brunt of what their own government has inflicted upon them and how that engagement might contribute or, quite the opposite, to the fulfillment of UN Security Council Resolution 2254.\n\nTo the subtext of your question, I think its important that our messages are consistent. What we say in public is consistent with what we say in private; what we say in the abstract is consistent with what we say in specific circumstances. So again, if our partners, if our allies, ask us our thoughts on engagement with the regime, that will consistently be our answer.\n\nQUESTION: So why this contrast between you and your allies? The UAE foreign minister visited last week Damascus, and the Trkish foreign minister he will meet his counterpart. So how do you explain this contrast between you and your ally over Syria?\n\nMR PRICE: I can only speak for the United States of America. This is our position. This is our belief. It is predicated on the interests and the values that we have and that, by the way, we do happen to share with many of our partners and many of our allies. Its no secret that we sometimes do have disagreements with partners, with allies. When we do have those divergences of opinion, we talk about those. We use the predicate of deep and longstanding relations to share candid views, and this is one area where we have had some candid discussions with partners and with allies.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, can I\n\nMR PRICE: Let me move around to people who havent yes.\n\nQUESTION: A follow-up on that?\n\nMR PRICE: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: If the administration is concerned by normalization, why hasnt it made better use of the Caesar Act, which is designed at least in part to isolate the Syrian Government?\n\nMR PRICE: We remain focused on putting pressure on the Assad regime and those around him by working with the international community to hold the brutal dictator and his regime to account for the atrocities that they have perpetrated on their own people. Some of these atrocities amount to war crimes. Some of these atrocities amount to crimes against humanity as well.\n\nAll of our sanctions, including under the Caesar Act, remain fully in force. Theyre an important tool to press the case for accountability for the Assad regime. And just to the point I was making earlier, we are always looking for additional ways we can promote accountability through, in this case, the Caesar Act or other tools or authorities under or at our disposal.\n\nIf and when we find appropriate avenues to levy those consequences, we have not hesitated to do so and we will not hesitate to do so.\n\nQUESTION: Since you are you are in the region, do you have any comment on the Iranian foreign minister three days visit to Beirut starting today?\n\nMR PRICE: I dont. I would refer you to the Lebanese Government or the Iranian Government.\n\nQUESTION: Second, on the presidential elections, is the U.S. playing any role with France or others to press the leaders there to elect a new president?\n\nMR PRICE: This is a question that is best addressed to the Lebanese parliament. It is up to the Lebanese parliament to determine the next president in accordance with the Lebanese constitution and importantly the demands of the Lebanese people who continue to face multiple crises that are not of their own making. We call on Lebanons leaders to quickly select a president and to subsequently form a government. The Lebanese people deserve political leadership willing to put the interests of the country first and a government able to implement long-overdue reforms that are critical to unlocking crucial international support.\n\nQUESTION: I have one more on Syria. Is the U.S. playing any role in the reconciliation between SDF and the Syrian opposition?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, I wouldnt want to weigh in on what would constitute a hypothetical, but broadly speaking we seek to promote an inclusive political dialogue that advances the will of the Syrian people and thats in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254.\n\nLet me yes, I havent taken your question. Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Islamic Republic of Iran is sending warships to Panama Canal. Do you have any reactions to that? Do you find it provocative?\n\nMR PRICE: We are aware of this claim by Irans navy. We continue to monitor Irans attempts or at least its statements of its intent to develop a military presence in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nQUESTION: And also one more about exporting arms to Russia. There are reports that Iran has delayed the delivery of arms to Russia, including ballistic missiles and launchers. Are you aware of these delays and these reports, and whats your assessment?\n\nMR PRICE: Our overarching assessment has not changed. Iran is and remains Russias most important source of security assistance. This is a burgeoning partnership between Russia and Iran that has deepened in recent months but even over the longer time horizon. Weve released significant detail regarding the provision of UAV technology from Iran to Russia. We have also detailed our concerns that Russia may also seek ballistic missiles, ballistic missile technology, that Iran has.\n\nWe are watching very carefully. We continue to speak out against the provision of these wares, knowing that this technology, despite what we might hear from Tehran or from Moscow, is intended to do one thing: it is intended to kill Ukrainians; it is intended to inflict damage on the country of Ukraine, targeting in many cases civilian infrastructure.\n\nYes, I havent taken your question. Yes.\n\nQUESTION: On the U.S.-Japan 2+2 meeting yesterday. At the joint press conference, Secretary Blinken said that they had first formal dialogue on extended deterrence in 2+2 format. Does it mean from now on U.S. and Japan will regularly discuss about extended deterrence not only in working-level meetings but also in ministerial level?\n\nMR PRICE: We are committed to extended deterrence. It is a solemn commitment we have to our treaty allies in the Indo-Pacific. We are committed to it in the case of Japan. We are committed to it in the case of our ROK allies as well. There was a discussion of it yesterday, the critical role it plays in preserving peace and stability in the region, of reinforcing the rules-based international order. And I would expect there will be additional discussions of extended deterrence at multiple levels going forward with our Japanese allies.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Just a follow-up on when you talk about the invocation of Article V, do you have anything to exemplify on what kind of attack could lead to the invocation? Could it be the attack on satellite operated by Japan in the space or in\n\nMR PRICE: So the understanding that was announced yesterday was an understanding with Japan on how attacks to, from, or through space could be covered by Article V of the Japan-U.S. mutual defense treaty. In the instance of such an attack, this will be a topic of consultation and discussion with our Japanese allies to determine the applicability under Article V of the U.S.-Japan mutual defense treaty and to respond appropriately.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, just want to ask about whats been happening between Trkiye and Sweden over the past couple of days. And today specifically, Swedish ambassador was summoned after there was this demonstration with that puppet of Erdoan being hanged by the city wall in Stockholm. So does this kind of these kinds of developments, does this give you guys additional concern that the already delayed membership of Sweden and Finland will be further delayed? What is the timeline that youre looking at right now?\n\nMR PRICE: The timeline that we are looking is as soon as possible. And\n\nQUESTION: Its not I mean, sorry to interrupt you, but its just not realistic, and I think you guys know that as well. So I mean, are you more concerned over this latest incident and lets say you guys are now angling for after Trkiyes elections?\n\nMR PRICE: So as soon as possible is, in fact, realistic. Thats what were aiming for. Of course, we know the steps that have to be taken. This is an admission that can only take place with consensus on the part of the 30 current NATO Allies. But weve made the point consistently that Finland and Sweden are ready to be NATO allies. They are members of Partnership for Peace, other NATO structures. Their militaries already work seamlessly with our military. And we are and we remain very confident that NATO will formally welcome Finland and Sweden at the first opportunity.\n\nWe believe that the time is right to finalize their accession process and to welcome them as full members, and we say that knowing that it will enhance their security as NATO allies, as well as that of the Euro-Atlantic region. And we say that not as a disinterested party. Its very much in our national security interest as well. We are and will remain committed to their accession. You can see the strength of our support for their NATO membership in the overwhelmingly in the overwhelming bipartisan vote that took place last year in the U.S. Senate just weeks after their application was first submitted.\n\nIn all of this, weve acknowledged the very legitimate security concerns on the part of Trkiye. We appreciate the tangible actions Finland and Sweden have already taken to address those concerns, as committed to under the trilateral memorandum of understanding that Trkiye signed on the margins of the NATO Summit in Madrid in June with Finland and Sweden, including substantially strengthening their bilateral cooperation with Trkiye on key security concerns.\n\nQUESTION: When you say the time is now and as soon as possible, does that also mean that it is the U.S. assessment that Sweden and Finland has so far fulfilled what they need to do under that memorandum thats signed in Madrid?\n\nMR PRICE: That memorandum that was signed in Madrid was signed between Trkiye, Finland, and Sweden.\n\nQUESTION: Sure. But the U.S. can have an assessment on whether or not the conditions there are fulfilled. You can have an assessment on that.\n\nMR PRICE: And we very much appreciate the tangible actions that both countries have already taken to address those concerns. Ultimately, this was a roadmap for Trkiye, Finland, and Sweden to reach the point of accession, and this will be a question for those three countries, even as the United States continues to be very clear that we support their accession as soon as possible. They are ready to be NATO Allies, and we look forward to soon welcoming them as NATO Allies.\n\nYes, Dylan.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, back on Japan for one second. I want to go back to something the Secretary said a few weeks ago in this room, actually. He made a comment that if the U.S. were still in Afghanistan the way it was before, providing all the assistance it has to Ukraine would be, in his words, \"much more complicated.\" So in meetings like yesterdays with your Japanese allies, how are you explaining, given that sentiment, that the U.S. can handle issues like Ukraine at the same time as a potential conflict over Taiwan or other Chinese aggression in the region.\n\nMR PRICE: The Secretary was making the broad point, as we do firmly believe, that the investment that the American people, that the United States, and, as was predominately the case, the U.S. military made in Afghanistan over the course of 20 years was a significant drain on national resources. And you can measure those resources in any number of ways. You can measure it in the thousands of lives lost, the tens of thousands who were injured over the course of that 20-year military engagement. You can measure it in terms of the hundreds of billions of dollars that the United States expended in Afghanistan over the years. You can measure it in terms of what NATO committed and what NATO ultimately sacrificed in the course of that 20-year mission in Afghanistan.\n\nSo the point is that these are not typically either/or decisions. The point is that NATO now is more is better resourced, it is stronger, it is more purposeful than it has been since any time since the end of the Cold War. The transatlantic community is more resolute, more determined, more united than at any time since the end of the Cold War. The resources that the U.S. military, the resources in terms of personnel and funding that NATO and ISAF were expending on Afghanistan those are now able to be redirected to the challenges and the opportunities that we face today.\n\nWe say all of that knowing that the totality of our mission, of course, never ended in Afghanistan. We have a commitment to those with whom we served over the course of that 20-year engagement with Afghanistan, in Afghanistan. We have a broader commitment to the Afghan people. We can continue to do everything that we can to protect and to promote their interests, to mitigate the dire humanitarian circumstances that have been inflicted upon them, just as we are better able to take on the challenge that Russia presents and challenges but also opportunities that have emerged, that may emerge, whether thats in Europe, whether thats in the Indo-Pacific, whether thats anywhere in between.\n\nQUESTION: So youre telling Japan, for instance, that the resource drain of having a few thousand troops in Afghanistan would be prohibitive, potentially, to aiding Ukraine as much as you would like, but the resource drain of a conflict in Taiwan or something like that is not?\n\nMR PRICE: Thats not our message. We can take apart the each element of that argument, but Dylan, what we were talking about was really a binary option when it came to Afghanistan: an open-ended, accelerated military engagement in Afghanistan that would not have constituted 2,500 troops. The point that you heard from this administration and from outside experts was the fact that the status quo in Afghanistan, as this administration inherited it in January of 2021, with the fewest number of troops in Afghanistan since the earliest days of the war, was not sustainable. The question was withdrawal or deeper engagement and by deeper engagement, more forces, more potentially American blood, more American treasure.\n\nPresident Biden, as three successors excuse me, three predecessors before him had, came to the determination that it was time for American forces to withdraw militarily from Afghanistan. President Biden uniquely was in a position to follow through with that commitment. So again, this is not a question of either-or. The United States of America, the American military, is capable of doing extraordinary feats, taking on extraordinary missions, oftentimes simultaneously plan for that, exercise for that, develop all sorts of contingencies for that.\n\nBut if the question was should we subject hundreds or thousands more American forces and millions or billions of additional American dollars each and every year to Afghanistan, a theater where our the goals the United States went in with and the goals the international community went in with in October of 2001, where those goals had been met again, due in no small part to the U.S. military, to our diplomatic engagement, to our government, to our partners within the U.S. Government, but also to our partners in NATO and partners around the world if the question was do we deepen that investment or do we finally affect that withdrawal after having completed the mission that the international community went in to pursue, President Biden made the determination the right determination, we are confident that it was time finally to end that mission.\n\nYes, Alex.\n\nQUESTION: And the (inaudible) initiative Without Just Cause, Im just trying to figure out how is it going to differ from what recently that you have already been doing. According to the readout, the initiative will include diplomatic engagement and public diplomacy. Im just wondering if naming and shaming or quote/unquote \"engagement\" will be prioritized. And whos going to run the show DRL, or?\n\nMR PRICE: So the answer to your first question is a little bit of both. This is an effort to shine a bright light, to shine a spotlight on a challenge that we face around the world of political prisoners, people who are held without just cause, people who are held because of their beliefs, because of their protected activities, because in the eyes of a government or a regime they pose a threat. To us thats unacceptable, and the Without Just Cause campaign is one tactic.\n\nThe individuals who are highlighted as part of that campaign, of course and unfortunately, are not the totality of political prisoners around the world. Those number in the thousands. What were talking about here is a small microcosm of the challenge of political prisoners. That is an effort that DRL in this case is running to put a spotlight on that, to raise public awareness, and to emphasize to countries around the world that this is a challenge that the United States will do everything we can to address and, on a case-by-case basis, resolve.\n\nQUESTION: Giving a timeline until, lets say, next year you want those individuals to be released?\n\nMR PRICE: We want those individuals to be released today. We want those individuals to be released tomorrow. We are going to continue working, as we consistently have, to see all of those individuals, but political prisoners around the world, to see to it that they are not held without just cause.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. And lastly, a separate topic. Armenia has refused to host Russia-led military drills. Previously, also we heard Armenian officials were talking about how Russia is trying to lure them into Belarus-Russia coalition. Is it what your impression that Russia is trying to do in the South Caucasus? Ive heard similar arguments in Azerbaijan as well.\n\nMR PRICE: I would refer you to the Government of Armenia to speak to their position on this.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, do you guys have any reaction or response to this Oxfam report that came out yesterday about the U.S. and UK weapons being used by the Saudis to well, killing civilians in Yemen?\n\nMR PRICE: Yes. Yeah. So on that report, Oxfams recent report covered a period predating the UN-mediated truce in Yemen that began in April of last year, and for which the major elements remain in place. The dramatic reduction of violence since April of last year, enabled by U.S. diplomacy, has saved countless lives and helped avert a famine. International humanitarian law, including rules related to the protection of civilians, must always be respected in armed conflict. We will continue to support improvements to our partners abilities to mitigate and respond to civilian harm, including through pressing for accountability when that is appropriate.\n\nThe United States is committed to seeking a mandate in the UN Human Rights Council to advance accountability, justice, and redress for the human rights abuses and violations that have occurred during the conflict in Yemen.\n\nQUESTION: So you dont think that this has continued on after the truce began?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, the simple fact is that with the introduction of the truce in April of 2022, there was a dramatic reduction in violence. Much of the activity that is cited in the report activity that according to this report is alleged to have resulted in some cases in civilian harm much of that activity either was reduced or came to an end entirely.\n\nYes, final question.\n\nQUESTION: Thanks. So on Assad, normalizing relations with Assad, we have you mentioned values, sanctions, actions of the United States. Could you tell us to any of this over the course of 11 years have changed Assads course of action in a minimal way even?\n\nMR PRICE: So counterfactuals are always impossible to entertain. I wont try to entertain this one except to make the broad point that Assad has perpetrated atrocities against his own people. He has his forces have conducted crimes against humanity. They have conducted war crimes as well. We of course dont know what the Assad regime might have done would it not have been for the accountability measures that have been imposed on him. We do not know what the Assad regime might have done had it not been for the actions on the part of the United States and countries around the world to confiscate and destroy Syrias chemical weapons stockpiles in the aftermath of 2014. All of that is unknowable.\n\nWhat we know is that we are going to continue to promote accountability for the Assad regime. We are going to continue to discourage partners around the world from normalizing or improving relations with the Assad regime. And were going to continue espousing the principles that are at the heart of UN Security Council Resolution 2254. We continue to believe that it forms the most appropriate basis for bringing the civil war to an end in a way that is durable, in a way that respects and promotes the aspirations of the Syrian people.\n\nQUESTION: But the question the question is it doesnt none of this changed the course of the war, and United States is not for does not have a policy of regime change in Syria. Atrocities continue. People are suffering. What is the way out?\n\nMR PRICE: The way out, as we see it, is through UN Security Council Resolution 2254. I dont want to give you the impression that anyone is complacent or anyone is satisfied with the course of the past 12 years of the civil war in Syria. Quite the opposite. It is an absolute tragedy, it is a manmade tragedy, a tragedy thats been inflicted on the people of Syria by Bashar al-Assad, by his regime.\n\nNow, I cant speak to what might have transpired had the United States and the international community not taken the steps we have to hold the Assad regime to account. But what I can say is we will continue to take steps to promote that vision thats put forward in UN Security Council Resolution 2254.\n\nThank you all very much.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\n(The briefing was concluded at 3:29 p.m.)\n\n# # #",

                "cc_text": "UNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL ROSEMARY A. DICARLOS\n\nREMARKS TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON\n\nUKRAINE\n\nNew York, 13 January 2023\n\nMr. President,\n\nThe war in Ukraine is approaching its one-year anniversary, with no end in sight to the fighting or the suffering.\n\nThroughout the holiday season, the forces of the Russian Federation continued their strikes on key Ukrainian cities. Too many Ukrainians spent what is normally a festive period in bomb shelters. Far from celebrating, countless families across the country were mourning the loss of loved ones.\n\nOn the morning of 29 December, Russian forces launched more Ukraine-wide attacks targeting regions including Dnipro, Kherson, Kirovohrad, and Kyiv. Multiple strikes were reported in the cites of Kharkiv, Odesa, Lviv, Zhytomyr, as well as Kyiv.\n\nTwo days later, on New Years Eve, Ukraine's all administrative regions were again under air raid warnings.\n\nThe attacks have continued in the new year despite the announcement of a possible cessation of hostilities over Orthodox Christmas, a holy period for both Russians and Ukrainians.\n\nOn 6 January, an emergency worker was killed in an attack on a fire station in the city of Kherson. The next day, several regions in the east and south of Ukraine were shelled.\n\nGround fighting has intensified, especially in the Donetsk region. In areas of active hostilities such as Bakhmut and Soledar, relentless battles, including street fighting, pose a great threat to the remaining civilian population.\n\nIn Bakhmut alone, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has documented 22 civilians killed and 72 injured since early December.\n\nFollowing the most recent fighting, OHCHR has verified 18,096 civilian casualties since Russias invasion of 24 February 2022. This total includes 6,952 people killed and 11,144 injured. The actual figures are likely considerably higher.\n\nMr. President,\n\nThe war has forced millions to flee their homes. We commend the generosity of the countries hosting some 7.9 million people who sought protection in Europe. We encourage further efforts to ensure equitable access to rights and services for refugees in national systems.\n\nIn Ukraine some 5.91 million people, 65 per cent of them women and girls, are internally displaced.\n\nFuelling the displacement is the purposeful, systematic targeting of critical civilian infrastructure, including energy and healthcare facilities.\n\nFollowing a request from Ukraine to the Secretary General, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has launched a sector-specific damage assessment in collaboration with the World Bank.\n\nThe assessment, which aims at identifying the most critical needs for restoration of damaged energy infrastructure, is currently underway, with 90 per cent of the data collection completed.\n\nThe number of recorded attacks on healthcare facilities last year was the highest in the world. There were 745 incidents as of 4 January.\n\nIn the most affected regions in the east and south of the country, reportedly 15 per cent of facilities are either partially or completely non-functional, and up to 50 per cent in Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv.\n\nMr. President,\n\nInevitably, the war is also leaving invisible scars. According to the World Health Organization, nearly a quarter of the population is reportedly at risk of developing a mental health condition because of this war.\n\nThe destruction and closing of schools will also have a lasting impact on children and young people. An estimated 5.7 million school-aged children have been directly affected, including 3.6 million due to the closure of educational institutions early in the conflict.\n\nIn recent months, aid organizations have continued efforts to expand life-saving operations to previously inaccessible areas, including in Kharkiv and Kherson regions.\n\nAs of 5 January, humanitarian partners have provided food to almost 9 million people. The same number of people have received critical healthcare support across the country.\n\nAround 7.3 million people have been assisted with access to clean water and hygiene products. Over 3 million people uprooted by the war or those whose houses have been damaged have received emergency shelter or critical household items.\n\nIn response to the energy crisis, humanitarian partners have distributed hundreds of generators to make sure critical services like hospitals and schools, as well as centres hosting those displaced, can continue operating.\n\nIn all, since 24 February of last year almost 14 million people have received assistance from over 740 partners. This includes 1 million people in areas not under the control of the Government of Ukraine.\n\nBut the humanitarian response is hampered by severe access constraints, particularly in areas in the east under Russian control. In line with international humanitarian law, parties must facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for all civilians in need.\n\nMr. President,\n\nOHCHR continues to document allegations of grave human rights violations and to support efforts towards accountability.\n\nSince 24 February, OHCHR has documented over 90 cases of conflict-related sexual violence, falling into two categories:\n\nthe majority as a method of torture and ill-treatment in detention, predominantly affecting men;\n\nand sexual violence involving rape, including gang rape, of women and girls in areas under Russian control.\n\nIt is imperative that all perpetrators of human rights violations are held accountable.\n\nOn the question of accountability, the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court continues its work in Ukraine, where it has maintained a presence since May 2022.\n\nAs the Prosecutor has indicated in his briefings to the Council, the alleged targeting of civilian objects and the unlawful transfer and deportation of civilians, including children, from Ukraine to the Russian Federation, are the investigative priorities of his Office.\n\nMr. President,\n\nOn a positive note, we welcome the ongoing contacts and commitment of the parties to continue exchanges of prisoners of war, most recently on Sunday involving 50 Ukrainian and 50 Russian captives.\n\nWe are encouraged by the meeting hosted in Trkiye on 11 January between the Russian and Ukrainian ombudspersons on this issue.\n\nDespite the challenging context, the Black Sea Grain Initiative continues to make a difference, including by helping bring global food prices down. The Food and Agriculture Organization now reports a continued decline of its Food Price Index.\n\nMore than 17 million metric tons of foodstuffs have now been moved under the Initiative, reaching, or on the way to, some 43 countries.\n\nRoughly 20 per cent of this total is for countries categorized by the World Bank as low-income or lower-middle-income economies.\n\nThe United Nations also continues its engagement with all stakeholders to remove remaining obstacles to Russian food and fertilizer exports, including ammonia. These exports are key to keep prices down and mitigate food insecurity, and we urge all concerned to work to that end.\n\nMr. President,\n\nAs the Secretary-General has made clear, Russias invasion of Ukraine is a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law.\n\nIt has created a humanitarian and human rights catastrophe, traumatized a generation of children, and accelerated the global food and energy crises. And yet, this grave damage could pale in comparison with the consequences of a prolonged conflict.\n\nI said at the outset of my statement that there is no sign of an end to the fighting. The logic that prevails is a military one, with very little, if any, room for dialogue right now.\n\nBut all wars end, and so too will this one. Ukraine, Russia, the world cannot afford for this war to continue. The Secretary-General is ready to assist the parties to end this senseless, unjustified conflict, on the basis of the United Nations Charter and international law.\n\nThank you, Mr. President",

The attack not only caused significant loss of life, including a 15-year-old girl, but also trapped others under the rubble of the destroyed building (1,2,3). Despite the devastation, the reason behind the targeting of this residential building remains unclear. Officials have not provided information on why the building was hit, as it was located some distance from the nearest power facility, which suggests that it may not have been the intended target. This has led to speculations that the missile could have been one of the less accurate ones in Russia's arsenal or possibly intercepted by Ukraine's air defenses, although the latter seems less likely (5).\n\nThe missile strike in Dnipro occurred amid wider attacks across Ukraine, with infrastructure facilities also hit in the western Lviv region, Ivano-Frankivsk regions, the Odesa region on the Black Sea, northeastern Kharkiv, and the capital Kyiv (2,8). The widespread assault on Ukraine's energy grid and other critical infrastructure has been a persistent strategy, with Russia launching waves of drone and missile attacks since New Year's Eve, mainly targeting these critical services. The attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure, which have cast cities into darkness and cold, are claimed by Moscow to be aimed at reducing Ukraine's ability to fight, while Kyiv decries them as having no military purpose and accuses Russia of intending to harm civilians, a war crime (7,10)."

The attack has intensified the humanitarian crisis in the region, with ongoing rescue operations to recover survivors from the rubble, as 38 individuals, including six children, have been rescued so far (4,6). The targeting of civilian infrastructure, seemingly distant from any military facilities, raises questions about the precision and intent behind the strike, particularly as it occurred during a period when Russia appeared to renew its focus on disrupting Ukraine's energy grid (6).\n\nEvacuation and humanitarian efforts in other areas, such as Soledar and Bakhmut, continue despite the intensifying conflict, with Ukrainian officials struggling to evacuate hundreds of trapped civilians amidst some of the bloodiest fighting of the war (7). The persistence of the conflict and the targeting of civilian areas by missile strikes have not only compounded the difficulties faced by rescue and aid workers but have also highlighted the indiscriminate nature of the attacks, which Ukrainian officials argue have no military purpose and are intended to harm civilians (5,7). The relentless assaults on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and civilian buildings underscore the dire need for ongoing humanitarian assistance and evacuation operations in the affected regions (5,7)."

The Battle of Verdun was the longest battle of the first world war, and led to huge casualties. Yermak said: The situation is difficult, even very difficult. This is the battle of Verdun in the 21st century. The fighting has been going on for several months, but our fighters manage to hold their positions. The Russians release criminals from prisons who die as soon as they reach the frontline. Their bodies are left in place, they are not even removed, there are many human losses on the Russian side, much more than ours. We clearly value the lives of our soldiers more. But before us is a human mass that is constantly attacking, attacking, attacking. Soledar is a place of street battles, wherever one of the parties does not control the city. The Russians are there, but they do not control the city. The situation is complicated, but our goal is to liberate our territories, fully restore the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\n\nUpdated at 08.22 EST\n\n13 Jan 2023 13.46 EST Summary Here is a summary of the latest developments in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as we close the blog for today: Ukraine has denied Russias claim that Putins forces have captured Soledar. On Friday, as Russias defence ministry said its forces had taken full control of the salt mining town. Ukrainian officials denied the Russian claim, suggesting they were still holding on and counterattacking, with the Ukrainian military spokesperson Serhii Cherevatyi reporting \"ongoing battles\".\n\nSoledar is Verdun for 21st century according to a top Ukraine official. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the president of Ukraine, likened the fight for the town to the longest and bloodiest battle in the first world war.\n\nUkraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces defending Bakhmut and Soledar in the east would be armed with everything they need to keep Russian troops at bay in some of the bloodiest fighting of the war.\n\nHundreds of civilians remain trapped in Soledar, Ukraine has said . Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk, told Ukrainian state TV that 559 civilians remained in Soledar, including 15 children, and could not be evacuated.\n\nSatellite images taken by Maxar Technologies show the destruction inflicted upon Soledar. The Guardian has a series of striking images from inside the eastern Ukrainian town.\n\nUkraine is confident Britain will announce it plans to send about 10 Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv shortly , a move it hopes will help Germany finally allow its Leopard 2s to be re-exported to the embattled country. A formal announcement is anticipated on Monday but Ukrainian sources indicated they understood that Britain had already decided in favour.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putins move to replace his top commander in Ukraine after a few months is a sign of military disarray and his growing impatience in a war Russia is not winning , analysts said. The defence ministry in Moscow said Wednesday it had, again, replaced its top commander in Ukraine, putting army chief of staff Valery Gerasimov in charge. It is the latest of several major shake-ups of Moscows military leadership.\n\nGermany will continue to \"weigh every step carefully\" and consult with its allies on further weapons deliveries to Ukraine, chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. The German leader is facing mounting pressure to approve German-made battle tanks for Kyiv. Scholz said Berlin would keep its \"leading position\" as one of Kyivs top supporters but said he had no intention of being rushed on \"such serious things that have to do with peace and war, with the security of our country and of Europe\".\n\nA US envoy has called for Serbia to sign on to sanctions against Russia. Counselor Derek Chollet expressed strong concern on Thursday about the activities of the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group and its alleged attempts to recruit soldiers in Serbia and elsewhere in the world.\n\nA former Russian deputy minister of defence has suggested the country could increase the upper age limit for conscription from 27 to 30 for this years spring draft campaign . Andrey Kartapolov, the head of the State Duma defence committee, suggested the change could take place without altering the lower bar for conscription of 18 years.\n\nA US navy veteran has been released after almost a year in Russian detention, according to his family. Taylor Dudley, 35, of Michigan, was taken into custody by Russian border police last April after crossing the border from Poland into Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier has had successful surgery to remove an unexploded grenade from his chest, senior officials in Kyiv have said. Surgeons removed the weapon from just beneath the heart of the injured serviceman, while two sappers ensured the operation was conducted safely, said Hanna Maliar, Ukraines deputy minister of defence.\n\nUpdated at 13.56 EST\n\n13 Jan 2023 12.53 EST In comments issued through his press service on Friday, and apparently aimed at Russias defence establishment, Yevgeny Prigozhin the head of Russias Wagner mercenary group complained about \"infighting, corruption, bureaucracy and officials who want to stay in their positions\" and what he called constant attempts to \"steal victory\" from his organisation. Prigozhin, who has harshly criticised the failings of the regular army, issued a premature claim earlier this week that Soledar had already fallen, and said the fighting there was exclusively being waged by his men the Wagner mercenary group. Ukraine has denied Russian forces have seized control of Soledar and said its forces were holding out. In response to Prigozhin, Russias defence ministry late on Friday issued a second statement seeking \"to clarify\" the situation and acknowledging the role of the Wagner group fighters in Soledar. \"As for the direct storming of Soledars city quarters occupied by the armed forces of Ukraine, this combat task was successfully accomplished by the courageous and selfless actions of volunteers from the Wagner assault detachments,\" it said.\n\nUpdated at 13.12 EST\n\n13 Jan 2023 11.59 EST Burst riverbanks, thick mud and waterlogged fields could be seen for miles around north-west Ukraines border with Belarus on Thursday, making the prospect of a Russian assault from across the border unlikely for now, despite recent warnings from Kyiv. On the sidelines of training exercises several kilometres south of the Russian border, soldiers from the unit based there told Reuters how the unusually mild winter had given them a considerable tactical advantage. The units spokesman, Serhiy Khominskyi, said that help in making the terrain unpassable had also come from an unlikely ally: the local beaver population. \"When they build their dams, normally people destroy them, but they didnt this year because of the war, so now there is water everywhere,\" he said. A sign warning of mines in front of an anti-tank construction near the border with Belarus in the Volyn region. Photograph: Gleb Garanich/Reuters Analyst Konrad Muzyka, who runs the defence consultancy Rochan Consulting, told Reuters that although a Russian troop buildup could be observed in Belarus, an attack into north-west Ukraine from Belarus would face enormous difficulties. \"Its a horrible place to conduct an offensive operation. There are many watercourses there, very few roads,\" he said. \"This makes it easy for Ukrainian forces to channel the movement of Russian forces into specific areas where they would be shelled by artillery.\"\n\nUpdated at 12.12 EST\n\n13 Jan 2023 11.22 EST Germany will continue to \"weigh every step carefully\" and consult with its allies on further weapons deliveries to Ukraine, chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. The German leader is facing mounting pressure to approve German-made battle tanks for Kyiv. Germany has given Ukraine substantial military aid since Russia invaded, including howitzers, Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns and the first of four Iris-T surface-to-air missile systems. Last week, it announced that it would send 40 Marder armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine and a Patriot air defence missile battery. But critics have long complained of Scholzs perceived hesitancy to take the next step on weapons deliveries. On Friday, Scholz said Berlin would keep its \"leading position\" as one of Kyivs top supporters but he signalled he had no intention of being rushed on \"such serious things that have to do with peace and war, with the security of our country and of Europe\".\n\nUpdated at 11.35 EST\n\n13 Jan 2023 10.46 EST Russia is becoming too dependent on oil revenues to support its budget as it ramps up military spending, economists have said, warning the government may have to raise taxes if prices of crude fail to meet expectations this year. The price of Urals oil URL-E, which is Russias main export, has plunged more than 20% since early December, when western nations led by the G7 imposed a $60 price cap on Russian oil exports to restrict Moscows ability to finance what it calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. Given that the 2023 federal budget is based on a projected Urals price of just over $70 a barrel, and prices are currently trading closer to $50, this could prove problematic, Reuters reports. As the price cap, western sanctions and EU embargo make it harder for Russia to export oil, Moscow has relied on China and India the worlds largest and third-largest importers, respectively to fill the gap.\n\nUpdated at 11.03 EST\n\n13 Jan 2023 10.34 EST A funeral service for the Ukrainian volunteer soldier Denys Halushko, who was killed while fighting near Bakhmut, Donetsk region.

His piece features some shocking before-and-after photos of the area showing the vast devastation caused by the conflict. While the situation on the battlefield remained difficult to verify on Friday, by the weeks end, geolocation of reports by Russian war correspondents from Soledar suggested Russian forces were in control of large parts of the town. Ukrainian forces, however, appeared to remain within Soledars municipal boundaries still fighting in the north-west, around the towns salt mine and railway junction. Crucially, Ukraine still appears to control the road beyond the town, connecting neighbouring Bakhmut and Soledar with Sloviansk and Kostyantynivka, whose capture would further threaten Ukrainian defenders in Bakhmut. What is clear is that the battle for Soledar and Bakhmut has become emblematic of the current state of the war on Ukraines eastern front, and more widely symbolic of the state of Moscows offensive.

A formal announcement is anticipated on Monday, but Ukrainian sources indicated they understood that Britain had already decided in favour, as pressure mounts on Berlin ahead of a meeting of western defence ministers next Friday. Earlier this week, it emerged that Britain was considering supplying Ukraine with the tanks following months of requests from Kyiv with a final decision in the hands of the prime minister, Rishi Sunak. A handful of Challenger 2 tanks, taken from the UKs existing fleet of 227, would not in itself make much difference on the battlefield, but it would be the first time any western country has agreed to send its own heavy armour to Ukraine. Ukraine confident UK will send Challenger 2 tanks to help war effort Read more\n\nUpdated at 10.22 EST\n\n13 Jan 2023 09.47 EST A Ukrainian soldier stationed in the eastern city of Bakhmut has told CNN that Ukrainian units are still at the edges of Soledar. Taras Berezovets, a captain in the Ukrainian Special Forces First Brigade, said paratroopers from 77th and 46th brigades were still on the western outskirts of Soledar. He said remaining in Soledar made no military sense, because it was \"completely destroyed. There is no single building which survived Russian shelling.\" He added that he expected a decision to withdraw in the coming days. Now, he said, the units see their mission as holding on as long as possible and killing as many mercenary Wagner fighters as possible. He said much of the fighting over the last two weeks had involved street fighting in Soledar between small units of four to eight fighters. Berezovets said he believed withdrawing from Soledar would not affect the ability of Ukrainian forces to resupply Bakhmut, a few kilometres to the south-west. He said two major roads into Bakhmut remained in Ukrainian hands, and Ukrainian fighter jets had been attacking Russian positions near Bakhmut during Friday.\n\nUpdated at 10.04 EST",

All times EST.\n\n10:06 p.m.: A U.S. commitment to supply Kyiv with Bradley Fighting Vehicles for the first time is exactly what Ukraine needs, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, Reuters reported, quoting his video address Friday.\n\nZelenskyy said the formal announcement showed that his visit to Washington last month had produced concrete results. The weapons are part of a new $3 billion U.S. weapons aid package for Ukraine that is set to be announced later Friday.\n\n\"For the first time we will receive Bradley armored vehicles this is exactly what is needed,\" Zelenskyy said, thanking U.S. President Joe Biden and the U.S. Congress.\n\nZelenskyy thanked Germany, which will send Marder Infantry Fighting Vehicles and a Patriot air defense.\n\n9:39 p.m.: The Ukrainian government has taken the main cathedral of the revered historic monastery from the church previously affiliated with Moscow's patriarchate and allowed its Ukrainian rival to use it for Orthodox Christmas services, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe move comes as the long-running tensions between the two churches exacerbated amid Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian Minister of Culture Oleksandr Tkachenko said Thursday that the Dormition Cathedral and the Refectory Church of the nearly 1,000-year-old Pechersk Lavra also known as Monastery of the Caves in the Ukrainian capital have been taken over by the state after the lease held by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) expired on December 31.\n\nOn Friday, Tkachenko said that the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) the similarly named rival church asked for and was granted permission to conduct the service at the cathedral on Saturday when Orthodox Christmas is celebrated.\n\nIn 2019, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine received recognition from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Moscow's and most other Orthodox patriarchs refused to accept that designation that formalized a split with the Russian church.\n\n8:53 p.m.: Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich's seven children became the beneficiaries of 10 offshore trusts holding assets worth billions of dollars shortly before he was hit with sanctions, Britain's Guardian newspaper reported Friday.\n\nAbramovichs children acquired the beneficial ownership of the secretive trusts with assets of at least $4 billion in early February 2022, three weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine, the Guardian said. Western governments had threatened to sanction oligarchs in the event of an invasion.\n\nThe \"sweeping reorganization\" of his financial affairs is detailed in leaked files from a Cyprus-based offshore service provider administering the trusts, the newspaper said.\n\nAn anonymous source shared the \"large cache\" of documents dubbed \"the Oligarch files\" with the newspaper, it reported.\n\nThey show that Abramovich's children, five of whom are adults, with the youngest age 9, became the trusts' majority beneficial owners, including \"luxury properties and a fleet of superyachts, helicopters and private jets.\"\n\n8:03 p.m.: Ukrainian forces conducted a strike Thursday on a temporary base of Russian troops in Havrylivka Druha, a village in Kherson oblast near the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula, the General Staff of Ukraines Armed Forces reported Friday, according to The Kyiv Independent.\n\n\"Currently, it is known that up to 100 wounded (Russian) soldiers were brought to local hospitals,\" the General Staff said, adding that the number of killed Russian troops is being clarified.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, the Ukrainian Air Force struck a Russian personnel base, while Ukraines rocket and artillery forces hit two other Russian personnel and military equipment concentration areas over the past day, the General Staff said, without providing further details.\n\nEarlier on Jan. 5, the General Staff also said that Ukraine's forces launched 20 attacks on the areas of concentration of Russian troops.\n\n6:42 p.m.: In a flurry of announcements, some of Ukraine's major Western allies pledged this week to send advanced armored combat vehicles to help Kyiv in its fight against Russia's invasion.\n\nBut what's with all this new Westerns weaponry? Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.\n\n5:57 p.m.: A Kremlin-declared truce in fighting in Ukraine for Orthodox Christmas has been broken by exchanges of artillery fire along the front line, including in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, where one person was killed, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported, citing the head of the regional military administration.\n\nThe fire department in Kherson was shelled on January 6, said Yaroslav Yanushevych, who described the person killed as a firefighter and said four others were injured, including one who is in serious condition. All were hospitalized, he said, adding that a house near the fire station was damaged in the attack.\n\n\"Despite the fact that the rescuers themselves came under fire, they immediately set out to extinguish the blaze,\" Yanushevych said.\n\n5 p.m.: A U.S. commitment to supply Kyiv with Bradley Fighting Vehicles for the first time is exactly what Ukraine needs, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, Reuters reported, citing his video address on Friday.\n\nZelenskyy said the formal announcement showed his visit to Washington last month had produced concrete results. The weapons are part of a new $3 billion U.S. weapons aid package for Ukraine announced on Friday.\n\n\"For the first time we will receive Bradley armored vehicles - this is exactly what is needed,\" Zelenskyy said, thanking U.S. President Joe Biden and the U.S. Congress.\n\nZelenskyy also thanked Germany, which will send Marder Infantry Fighting Vehicles and a Patriot air-defense.\n\n\"So, as of now, there are more air defense systems, more armored vehicles, western tanks, which is a first, more cannons and shells ... and all this means more protection for Ukrainians and all Europeans against any kind of Russian terror,\" he said.\n\n4:15 p.m.: Worshippers in the eastern occupied Ukrainian town of Volnovakha on Friday marked the Russian Orthodox Christmas Eve in a makeshift chapel that was set up in a home after their church suffered shelling damage, Reuters reported.\n\nVera Barda, 74, said the congregation had initially met in a tent after the church was hit during what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine.\n\n\"I offered the priest (my place) saying there was a stove and electricity, so it was warmer than in a tent ... he agreed at once and in three weeks we restored everything,\" she said.\n\nDuring the service, carried out in a converted cramped room decked out in icons, an Orthodox priest dressed in a ceremonial white robe burned incense while the mainly elderly congregation prayed during the Eastern Orthodox liturgy.\n\n3:30 p.m.: President Vladimir Putin's aim of seizing Ukrainian territory has not changed, but Russian forces continue to suffer from military weaknesses including the number of troops they have, the Pentagon said on Friday.\n\n\"Putin has not given up his aims of dominating Ukraine and continuing to acquire Ukraine's territory,\" said Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of defense focusing on Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\"But the reality of Russian weaknesses, the Russian armed forces weaknesses has collided with those aims,\" Cooper said, adding that Russian troops also suffer from low morale.\n\nWashington hopes the latest record weapons package for Kyiv will help Ukraine retake territory occupied by Russia, Reuters reports.\n\n2:40 p.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday announced more than $3.075 billion in military assistance to Ukraine and countries affected by the Russian invasion.\n\nBlinken said in a statement that he is authorizing a drawdown of U.S. arms and equipment for Ukraine, which includes a $2.85 billion drawdown that will provide Ukraine with Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, artillery systems, armored personnel carriers, surface to air missiles, ammunition, and other items to support Ukraine.\n\n2:30 p.m.: The U.S. Department of Defense announced on Friday the Biden administrations commitment of $3.075 billion in additional security assistance for Ukraine.\n\nThe 29th Presidential Drawdown of equipment from Pentagon inventories for Ukraine includes:\n\n50 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles with 500 TOW anti-tank missiles and 250,000 rounds of 25mm ammunition;\n\n100 M113 Armored Personnel Carriers;\n\n55 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs);\n\n138 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs);\n\n18 155mm self-propelled Howitzers and 18 ammunition support vehicles;\n\n70,000 155mm artillery rounds;\n\n500 precision-guided 155mm artillery rounds;\n\n1,200 155mm rounds of Remote Anti-Armor Mine (RAAM) Systems;\n\n36 105mm towed Howitzers and 95,000 105mm artillery rounds;\n\n10,000 120mm mortar rounds;\n\nadditional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS);\n\nRIM-7 missiles for air defense;\n\n4,000 Zuni aircraft rockets;\n\nabout 2,000 anti-armor rockets;\n\nsniper rifles, machine guns, and ammunition for grenade launchers and small arms;\n\nClaymore anti-personnel munitions;\n\nnight vision devices and optics;\n\nspare parts and other field equipment.\n\n2:15 p.m.: At a White House briefing Friday, National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby told VOAs Iulia Yarmolenko that the timing for the biggest U.S. aid package to Ukraine to date was propelled by Ukraines ceaseless, ongoing fight to defend themselves against Russia.\n\n\"We did not expect the fighting to stop in the winter. It hasn't. In fact, in some places, it's become even more vicious. Donbas, particularly,\" he said. \"And so, we want to make sure that the Ukrainians are well kitted out and well suited for the fighting that they're going to be facing in the next couple of months.\"\n\nKirby said Ukrainians have been able to maintain an impressive level of readiness for what they're facing. He discussed US sending Bradley fighting vehicles to Ukraine.\n\n\"Obviously, we're talking about Bradleys today. But recently we've been talking about air defense capabilities and the innovative way in which they're using what is being provided to them. So, I think they never fail to surprise or impress with their ability to adapt in real time to the challenges that they're facing.\"\n\nKirby said it is \"really impressive\" to see is the way Ukrainians have modified not only their needs, but their abilities in the field to the fighting that they're facing.\n\n1:30 p.m.: The U.S. Department of Defense awarded L3Harris Technologies Inc LHX.N a $40 million contract to deliver 14 anti-drone weapon systems to bolster Ukraine's security forces, the defense contractor said on Friday.\n\nThe company said its Vehicle Agnostic Modular Palletized ISR Rocket Equipment (VAMPIRE) kit will allow Ukraine ground forces to target, shoot down enemy drones and defend against ground threats.\n\nUnder the contract, L3Harris will deliver four VAMPIRE units by mid-2023 and ten more by year-end.\n\nThe defense contractor will install the kits on U.S. government-provided vehicles for combat support to the Ukrainian battlefield.\n\nAdditionally, a new U.S. weapons aid package for Ukraine worth more than $3 billion is set to be announced later on Friday and will include Sea Sparrow missiles for air defense and Bradley Fighting Vehicles, according to a document seen by Reuters.\n\n12:15 p.m.: Ukraine will need at least $1.79 billion to restore its telecommunications sector to pre-war levels, a U.N. agency said in a report published on Friday alleging Russia had \"destroyed completely or seized\" networks in parts of the country, Reuters reports.\n\nThe damage assessment by the Geneva-based International Telecommunication Union (ITU) was commissioned in April to evaluate the extent of destruction of Ukraine's communication networks as a result of Russia's invasion last February.\n\nThe report, which covers the first six months of the war, found that there was considerable damage and destruction to communications infrastructure in more than 10 out of 24 regions of Ukraine.\n\n\"Since the beginning of military attacks, with the purpose of using the facilities in its interests and for its own needs, the aggressor either destroyed completely or seized the regular operation of public and private terrestrial telecommunication and critical infrastructure in the temporarily occupied and war-affected territories of Ukraine,\" the report said.\n\nIt also alleges that Moscow unilaterally switched Ukrainian dialing codes, fixed by the U.N. agency, to Russian ones and that there had been 1,123 cyber-attacks against Ukraine.\n\nAn official with the Russian diplomatic mission in Geneva dismissed the report's allegations, saying they were designed to divert attention from unspecified \"atrocities\" committed by Ukraine on Russian-occupied territory.\n\nThe foreign ministry in Moscow did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRussia has regularly targeted Ukraine with cyberattacks since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. These attacks, perpetrated against government and banking websites, intensified before Moscow sent troops into Ukraine last year. Russia has denied being behind those and other attacks.\n\n12:00 p.m.: The United States on Friday issued new sanctions targeting suppliers of Iranian drones that Washington said have been used to target civilian infrastructure in Ukraine during the conflict with Russia, Reuters reports.\n\nRussia has been targeting vital Ukraine infrastructure since October with droves of missiles and drones, causing sweeping power blackouts as winter weather sets in.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said it imposed sanctions on six executives and board members of Iran's Qods Aviation Industries (QAI), also known as Light Airplanes Design and Manufacturing Industries.\n\nThe Treasury described Qods Aviation Industries (QAI), which has been under U.S. sanctions since 2013, as a key Iranian defense manufacturer responsible for designing and producing drones.\n\n\"We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to deny (Russian President Vladimir) Putin the weapons that he is using to wage his barbaric and unprovoked war on Ukraine,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in the statement.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations in New York and Russia's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n11:30 a.m.: A 330 kilovolt (kV) back-up power line to Ukraines Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), that was disconnected last week due to damage caused by shelling, has still not been restored underlining further the facilitys fragile supplies of electricity from the grid, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi said today.\n\n11:15 a.m.: The Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths welcomed Russias announcement for a 36- hour cease fire beginning at noon in Ukraine.\n\n10:30 a.m.: A Russian hacking team known as Cold River targeted three nuclear research laboratories in the United States this past summer, according to internet records reviewed by Reuters and five cyber security experts.\n\nBetween August and September, Cold River targeted the Brookhaven (BNL), Argonne (ANL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), according to internet records that showed the hackers creating fake login pages for each institution and emailing nuclear scientists in a bid to make them reveal their passwords.\n\nReuters was unable to determine why the labs were targeted or if any attempted intrusion was successful. A BNL spokesperson declined to comment. LLNL did not respond to a request for comment. An ANL spokesperson referred questions to the U.S. Department of Energy, which declined to comment.\n\nCold River has escalated its hacking campaign against Kyiv's allies since the invasion of Ukraine, according to cybersecurity researchers and western government officials. The digital blitz against the U.S. labs occurred as U.N. experts entered Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory to inspect Europe's biggest atomic power plant and assess the risk of what both sides said could be a devastating radiation disaster amid heavy shelling nearby.\n\nCold River, which first appeared on the radar of intelligence professionals after targeting Britain's foreign office in 2016, has been involved in dozens of other high-profile hacking incidents in recent years, according to interviews with nine cybersecurity firms. Reuters traced email accounts used in its hacking operations between 2015 and 2020 to an IT worker in the Russian city of Syktyvkar.\n\n\"This is one of the most important hacking groups youve never heard of,\" said Adam Meyer, senior vice president of intelligence at U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. \"They are involved in directly supporting Kremlin information operations.\"\n\nRussia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the domestic security agency that also conducts espionage campaigns for Moscow, and Russia's embassy in Washington did not respond to emailed requests for comment, Reuters reports.\n\n10:00 a.m.: William B Taylor, former US Ambassador to Ukraine, on the future of the Ukraine war.\n\nIn an interview with VOAs Ahmadullah Archiwal, former US Ambassador to Ukraine William B Taylor told that \"Russia will try to intensify the war in Ukraine. However, he added the Russians face a shortage of soldiers on the ground. He also added that though the US has a new parliament, the US will still continue to support Ukraine and that the US and Europe will stand together in supporting Ukraine.\n\n9:45 a.m.: McDonald's is leaving Kazakhstan's biggest city, Almaty. The fast-food giant's local business appeared to fall victim to collateral damage from the Russia-Ukraine war. The company had to shut down because its Kazakh licensee, Food Solutions KZ, could not source its beef patties locally and had to import them from Russia until the war forced it to stop.\n\nThe brand's exit from the Central Asian nation of 20 million divided opinion on social media and among onlookers near one of the Almaty restaurants where workers were taking down the large white letters from the top of the building.\n\n\"It was one of the nicest places where I used to spend time with my friends,\" said local resident Karina, who only gave her first name.\n\n\"I doubt any other company will be able to compete with McDonald's in Kazakhstan at the moment as no other fast-food chain can replicate the menu that McDonald's had for the same price.\"\n\nOthers described the brand's departure as a minor inconvenience or said they would check out other fast-food joints.\n\nChains such KFC YUM.N, Burger King QSR.TO, and Hardee's have restaurants in Kazakhstan and Popeyes said last month it would open dozens of restaurants in the former Soviet republic in partnership with local firm Centras Group.\n\nMcdonald's and Food Solutions did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment, Reuters reports.\n\n9:00 a.m.: Costs for hiring ships to transport commodities from the Black Sea have risen by more than a fifth since the start of the year, reflecting higher war risk insurance rates, industry sources said.\n\nThe Black Sea is crucial for the shipment of grain, oil and oil products. Its waters are shared by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania and Turkey, as well as Russia and Ukraine.\n\nSix insurance sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an exodus of reinsurers from the market had added to unease over the risk of ship seizures by Russia and liabilities related to the war in Ukraine, including floating mines or vessels getting stuck in ports for long periods.\n\nSince the introduction of exclusions this year, insurers who provide cover will not have the cushion of reinsurance in the event of big claims, Reuters reports.\n\nThe sources said no vessels had lost their insurance provision, but they expected higher rates that would vary depending on specific circumstances, and that war risk premiums had so far risen by more than 20%.\n\nThat could add to inflationary pressures, which last year reached multi-decade highs after the Ukraine war drove some commodity prices to record levels.\n\n8:30 a.m.: Germany said on Friday it intends to deliver around 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine before the end of March, and Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said Berlin could ultimately send its entire functioning fleet of the weapons, Reuters reports.\n\nThe United States also pledged Thursday Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and a day after a similar announcement from France.\n\nGovernment spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said a Patriot anti-aircraft missile system from army stocks will also be delivered to Ukraine in the first quarter. Washington has also offered Patriots to Ukraine.\n\nTraining on the Marder vehicle will take place in Germany and last about eight weeks, Hebestreit added.\n\n8:00 a.m.: Ukraine's power grid operator urged civilians to save electricity on Friday as temperatures fell and energy consumption rose, threatening to overload the energy network devastated by Russian air strikes.\n\nRussian missile and drone attacks on energy infrastructure since October have caused widespread damage that has led to winter blackouts and shortages of heating and water.\n\nAfter hovering at around 10 degrees Celsius (50F) during an unseasonably warm spell since New Year, temperatures are now falling. Forecasters say they could soon plunge to -11C in Kyiv and to -18C in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"In the near future, a significant drop in temperature is expected, which will lead to a rapid increase in consumption,\" state-run energy company and grid operator Ukrenergo said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n\"The energy system is currently unable to fully cover it due to the damage and the enemy's occupation of a number of power plants that produce electricity, in particular, and the most powerful - the Zaporizhzhia NPP (nuclear power plant).\"\n\nIt added: \"Please use electricity wisely, alternate the use of energy-intensive appliances. It helps reduce the load on the power system and reduce the need to limit consumption.\" Reuters reports.\n\n7:30 a.m.: Russia said Ukraine shelled Russian military positions on Friday during a 36-hour ceasefire unilaterally declared by President Vladimir Putin, which Kyiv and its allies have dismissed as a sham, Reuters reports.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said that its positions had come under attack in the Luhansk, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, but that its troops were observing the ceasefire.\n\n\"Four mortar shells were fired at Russian positions by the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the direction of Lyman,\" it said.\n\nReuters could not immediately establish if there had been any lull in fighting. Kyiv has said it has no intention of halting fighting for the proposed Russian ceasefire, which Ukraine and its Western allies called a ploy designed to give Moscow time to reinforce troops and equipment.\n\nPutin ordered the 36-hour ceasefire in the 10-month-long war in a surprise move on Thursday, saying it would mark the Russian Orthodox Christian Christmas.\n\n5:21 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that Russian forces continued limited counterattacks to regain lost positions along the Svatove-Kreminna line, and Russian forces said that Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the area.\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly conducted a successful counterattack as Russian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut and west of Donetsk City, the assessment said, as Russian forces continued to operate sabotage and reconnaissance groups on the Dnipro River and reinforce positions in east bank Kherson Oblast.\n\n4:26 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said the Luhansk Peoples Republic and Donetsk Peoples Republic militias were formally integrated into the Russian armed forces Saturday. Both regions \"will likely constitute a large political, diplomatic and financial cost for Russia which will last well beyond the current phase of the conflict,\" the update said.\n\n3:33 a.m.: A married couple and their 12-year-old son were killed when a Russian shell hit a residential building in southern Ukraine on Thursday, Reuters reported, citing a presidential aide.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, said the building in the town of Beryslav in the Kherson region was hit as the family was preparing to celebrate the Orthodox Christian Christmas.\n\n\"People were preparing to celebrate Christmas together, but a cynical blow by the Russians killed them in their own home,\" Tymoshenko wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nRussia denies deliberately targeting civilians in what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine.\n\n2:27 a.m.: Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Byalyatski went on trial in Belarus on Thursday, facing up to 12 years in jail, Reuters reported.\n\nThe 60-year-old, who co-founded the Viasna human rights group, and two other representatives of the group who also went on trial watched from inside a metal cage before proceedings were adjourned until Friday. All pleaded not guilty.\n\nByalyatski is one of the most prominent of hundreds of Belarusians who were jailed during a violent crackdown on anti-government protests that erupted in the summer of 2020.\n\nHe shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Russian rights group Memorial and Ukraine's Center for Civil Liberties last October, but had been arrested in 2021 along with the two co-workers from Viasna.\n\nThe trio face from seven to 12 years in jail on charges of financing protests and smuggling money. Byalyatski has not commented on the allegations publicly and his lawyer is prohibited from disclosing information about the case.\n\n1:20 a.m.: The Kyiv Independent reported that Russian artillery hit Ukraine's Nikopol region overnight Thursday. On Telegram, Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, wrote that the Marhanetska and Chervonohryhorivka communities were struck.\n\n12:02 a.m.: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been invited to visit Ukraine, the government's top spokesperson said Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe invitation was given by the head of Ukraine's Presidential Office Andriy Yermak to Japan's ambassador to Ukraine on Wednesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a regular news conference.\n\n\"Japan stands with the citizens of Ukraine ... and takes appropriate steps as this year's G-7 chair,\" Matsuno said, referring to the Group of Seven nations.\n\nNext week, Kishida is set to visit G-7 member countries including France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, a key diplomatic tour before Japan hosts the annual G-7 summit in May in Hiroshima.\n\nSome information in this report came from Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "KYIV, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Ukraine introduced emergency power cuts in eastern and southeastern regions on Wednesday as low temperatures and difficult weather conditions stretched the country's crippled energy system, officials said.\n\nThe power cuts underscored the weakness of Ukraine's power system after three months of Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Officials have said about 40% of the system has been damaged.\n\nThe national grid operator, Ukrenergo, said emergency power cuts had been introduced in the Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions, and other regions continued with scheduled electricity cuts.\n\n\"This is a forced step to avoid serious accidents and maintain the stable work of the energy system. It has not recovered yet from the enemy's strikes. It has a considerable capacity deficit. Now, due to frosts, electricity usage has increased a lot,\" Valentin Reznichenko, Dnipropetrovsk regional governor, said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergy workers have been trying to repair power lines and generation capacity after the attacks, but difficult winter weather had added to the problems.\n\nUkrenergo said strong winds had damaged networks in some areas. The situation with electricity supplies in frontline regions and in the south was complicated by the extent of the damage inflicted during heavy fighting, it said.\n\nSerhiy Kovalenko, CEO of Yasno energy supplier, said on his Facebook page that \"every -5 (degrees Celsius) added +200 MW (megawatts) in consumption.\"\n\n\"Generation will not increase but consumption is rising. It means the deficit is growing,\" said Kovalenko, urging residents to be ready for electricity cuts and blackouts until the end of March.\n\nReporting by Olena Harmash, Editing by Timothy Heritage\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

An infrared photo accompanying the announcement shows what appears to be a patrol boat on fire.\n\n\"Ukrainian artillery has successfully shot a Russian war boat on the Dnipro River,\" the Ukrainian Defense Ministry tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nThe ship was reportedly in the delta of the strategic river, which bisects Ukraine as well as its capital Kyiv. In November, Russian forces retreated to the east bank of the river. The Ukrainian port city Kherson, which was recaptured in November after it had been occupied by Russia since early March, sits at the mouth of the Dnipro, were the river flows past several islands into the Black Sea via the Dniprovska Gulf.\n\nContinuing the count of casualties\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense ministry posted its daily count of Russian casualties on Tuesday with an additional warship marked sunk, bringing the tally up to 17 since the war began on February 24. Russian Navy Day parade in Baltiysk (credit: REUTERS)\n\nWhile the Russian Black Sea Fleet far surpasses the Ukrainian fleet numerically and enjoys a great degree of control over maritime traffic in the Black Sea, it has been unable to achieve naval superiority in the body of water due to Ukraine's land-to-sea combat capabilities.\n\nWestern nations have supplied anti-ship missiles such as the Harpoon to Ukraine, but it also has its own indigenously developed Neptune missile, a pair of which were famously used to sink the Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva. Advertisement\n\nThe sinking of Russian warships has taken on a greater symbolic meaning to Ukraine in the war, especially online, where it has taken on a memetic quality.\n\nDuring the initial hours of the invasion, the Moskva was part of the task force that took Snake Island. Guards stationed there refused to surrender, saying \"Russian warship, go f*** yourself.\" The phrase has been repeated many times since to express defiance against the Kremlin. The obstinance of the guards and the response to the Moskva, and its sinking, have even been featured on postcards and postal stamps.",

All times EST.\n\n10:02 p.m.: Russia canceled an agreed-upon prisoner swap with Ukraine, which was meant to take place on Saturday, The Kyiv Independent reported, quoting Ukraines Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War.\n\nRussia and Ukraine had agreed to exchange 40 prisoners of war, Russias Human Rights Ombudsman Tatiana Moskalkova told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nRussia reportedly declined to go through with the exchange \"at the last minute,\" although no further details were provided.\n\nAt least 3,392 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians remain in Russian captivity as of Jan. 3, according to Alyona Verbytska, the Presidents Commissioner for Protecting Defenders Rights. These are the numbers that Russia has officially confirmed, she said.\n\n9:20 p.m.: Britain will send 14 Challenger 2 tanks and other heavy weaponry to Ukraine in the coming weeks and will train Ukrainian forces to use the tanks and guns in the coming days, Reuters reported, quoting a statement late Saturday from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's office.\n\n\"The Prime Minister is clear that a long and static war only serves Russia's ends,\" a government spokesperson said in a statement published on its website.\n\n\"That's why he and his ministers will be speaking to our allies across the world in the days and weeks ahead to ramp up pressure on (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and secure a better future for Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Russian Embassy in London said the decision to send the tanks would drag out the confrontation, lead to more victims including civilians, and was evidence of \"the increasingly obvious involvement of London in the conflict.\"\n\n\"As for the Challenger 2 tanks, they are unlikely to help the Armed Forces of Ukraine turn the tide on the battlefield, but they will become a legitimate large target for the Russian artillery,\" the embassy said, according to comments cited by the TASS news agency.\n\n8 p.m.: Sweden and Finland are unlikely to be able to join NATO before June, a senior Turkish official said Saturday, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Nordic states applied to join the Western military alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but their membership must be approved by all 30 NATO states. Turkey and Hungary have yet to approve the deal, with Ankara linking accession to stricter counterterrorism measures.\n\n\"It really depends on how fast they move and how wide and deep they move on these issues,\" said Ibrahim Kalin, spokesman and foreign policy adviser for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\"What they're telling us is the new laws will be fully effective and completed by June, but maybe there are some things they can do before,\" Kalin said.\n\nTurkey has demanded that Sweden and Finland tighten laws to rein in the activities of supporters of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and a group it blames for a 2016 coup attempt.\n\n\"In principle we would like to see them (Sweden and Finland) in NATO,\" Kalin told foreign journalists in Istanbul. \"What they say is that they need a little bit more time. We told them 'You have to meet these conditions,' meaning that they have to send a serious message to the PKK.\"\n\n7:12 p.m.: Rescue teams are working through the night in freezing temperatures, digging survivors from the rubble of a Russian missile attack on Dnipro, in east-central Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nOn Saturday, a Russian missile struck at nine-story apartment building, killing or wounding dozens.\n\nLocal officials say people were still alive underneath the massive pile of wreckage.\n\n\"They keep sending SMS-es,\" Mikhailo Lysenko, deputy mayor of Dnipro said in a social media video. \"We stop our work now and then to keep silence and we hear people scream from underneath the rubble.\"\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, said 37 people had been rescued from the building. Zelenskyy said the second to ninth floors of the building's damaged section had collapsed.\n\n6:40 p.m.: Russia's 10th mass missile strike hit Ukrainian critical infrastructure Saturday across several oblasts, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said, according to The Kyiv Independent.\n\nThe missiles also hit a nine-story apartment in Dnipro, killing or wounding dozens.\n\n5:49 p.m.: As Moscow's forces advance, Russia and Ukraine continue to dispute control of the salt-mining town of Soledar amid scenes of devastation and fierce fighting on the front line in eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has made multiple claims of control in the past week that have been contested by Ukrainian officials, who maintain their forces have not left the town and continue to fight.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry claimed on January 13 to have seized Soledar, but the statement was quickly disputed by Kyiv, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying the fight for the town and others \"in the east of our country continues.\"\n\nRFE/RL could not verify the situation independently, but multiple reports by Russian war correspondents and bloggers who have shown their geolocations via the messaging platform Telegram suggest Russian forces have taken nearly all of Soledar.\n\nUkrainian forces, however, appear to still hold ground on the northwest edge of the town, with Ukraine's 46th Air Assault Brigade saying fighters were surrounded but fighting back. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n4:45 p.m.:\n\n3:30 p.m.: Missile debris was found in the north of Moldova following the latest round of Russian air strikes on Ukraine, Moldova's interior ministry said on Saturday.\n\n\"Following Russia's massive bombardment of Ukraine, a border police patrol discovered ... the remains of a missile, originating from Russia's air attacks on Ukraine,\" the ministry said on Facebook.\n\nRussia did not immediately comment on the report.\n\nReuters reports that similar incidents in Moldova, which borders Ukraine, have occurred in the past. Last December, police found fragments of a missile that came down in a region of northern Moldova near the border with Ukraine\n\n3 p.m.: Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russia's Wagner mercenary group, boasted of his forces' prowess on Saturday amid infighting with the Russian defense ministry over who should get credit for leading Russia's assault on the Ukrainian town of Soledar, Reuters reports.\n\nAfter months of tension between Prigozhin and the military establishment, the split was laid bare Friday when the defense ministry claimed the capture of Soledar which Ukraine disputes and initially made no mention of Wagner's role in months of brutal fighting for the salt-mining town in Ukraine's east.\n\nIn a video message, Prigozhin described Wagner as a fully independent force with its own aircraft, tanks and artillery, saying \"they are probably the most experienced army that exists in the world today.\"\n\nThe short video contained no overt new criticism of the regular army, whose failings Prigozhin has criticized in the past. But it did nothing to dispel the sense of resentment he has previously expressed that the private military group has not been properly recognized for its role in the Ukraine war.\n\n1:45 p.m.: In his nightly video address, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to Western allies for more weapons, after the latest massive missile attack by Russia throughout Ukraine.\n\n\"What is needed for this? Those weapons that are in the warehouses of our partners and that our troops are so waiting for,\" he said.\n\n\"No amount of persuasion or just passing the time will stop the terrorists, who are methodically killing our people with missiles, drones bought in Iran, their own artillery, tanks and mortars,\" he said. \"The whole world knows what can stop and how it's possible to stop those who sow death.\"\n\n1:15 p.m.:\n\n1:05 p.m.: Russia unleashed its 10th mass missile strike targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure on Saturday afternoon, The Kyiv Independent reports.\n\nThe nationwide attack damaged critical infrastructure in several oblasts, according to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. The hits caused emergency blackouts in multiple regions.\n\nThe strike also hit a nine-story apartment building in Dnipro city, killing or injuring dozens, according to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Valentyn Reznichenko. Six children were among the wounded, the official said earlier.\n\nThe air raid alert went off in all Ukrainian oblasts except occupied Luhansk Oblast and Crimea. It is still ongoing.\n\nExplosions were reported in at least 10 Ukrainian regions across the country, such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv, and Odesa oblasts.\n\nLocal authorities reported that air defense was downing Russian missiles in Mykolaiv, Odesa, Kyiv, Khmelnytskyi, Vinnytsia, and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts.\n\nTwo Russian missiles hit a critical infrastructure site in Kharkiv Oblast, leading to emergency power cut-offs, according to Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov.\n\nExplosions were also reported in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city in the northeast of the country, leading to power outages in most of the citys districts and the metros temporary halt, according to multiple media reports.\n\nLviv Oblast Governor Maksym Kozytskyi said the attack also hit a critical infrastructure facility in the western Lviv Oblast. He said there might be interruptions in the power and water supply.\n\nAnother energy facility was hit in the western Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, according to the oblast's governor Svitlana Onyschuk. A fire broke out at the site following the attack, Onyschuk said, adding that there were no casualties.\n\nOdesa authorities earlier said the missiles were launched \"from air and sea.\" Earlier in the day, Southern Operational Command reported that five Russian missile carriers with a total of 36 Kalibr cruise missiles were detected in the Black Sea.\n\n12:25 p.m.: Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev accused Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Saturday of shameful subservience to the United States and suggested he should ritually disembowel himself, Reuters reports.\n\nIt was the latest in a long line of provocative statements from Medvedev, who was once seen as a Western-leaning reformer but has reinvented himself as an arch-hawk since Russia invaded Ukraine last year.\n\nMedvedev was responding to a meeting in Washington DC between Kishida and Biden, after which the two leaders issued a joint statement saying: \"We state unequivocally that any use of a nuclear weapon by Russia in Ukraine would be an act of hostility against humanity and unjustifiable in any way.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Kishida said the G7 summit of major industrialized nations in Hiroshima in May should demonstrate a strong will to uphold international order and rule of law after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMedvedev said the nuclear statement showed \"paranoia\" towards Russia and \"betrayed the memory of hundreds of thousands of Japanese who were burned in the nuclear fire of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,\" a reference to the atomic bombs that the United States dropped on Japan to force its surrender at the end of World War II.\n\nRather than demanding U.S. repentance for this, Kishida had shown he was \"just a service attendant for the Americans,\" he said.\n\n11:45 a.m.: Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko said on Saturday that the coming days would be difficult on the energy front after a heavy military attack by Russia hit critical infrastructure in several regions of the country.\n\n\"Due to the shelling in the majority of the regions, emergency (power) cut-offs are being introduced. The coming days will be difficult,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nGalushchenko said energy infrastructure in six Ukrainian regions was damaged after the attacks.\n\nDTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, said two of its thermal power stations were hit in Saturday's strikes. One station stopped producing electricity.\n\nGovernment officials have previously said that about 40% of Ukraine's energy system has been damaged following three months of missile and drone attacks on the country's energy infrastructure.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president's office, said that more than 300,000 generators were delivered to Ukraine in December as the country battles to survive the cold winter months despite the damage to power infrastructure, Reuters reports.\n\n11:05 a.m.: Ukraine shot down 21 out of 33 incoming missiles fired by Russia at targets across the country on Saturday, Ukraine's top commander Valeriy Zaluzhnyi said on Telegram.\n\nReuters reports Zaluzhnyi saying Ukraine shot down 18 of 28 inbound cruise missiles and three out of five guided air-to-surface missiles.\n\n10:40 a.m.: A Russian strike hit a nine-story residential building in Dnipro Saturday, injuring 18 people, including two children, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Valentyn Reznichenko reported.\n\nReznichenko said there are still people under the rubble. First responders are working on the site.\n\n15 people were evacuated from the building, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the Presidents Office, the Kyiv Independent reports.\n\n9:55 a.m.: Russian missiles struck critical infrastructure facilities on Saturday in Ukraine's Kharkiv and Lviv regions in the country's east and west respectively, local officials said.\n\nThe mayor of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv said explosions could be heard in the city, and that air defenses were engaging targets, Reuters reports.\n\n9:20 a.m. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has indicated that his country would send Ukraine some of its main battle tanks, the Challenger 2, along with additional artillery support. Sunak discussed this during a phone call on Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nSunak's office has previously said Britain would co-ordinate its support with allies after Germany, France and the United States all indicated last week they would provide armored vehicles to Ukraine.\n\n\"The prime minister outlined the UKs ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine, including through the provision of Challenger 2 tanks and additional artillery systems,\" a spokesperson for Sunak said.\n\n\"They agreed on the need to seize on this moment with an acceleration of global military and diplomatic support to Ukraine.\"\n\nSunak's office said further details would be provided shortly, Reuters reports.\n\nThe Challenger 2 is a battle tank designed to attack other tanks and has been in service with the British Army since 1994. It has been deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Iraq, according to the army.\n\n\"The prime minister and President Zelenskyy welcomed other international commitments in this vein, including Polands offer to provide a company of Leopard tanks,\" Sunak's spokesperson said.\n\nAndriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president's staff, thanked Britain for the new defense package.\n\n9:05 a.m.: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv by allowing the export of Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine.\n\nGermany has resisted such a move so far, saying Western tanks should only be supplied to Ukraine if there is agreement among Kyiv's main allies, particularly the United States.\n\nWestern officials want to strike a balance between ensuring Ukraine can defend itself and not supplying arms that could encourage Kyiv to make attacks on Russia or draw NATO into conflict with Moscow. They also fear that during battle advanced armament technology could fall in the hands of the enemy, Reuters reports.\n\nThe Leopard 2 is one of the most widely used Western tanks. But in general, three decades after the end of the Cold War, tanks and other heavy weapons are in scarce supply in most of the West. Many countries drastically reduced their armies after the fall of communism.\n\nThe tank weighs more than 60 tons, has a 120mm smoothbore gun and can hit targets at a distance of up to five km.\n\nEven if production were ramped up, experts say it could take at least two years for the first new tanks to leave the factory.\n\n8:30 a.m.: Turkey said Saturday it was ready to push for local ceasefires in Ukraine and warned that neither Moscow nor Kyiv had the military means to \"win the war militarily on the ground\".\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan's foreign policy adviser Ibrahim Kalin said it seemed unlikely that the warring sides were ready to strike an \"overarching peace deal\" in the coming months.\n\nBut he said that the brutal cost of fighting might soon see them reconsider and accept localized truces in specific parts of the war zone.\n\n\"Turkey is willing to push for local ceasefires and small localized de-escalations,\" Kalin told reporters.\n\nNATO member Turkey hosted two early rounds of peace talks and helped strike a UN-backed agreement restoring Ukrainian grain deliveries across the Black Sea, AFP reports.\n\n8:15 a.m.: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio KIshida after meeting U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington on Friday, stressed the importance of standing up to Russia's invasion, saying that if a unilateral change to the status quo went unchallenged, the same would happen elsewhere, including in Asia - an apparent reference to China's vow to reunite with self-ruled Taiwan, by force if necessary, Reuters reports.\n\n7:45 a.m.: Air raid sirens blared across most of Ukraine on Saturday. Officials told residents to take shelter from a possible Russian air attack.\n\nThe regional governor of Mykolaiv, Vitaliy Kim, said Russian missiles had already been spotted flying in Ukraine's south and that air defenses were working, Reuters reports.\n\n5:09 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that Russian forces conducted limited counterattacks along the Svatove-Kreminna line while Ukrainian forces reportedly continued counteroffensive operations near Kreminna. Russian forces continued offensive operations around Soledar, Bakhmut, and Avdiivka. Ukrainian partisan attacks, meanwhile, continue to divert Russian resources away from the frontline to rear areas in occupied territories.\n\n4:13 a.m.: Russia's continued blocking of Ukraine's Black Sea ports and deliberate slowdown of ship inspections are delaying crucial grain shipments around the world, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Friday, The Kyiv Independent reported.\n\nFollowing Russia's Black Sea blockade of Ukraine's ports in the early days of the full-scale invasion, a U.N-backed deal in July allowed grain shipments to partially resume from some ports.\n\nSince then, Russia has been accused of deliberately holding up inspections to slow grain shipments in an effort to discredit the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Russia has also falsely alleged that grain shipments have not made it to countries that need it most.\n\nAccording to Greenfield, Russias attacks and continued blocking of some Ukrainian ports have decreased Ukraines food exports by about 30%.\n\n\"Heres the truth: The Initiatives operations are not keeping pace with the strong global demand for Black Sea grain. Due to Russias deliberate slowdown of inspections, dozens of ships are waiting to depart. And dozens more are waiting for inspections before they can bring their grain cargo to the world,\" Greenfield said.\n\n3:31 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said Russia has deployed 10 vessels from its Black Sea Fleet, likely in response to what Russia perceives is a threat to Novorossiysk. \"It is unlikely that the deployment signifies preparation for unusual maritime-launched cruise-missile strikes,\" the update said. \"It is highly unlikely that the fleet is preparing for amphibious assault operations.\"\n\n2:08 a.m.: The French and German foreign ministers called Friday on Africa to condemn Russian aggression in Ukraine, while pressing for deeper ties between the European Union and countries across the continent, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"We have common interests and we have expectations of our African friends,\" French minister Catherine Colonna told a press briefing at the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa.\n\nThe call was echoed by her German counterpart Annalena Baerbock who said that peace in Europe was under attack.\n\n\"We need you, we need Africa to defend peace,\" Baerbock said.\n\nUkraine and Russia are major suppliers of wheat and other cereals to Africa, and the war's impact has been felt across the continent with sharp increases in the price of fuel, grain and fertilizer.\n\nBut many African nations have shown a reluctance to condemn Russia's invasion.\n\n1:09 a.m.:\n\n12:02 a.m.: Shakhtar Donetsk and eight Russian soccer clubs lost their appeals Friday against FIFA emergency transfer rules that let foreign players and coaches suspend their contracts during Russia's invasion of Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nIn separate rulings by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Ukraine's Shakhtar had its appeal dismissed in a case heard in December which sought $42 million compensation from FIFA.\n\nThe Russian clubs, led by champion Zenit St. Petersburg, faced FIFA in November at sport's highest court. Two of the three judges who ruled in that case also heard the Shakhtar appeal.\n\nBoth appeals challenged a FIFA decision last June to extend emergency transfer rules for the entire 2022-23 season that were first applied last March for the rest of that season.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.",

He also posted a picture which showed a nine-storey apartment block, part of which had collapsed entirely.\n\n3:43pm: Russian embassy to UK warns that tank delivery will 'intensify' conflict\n\nBritain's pledge to send heavy Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine will only \"intensify\" the conflict, the Russian embassy to the UK warned on Saturday.\n\n\"Bringing tanks to the conflict zone, far from drawing the hostilities to a close, will only serve to intensify combat operations, generating more casualties, including among the civilian population\", the embassy said.\n\n3:39pm: Russia hits key infrastructure in Kharkiv, Lviv, say officials\n\nRussia hit key infrastructure in the eastern Ukrainian region of Kharkiv and in the western Lviv region, officials said Saturday, while a power facility in Kyiv was targeted earlier.\n\n\"Emergency power cuts are currently being applied\" in the Kharkiv region, governor Oleg Synegubov said, after critical infrastructure was hit twice.\n\nLviv regional administration head Maksym Kozytsky warned of potential \"interruptions in electricity and water supply\" after \"the enemy hit a critical infrastructure facility in the Lviv region.\"\n\n2:07pm: Turkey ready to push for 'local ceasefires' in Ukraine\n\nTurkey said Saturday it was ready to push for local ceasefires in Ukraine and warned that neither Moscow nor Kyiv had the military means to \"win the war\".\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan's foreign policy adviser Ibrahim Kalin conceded that it seemed unlikely that the warring sides were ready to strike an \"overarching peace deal\" in the coming months.\n\nBut he said that the brutal cost of fighting might soon see them reconsider and accept localised truces in specific parts of the war zone.\n\n\"Turkey is willing to push for local ceasefires and small localised de-escalations,\" Kalin told reporters. \"Neither party is in a position to win the war militarily, on the ground.\"\n\n1:48pm: Air raid sirens sound across most of Ukraine, officials say\n\nAir raid sirens wailed across most of Ukraine on Saturday and officials told residents to take shelter from a possible Russian air attack.\n\nThe regional governor of Mykolaiv, Vitaliy Kim, said Russian missiles had already been spotted flying in Ukraine's south and that air defences were working.\n\n1:43pm: Sunak says Britain will send tanks to Ukraine\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Saturday said the UK will provide tanks to Ukraine to help Kyiv's forces \"push Russian troops back\".\n\nSunak made the pledge to supply Challenger 2 tanks and additional artillery systems as a sign of the UK's \"ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine\", according to a readout of a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe move makes the UK the first Western power to supply the Ukrainians with main battle tanks, the PA news agency said. France on January 4 said it would supply Kyiv with the French-made AMX-10 RC a light tank model.\n\n\"In a conversation with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, I thanked (him) for the decisions that will not only strengthen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners,\" Zelensky responded on Twitter.\n\n1:14pm: 'Russians do seem to prefer a symbolic date' for attacks on Ukraine infrastructure\n\nKyiv has been hit by \"what seems to be another Russian missile strike, the first in around about two weeks,\" FRANCE 24's Luke Shargo reported from Mykolaiv. \"It's the old [Orthodox calendar] New Year today and Ukrainians have been saying that the Russians do seem to prefer a symbolic date, and this would be the first time they've struck since the New Year.\"\n\n02:36\n\n11:21pm: 'Ukrainian authorities do not want to admit having lost control of Soledar'\n\n\"The picture that seems to be coming through from journalists who are near Soledar relating what they have observed, and from some Ukrainian military figures or military bloggers posting on social media, it does appear as though even from the Ukrainian side there is an admission that Ukrainian forces have had to leave the town centre of Soledar,\" FRANCE 24's Gulliver Cragg reported from Sumy in northeastern Ukraine. \"I think that they have not entirely been pushed beyond the city limits; that's the picture that I am getting.\n\n\"Certainly the Ukrainian authorities do not want to admit having lost control of Soledar. President Volodymyr Zelensky in his evening address to Ukrainians said that the battle for Soledar continues. This morning in their morning the Ukrainian general staff don't really give any specific details about the situation in Soledar, [they were] just talking about the broader battle for Bakhmut, which was the nearest big city to Soledar, which is in a way the real prize in this particular part of the Russian offensive, in saying that that battle continues.\"\n\n01:49\n\n9:41am: Ukrainian governor says massive Russian missile attack possible later on Saturday\n\nThe governor of the central Cherkasy region warned Ukrainians that Russia could launch a massive missile strike later on Saturday and urged residents to take shelter during air raid sirens.\n\nSeparately, Vitaly Kim, regional governor of the southern Mykolayiv region, said that 17 Russian Tupolev bombers had taken off from their air bases. His statement came shortly after air attacks in Kyiv and Kharkiv hit critical infrastructure.\n\n8:53am: Russian missile attack hits infrastructure in Kyiv\n\nSeveral explosions resonated in Ukraine's capital on Saturday morning, AFP journalists heard, as officials reported strikes on key infrastructure.\n\n\"Missile attack on critical infrastructure facilities\" in Kyiv, the Deputy Head of Presidency Kyrylo Tymoshenko said on Telegram. The city administration said an infrastructure facility had been hit.\n\nKyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko reported explosions in the Dniprovskiy district and urged residents to \"stay in shelters!\".

That was on top of 31 missile attacks and 12 airstrikes across the country in the past 24 hours.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin signaled no letup to his assault on Ukraine, in a grim and defiant New Year's speech that contrasted with a hopeful message of gratitude and unity from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nAs sirens blared in Kyiv, some people shouted from their balconies, \"Glory to Ukraine! Glory to heroes!\"\n\nFragments from the late-night attack caused minimal damage in the capital's center, and preliminarily reports indicated there were no wounded or casualties, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on social media. Attacks earlier on Saturday had hit residential buildings and a hotel in the capital, killing at least one person and injuring more than 20.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said on Twitter: \"Russia coldly and cowardly attacked Ukraine in the early hours of the new year. But Putin still does not seem to understand that Ukrainians are made of iron.\"\n\nAt the front line in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk Province, troops toasted the new year. Soldier Pavlo Pryzhehodskiy, 27, played a song on guitar he had written at the front after 12 of his comrades were killed in a single night.\n\n\"It is sad that instead of meeting friends, celebrating and giving gifts to one another people were forced to seek shelter, some were killed,\" he told Reuters. \"It is a huge tragedy. It is a huge tragedy that cannot ever be forgiven. That is why the New Year is sad.\"\n\nIn a nearby front line trench, soldier Oleh Zahrodskiy, 49, said he had signed up as a volunteer after his son was called up to fight as a reservist. His son was now in a hospital in the southern city of Dnipro, fighting for his life with a brain injury, while his father manned the front.\n\n\"It is very tough now,\" he said, holding back tears.\n\n'Happy New Year'\n\nAndrii Nebytov, chief of Kyiv's police, posted a photo on his Telegram messaging app, showing what was described as a piece of drone used in an attack on the capital, with a hand-written sign on it in Russian saying \"Happy New Year.\"\n\n\"This wreckage is not at the front, where fierce battles are taking place, this is here, on a sports grounds, where children play,\" Nebytov said.\n\nRussia has flattened Ukrainian cities and killed thousands of civilians since Putin ordered his invasion in February, claiming Ukraine was an artificial state whose pro-Western outlook threatened Russia's security. Moscow has since claimed to have annexed around a fifth of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has fought back with Western military support, driving Russian forces from more than half the territory they seized. In recent weeks, the front lines have been largely static, with thousands of soldiers dying in intense trench warfare as Moscow defends its grip on captured territory.\n\nSince October, Russia has launched mass missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, casting cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Moscow says the strikes aim to reduce Ukraine's ability to fight; Kyiv says they have no military purpose and are intended to hurt civilians, a war crime.\n\n\"The main thing is the fate of Russia,\" a stern-faced Putin said in his New Year's Eve address, speaking in front of a group of people dressed in military uniform instead of the normal backdrop of the Kremlin walls. \"Defence of the fatherland is our sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants. Moral, historical righteousness is on our side.\"\n\nZelenskyy delivered his own address in near darkness, in front of a fluttering Ukrainian flag. He described the year past as a national awakening.\n\n\"We were told: 'You have no other option but to surrender.' We say: 'We have no other option than to win,'\" he said.\n\n\"This year has struck our hearts. We've cried out all the tears. We've shouted all the prayers,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We fight and will continue to fight. For the sake of the keyword: 'victory.'\"\n\nThe latest airstrikes damaged infrastructure in Sumy, in the northeast of the country, Khmelnytskyi in the west and Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the southeast and south, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said.\n\n\"Let the day be quiet,\" Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region said early on Sunday, after reporting heavy shelling of several communities in the region overnight that wounded one.\n\nGrid operator Ukrenergo said on Sunday the past day had been \"difficult\" for its workers but that the electricity situation was \"under control\" and emergency outages were not being implemented.\n\n\"Additional volumes of electricity for household consumers have been provided thanks to the conscious behavior of Ukrainian business and restrictions on the work of industry,\" it said in a statement.\n\nSeparately, Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the southern Russian region of Belgorod bordering Ukraine, said overnight shelling of the outskirts of Shebekino town had damaged houses but there were no casualties.\n\nRussian media also reported multiple Ukrainian attacks on the Moscow-controlled parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with local officials saying at least nine people were wounded.\n\nRussia's RIA state news agency cited a local doctor as saying six people were killed when a hospital in Donetsk was attacked on Saturday. Proxy authorities in Donetsk also said one person had been killed by Ukrainian shelling.\n\nReuters could not verify the reports. There was no immediate response from Kyiv, which almost never publicly claims responsibility for any attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territories in Ukraine.",

That claim could not be independently verified.\n\nRussian bloggers say many of the victims were reservists recently mobilised into the army.\n\nAbout 200 people laid roses and wreaths in a central square in the city of Samara where some of the servicemen came from as an Orthodox priest recited a prayer.\n\nSoldiers also fired a gun salute at the commemoration, where some of the mourners could be seen holding flags for the ruling United Russia party.\n\n\"Its very tough, its scary. But we cannot be broken. Grief unites,\" Ekaterina Kolotovkina, head of a group of army spouses, said at the ceremony.\n\nAt the gathering in Samara, Kolotovkina, the wife of a general, said she had asked her husband to \"avenge\" the victims.\n\n00:00:51 Moment missile hits Kyiv on New Years Eve caught on newly released CCTV footage video\n\n\"We will crush the enemy together.

Satellite images taken by US-based company Planet Labs dated 20 December and 2 January show the aftermath of Ukraines strike on the Russian-held city of Makiivka. The vocational school reportedly housed recently mobilised troops sent by Moscow when it was hit on 1 January.\n\nOn Wednesday Russia claimed the use of mobile phones by soldiers on New Years Eve had led to the deadly strike on Makiivka.\n\n\"Currently, a commission is working to investigate the circumstances of what has happened,\" Lt Gen Sergei Sevryukov said in a video statement released by the Russian defence ministry early Wednesday.\n\n\"But it is already obvious that the main reason was the turning on and massive use by personnel of mobile phones within reach of enemy weapons contrary to the ban,\" he said. He did not provide evidence for the claim.\n\nThe ministry also suggested that as revenge for the attack, it launched airstrikes at a \"hardware concentration\" near Druzhkivka railway station in Donetsk, killing up to 200 Ukrainian personnel, and destroying four Himars launchers and more than 800 rockets.\n\nReuters was not able to independently verify the report.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Tuesday that two people were wounded in the attack on Druzhkivka, which destroyed an ice hockey arena.\n\nThe deaths in Makiivka sparked heavy criticism in Russia of the armys senior command, including from nationalist commentators favourable to the militarys intervention in Ukraine.\n\nRussian military correspondents, who have gained influence in recent months, said hundreds could have been killed and accused Russias top commanders of incompetence.\n\nThere have also been reports that the servicemen were quartered next to a munitions depot which exploded in the strike.\n\nThe Telegram account Rybar, which has around a million followers, said it was \"criminally naive\" for the army to store ammunition next to sleeping quarters.\n\nPutin had yet to react to the Makiivka strike, which comes during a holiday season before Orthodox Christmas which many Russians spend with their families.\n\nThe defence ministry said the strike was carried out by Himars rocket systems supplied to Ukraine by the United States.\n\nThese systems have allowed Ukrainian forces to strike much deeper into Russian-held territory and have been credited for a series of battlefield reversals against Russia in recent months.\n\nUkraine said it had faced waves of Russian drone and missile attacks since New Years Eve, mainly targeting energy and other critical infrastructure.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zelenskiy said he had spoken by phone with the leaders of Britain, Norway and the Netherlands and pointed to \"the risks of escalation at the front\".\n\nThe hardest fighting is raging around the city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine a location with little strategic importance that Russian forces led by the mercenary group Wagner have been trying to capture for months.\n\nWagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman close to Putin, admitted in an interview that the fighting was tough and claimed Ukrainian forces had turned \"each house into a fortress\".\n\nPrigozhin told state news agency RIA Novosti in the interview on Tuesday that his men were sometimes fighting \"several weeks for a single house\".\n\nWith Reuters and AFP",

Kyiv, the capital, was also targeted.\n\nSunaks Downing Street office said in a statement that he made the pledge to provide Challenger 2 tanks and other artillery systems after speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday.\n\nIt did not say when the tanks were to be delivered or how many. British media has reported that four British Army Challenger 2 main battle tanks will be sent to eastern Europe immediately, with eight more to follow shortly after, without citing sources.\n\nZelenskyy in a tweet Saturday thanked Sunak \"for the decisions that will not only strengthen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners.\"\n\nUkraine has for months sought to be supplied with heavier tanks, including the U.S. Abrams and the German Leopard 2 tanks, but Western leaders have been treading carefully.\n\nThe Czech Republic and Poland have provided Soviet-era T-72 tanks to Ukrainian forces. Poland has also expressed readiness to provide a company of Leopard tanks, but President Andrzej Duda stressed during his recent visit to the Ukrainian city of Lviv that the move would be possible only as an element in a larger international coalition of tank aid to Kyiv.\n\nEarlier this month, France pledged to supply its AMX-10 RC armored combat vehicles designated as \"light tanks\" in French to Ukraine.\n\nSunak's announcement came as Russian forces fired missiles at Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine on Saturday in the first major barrage in days.\n\nIn Dnipro, rescuers were using a crane to try to evacuate people trapped in the apartment building's upper stories, some of whom were signaling with the flashlights on their mobile phones, Tymoshenko said on Telegram. He also said there were likely people under the rubble.\n\nIn the northeastern Kharkiv region, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said two Russian missiles hit an infrastructure object again Saturday afternoon after a similar attack in the morning, In the city of Kharkiv, the subway suspended operations amid the attacks, according to its Telegram channel.\n\nAnother infrastructure facility was hit in the western Lviv region, according to Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi.\n\nAir defense systems were activated in other regions of Ukraine, and as another round of air raid sirens sounded across the country in the afternoon, regional officials urged residents to seek shelter.\n\nVitali Kim, governor of the southern Mykolaiv region, hinted in a Telegram post that some missiles have been intercepted over his province.\n\nMilitary top commander Valeri Zaluzhny said that Russia fired 33 cruise missiles overall on Saturday, of which 21 were shot down.\n\nEarlier in the day, explosions rocked the capital, Kyiv. The blasts occurred before air sirens sounded, which is unusual. It's likely the explosions came ahead of the warning sirens because the attack was by ballistic missiles, which are faster than cruise missiles or drones.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat, Russia attacked Kyiv with ballistic missiles flying from the north.\n\n\"The ballistics are not easy for us to detect and shoot down,\" he told local media. The warning about the missile threat was late because of the lack of radar data and information from other sources.\n\nAn infrastructure target was hit in the morning missile attack, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nExplosions were heard in the Dniprovskyi district, a residential area on the left bank of the Dnieper River, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Klitschko also said fragments of a missile fell on a nonresidential area in the Holosiivskyi district on the right bank. No casualties have been reported.\n\nThis was the first attack on the Ukrainian capital since Jan. 1.\n\nOn Saturday morning, two Russian missiles hit Kharkiv, Ukraines second-largest city. The strikes with S-300 missiles targeted \"energy and industrial objects of Kharkiv and the (outlying) region,\" Syniehubov said. No casualties have been reported, but emergency power cuts in the city and other settlements of the region were possible, the official said.\n\nIn the city of Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine where fighting is most intense, three people were killed in Russian artillery attacks on Saturday, Mayor Vitalii Barabash said.\n\nThe attacks follow conflicting reports on the fate of the fiercely contested salt mining town of Soledar, in Ukraine's embattled east. Russia claims that its forces have captured the town, a development that would mark a rare victory for the Kremlin after a series of humiliating setbacks on the battlefield.\n\nUkrainian deputy defense minister Hanna Malyar said Saturday that the \"fiece battles for Soledar are continuing.\"\n\nMoscow has painted the battle for the town and the nearby city of Bakhmut as key to capturing the eastern region of the Donbas, which is made up of partially occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and as a way to grind down the best Ukrainian forces and prevent them from launching counterattacks elsewhere.\n\nBut that cuts both ways, as Ukraine says its fierce defense of the eastern strongholds has helped tie up Russian forces. Western officials and analysts say the two towns importance is more symbolic than strategic.",

                "cc_text": "January 5, 8pm ET\n\nClick here to see ISWs interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putins announcement that Russian forces will conduct a 36-hour ceasefire between January 6 and January 7 in observance of Russian Orthodox Christmas is likely an information operation intended to damage Ukraines reputation. Putin instructed Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to initiate a ceasefire from 1200 January 6 to 2400 January 7 along the \"entire line of contact between parties in Ukraine\" and called on Ukraine to accept the ceasefire to allow \"a large number of citizens of citizens professing Orthodoxy\" to attend services on the day of Russian Orthodox Christmas.[1] Putins announcement was ostensibly in response to an appeal by Patriarch Kirill of Moscow (head of the Kremlin-controlled Russian Orthodox Church) for a temporary ceasefire in observance of Christmas Eve and the Day of the Nativity of Christ.[2] Ukrainian and Western officials, including US President Joe Biden, immediately highlighted the hypocrisy of the ceasefire announcement and emphasized that Russian forces continued striking Ukrainian military and civilian infrastructure on December 25when many Orthodox Ukrainians celebrate Christmasand New Years.[3]\n\nPutin could have been seeking to secure a 36-hour pause for Russian troops to afford them the ability to rest, recoup, and reorient to relaunch offensive operations in critical sectors of the front. Such a pause would disproportionately benefit Russian troops and begin to deprive Ukraine of the initiative. Putin cannot reasonably expect Ukraine to meet the terms of this suddenly declared ceasefire and may have called for the ceasefire to frame Ukraine as unaccommodating and unwilling to take the necessary steps towards negotiations. This is an intentional information tactic that Russia has previously employed, as ISW has reported.[4] Ceasefires also take time to organize and implement. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov notably said on December 14 that Russia has no plans for a ceasefire for Russian Orthodox Christmas, so Putins sudden January 5 announcement was surprising.[5] The date of Russian Orthodox Christmas in 2023, after all, has been known for centuries. Had Putin been serious about a religiously motivated ceasefire he had ample time to prepare for it. The announcement of a ceasefire within 24 hours of when it is meant to enter into force suggests that it was announced with the intention of framing Ukrainian forces who continue to fight throughout the timeframe of the ceasefire as unwilling to work towards peace and wanting to fight at all costs.\n\nPutins framing of the ceasefire on religious grounds additionally reinforces another two-fold Russian information operation that frames Ukraine as suppressing religious groups and positions Putin as the true protector of the Christian faith. As ISW has previously observed, the Kremlin has weaponized discussions of Eastern Orthodox Christianity to accuse Kyiv of oppressing religious liberties in Ukraine.[6] Russian sources have recently picked up on raids carried out by the Ukrainian State Security Service (SBU) against Russian Orthodox churches and clergy members and Ukrainian sanctions against Kremlin-linked elements of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Moscow Patriarchate (UOC MP).[7] These measures are not efforts to suppress religious liberties in Ukraine but rather are aimed at explicitly pro-Kremlin elements of the Russian Orthodox Church that have materially, politically, and spiritually supported Russian aggression against Ukraine.[8] The invocation of a ceasefire on distinctly religious grounds in line with Russian Orthodox Christian tradition is a subcomponent of this information operation. Suddenly announcing a ceasefire with that should have been negotiated well in advance in observance of Russian Orthodox Christmas will allow Russia to frame Ukraine as infringing on the right of believers to celebrate the holiday as hostilities will likely continue into January 6 and 7. This information operation can support the baseless Kremlin narrative that Ukraine was persecuting Orthodox Christians and Russian speakers, a narrative that Putin has repeatedly advanced as justification for his illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe ceasefire announcement positions Putin as the guarantor of Christian values and beliefs. Putin and other Russian officials have frequently framed the war in Ukraine as a religious war against \"Satanic\" and \"fanatical\" elements of Ukrainian society that seek to undermine traditional religious values and morality.[9] Putins proposed ceasefire supports false Russian information operations that Russia is fighting a holy war against an immoral Ukrainian society and its secular Western overseers. In actuality, Russian forces have suppressed religious freedom in occupied Ukrainian territory since 2014.[10]\n\nThe pro-war Russian milblogger information space responded to the ceasefire announcement with vitriolic discontent. Several prominent milbloggers emphasized that Russian soldiers do not want a ceasefire at all and remarked that it is a useless, defeatist ploy that is unlikely to succeed in the first place.[11] One milblogger who was previously embedded with Russian units in Bakhmut and attended the annexation ceremony at the Kremlin in September employed overtly genocidal, dehumanizing rhetoric in response to the ceasefire and stated that Russian soldiers do not want compromise: They \"want to kill every person dressed in the uniform of the enemy army, regardless of gender and the circumstances that forced the subhuman [sic] to wear this uniform.\"[12] This level of vitriol originating from milbloggers who are typically fairly aligned with Putins line on the war is noteworthy and undermines Putins ability to present Russia as the party that is willing to negotiate. Putins continued association with this milblogger community, especially those who frequently openly call for genocide, continues to demonstrate the fact that Putin has not decided to compromise his aims in Ukraine.\n\nPutin reiterated his maximalist objectives in a telephone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on January 5. Putin emphasized that Moscow remains open to negotiations with Kyiv as long as such negotiations \"take into account new territorial realities.\"[13] Accounting for \"territorial realities\" in the context of negotiations means hammering Ukraine into making concessions that directly undermine its territorial sovereignty.[14] NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg also noted on January 5 that there are no indicators that the Kremlins ambitions have changed.[15]\n\nThe use of a ceasefire as an information operation, coupled with Putins continued propagation of maximalist goals in Ukraine, continues to indicate that Putin has no desire to actually negotiate with Ukraine. Additionally, Putins continued alignment with and decision to platform milbloggers who routinely use openly genocidal language and call for unrestrained hostilities offer clear indicators of his intentions along these lines. If and when Putin becomes serious about seeking compromises that Ukraine and the West could seriously contemplate accepting, he will have set conditions with the vocal and prominent nationalist community he is currently empowering and courting. He could threaten, marginalize, de-platform, co-opt, or cajole the pro-war milbloggers into accepting more limited objectives, but such activities would be apparent in the information space. As long as Putin continues to give air and prominence to such extremists, however, it will remain clear that he does not intend to abandon his maximalist aims.\n\nWagner Financier Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed that prisoners who volunteered with the Wagner Group in Ukraine received pardons, likely in a bid to inflate his influence and political power. Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti reported that Prigozhin told reporters that two dozen former prisoners completed six-moth contracts with the Wagner Group fighting in Ukraine and received pardons.[16] Russian sources published footage of Prigozhin holding a ceremony for the Wagner Group personnel at a rehabilitation center in Anapa, Krasnodar Krai, in which he awarded the former prisoners state medals and pardon papers.[17] ISW has not observed any official Russian government source comment on whether the Wagner personnel did indeed receive these pardons. Under the Russian Criminal Code and Article 89 of the Russian Constitution, only the Russian President may issue a pardon to an individual, although regionally based pardon commissions and individuals may petition the Russian President to pardon specific individuals.[18] It is possible that Prigozhin submitted petitions to pardon the former prisoners on their behalf. It is also possible that Prigozhin is claiming that the former prisoners received pardons when in actuality a Russian court may have issued them a \"Release from Punishment\" (a commuting of a prison sentence and/or other criminal punishment) or the State Duma of the Russian Federation granted the former prisoners amnesty.[19] ISW has not observed any official Russian sources report that a Russian court or the State Duma has taken either of these legal actions on behalf of these former prisoners, although it is perfectly possible that they did. Previous reporting suggested that the Wagner Group promised prisoners \"full exemption from their criminal punishment\" and not necessarily that prisoners would receive pardons.[20]\n\nPrigozhin is likely using the ambiguity of the legal status of these former prisoners to create the impression that he is influential enough to be able to secure pardons for Wagner Group personnel. Prigozhin likely publicized the granting of the pardon papers to reflect this supposed influence in support of ongoing efforts to cast himself as the central figure in the ultra-nationalist pro-war community.[21] By appearing to take public credit for pardoning these criminals Prigozhin risks seeming to arrogate to himself powers that only Putin actually wields.\n\nPrigozhin also likely publicized the pardons to strengthen the Wagner Groups ongoing recruitment of prisoners and to assuage current Wagner Group personnels possible concerns about promised legal rewards. US National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby reported on December 22, 2022, that the Wagner Group currently has 50,000 personnel deployed to Ukraine, including 40,000 convicts recruited from Russian prisons.[22] Kirby reported that over 1,000 Wagner Group personnel died in Ukraine in a month, and Russian opposition outlet The Insider reported on November 5 that 500 former prisoners volunteering with the Wagner Group died in Ukraine in two months.[23] The Wagner Group likely needs to replenish its forces after heavy losses, predominantly of former prisoners, and Prigozhin likely publicized the supposed pardons to augment the Wagner Groups recruitment campaign in Russian prisons. Prigozhin also likely publicized the pardons to reassure the reportedly 80 percent of deployed Wagner Group personnel in Ukraine who have been promised some type of legal reward for their participation in hostilities. Prigozhin has increasingly pinned his standing in the Russian ultra-nationalist pro-war community on the Wagner Groups ability to capture territory and, particularly, on its offensive on Bakhmut.[24] Prigozhin likely intends to further motivate Wagner personnel and generate new paramilitary forces in a misguided and implausible effort to reverse the culmination of the Bakhmut offensive.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putins announcement that Russian forces will conduct a 36-hour ceasefire in observance of Russian Orthodox Christmas is likely an information operation intended to damage Ukraines reputation.\n\nPutins framing of the ceasefire on religious ground reinforces another Russian information operation that falsely frames Ukraine as suppressing religious groups and positions Putin as the true protector of the Christian faith.\n\nPutin has not changed his fundamental maximalist objectives in Ukraine.\n\nWagner Financier Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed that prisoners who volunteered with the Wagner Group in Ukraine received pardons, likely in a bid to inflate his influence and political power, strengthen Wagner Groups prisoner recruitment, and reassure Wagner Group criminals in uniform.\n\nRussian forces continued limited counterattacks to regain lost positions along the Svatove-Kreminna line, and Russian forces claimed that Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the area.\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly conducted a successful counterattack as Russian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut and west of Donetsk City.\n\nRussian forces continued to operate sabotage and reconnaissance groups on the Dnipro River and reinforce positions in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast.\n\nRussian milbloggers claimed recent Russian successes in Zaporizhia Oblast, likely to distract from the slow Russian offensive around Bakhmut that may be culminating.\n\nMobilized Russian servicemembers likely continue to represent an outsized portion of Russian military casualties in Ukraine.\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian CounteroffensivesEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and one supporting effort)\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortCapture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting EffortSouthern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast)\n\nRussian forces continued limited counterattacks to regain lost positions along the Svatove-Kreminna line on January 5. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian assault near Stelmakhivka (16km northwest of Svatove).[25] A Russian milblogger claimed that battles in the past week between Ukrainian and Russian forces northwest of Svatove have been positional in nature and that control of terrain has not changed.[26] The Ukrainian General Staff also reported that Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian assault near Ploshchanka (17km northwest of Kreminna).[27] A Russian milblogger claimed that elements of the 3rd Motorized Rifle Division of the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army of the Western Military District have been conducting an offensive or a very active defense along the Ploshchanka-Makiivka line (22km northwest of Kreminna) for the past few weeks.[28] Another Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces are trying to push Ukrainian forces back from positions near the R-66 (Svatove-Kreminna) highway and that fighting is the fiercest near Chervonopopivka (6km north of Kreminna).[29] The Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian artillery units can currently interdict all Russian movements on the highway and that Russian forces intend to resume movements along the highway after pushing Ukrainian forces further back.[30] Luhansk Oblast Head Serhiy Haidai stated on January 5 that Russian forces transferred mobilized servicemembers and Wagner Group personnel to the Kreminna area out of fear that the tactical situation in the area was worsening.[31] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces also conducted an assault towards Bilohorivka, Luhansk Oblast (12km south of Kreminna).[32]\n\nRussian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the directions of Svatove and Kreminna on January 5. A Russian milblogger claimed on January 5 that Ukrainian forces regularly conduct night raids on Russian positions near Kuzemivka (15km northwest of Savtove) intending to exhaust Russian combat power in the area.[33] A BARS-13 (Russian Combat Reserve) affiliated source claimed on January 5 that Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups routinely attempt to penetrate Russian positions in the direction of Svatove.[34] A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces are attempting to cut a section of the R-66 highway that leads into Kreminna near Chervonopopivka, where both Russian and Ukrainian forces have been conducting assaults and counterattacks in the past week.[35] Another Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces unsuccessfully attempted to advance towards Russian positions in the Kreminna area on January 5.[36]\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly conducted a successful counterattack as Russian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut on January 4 and 5. The Ukrainian State Border Guards Service reported on January 4 that Ukrainian soldiers conducted a tactical counterattack in Bakhmut and advanced 300 meters in an unspecified area, forcing Russian troops to withdraw from certain unspecified positions.[37] Russian sources refuted this report and claimed that Russian troops have advanced northeast and south of Bakhmut and made gains within Bakhmut itself.[38] The Ukrainian General Staff stated on January 5 that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks on Bakhmut itself; northeast of Bakhmut near Bilohorivka (22km northeast), Soledar (10km northeast), Krasna Hora (5km north), Vyimka (25km northeast), and Pidhorodne (5km northeast); and south of Bakhmut near Kurdyumivka (12km southwest), Mayorsk (20km south), and Pivnichne (20km southwest).[39] Geolocated footage posted between January 4 and 5 indicates that Russian troops have made marginal advances south of Bakhmut near Opytne (3km south of Bakhmut) and Kurdiumivka.[40] Russian milbloggers claimed that Wagner Group forces expanded their control over certain urban areas on the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut.[41] Former commander of militants in Donbas in 2014 and prominent milblogger Igor Girkin noted that this sector of the front is a \"mutual meatgrinder of attrition\" for Ukrainian and Russian troops.[42]\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations along the western outskirts of Donetsk City on January 5. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian troops attacked near Vodiane, Krasnohorivka, Vesele Marinka, and Pobieda, all ranging along the northern to southwestern outskirts of Donetsk City.[43] Russian milbloggers continued to remark on urban fighting within Marinka.[44] Geolocated footage posted on January 5 shows the aftermath of a Ukrainian strike on a base used by Chechen fighters in Marinka, indicating that Russian troops hold limited positions along the N15 Donetsk CityZaporizhzhia City highway on the southwestern outskirts of Donetsk City.[45] Russian forces did not conduct any ground attacks in western Donetsk or eastern Zaporizhia oblasts and continued routine shelling in these areas.[46]\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nRussian forces continued to operate sabotage and reconnaissance groups on the Dnipro River and reinforce positions in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast on January 5. Ukrainian Kherson Oblast Military Advisor Serhiy Khlan stated on January 4 that Russian forces are training mobilized personnel in the Henichesk area and transferring more manpower to the area.[47] The Head of the Ukrainian Joint Press Center of the Tavrisk Direction Defense Forces, Yevhen Yerin, stated on January 5 that Russian forces are primarily conducting defensive actions in Kherson Oblast, and only use small sabotage and reconnaissance groups in the Dnipro River and delta islands to probe Ukrainian defenses.[48] Russian sources claimed that Russian forces maintain positions on Velyki Potemkin Island southwest of Kherson City in the Dnipro River delta and that Ukrainian forces previously only briefly landed on the island on January 2.[49] One milblogger claimed that the islands remain contested and that it does not make sense for Russian forces to maintain positions on the islands as they cannot launch an effective amphibious operation without controlling a bridgehead to Kherson City.[50]\n\nRussian milbloggers claimed recent Russian successes in Zaporizhia Oblast on January 5, likely to distract from the slow Russian offensive around Bakhmut that may be culminating and to secure limited positions along the Zaporizhia Oblast frontline. A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces continued to expand their zone of control near Dorozhnyanka (6km south of Hulyaipole), which Russian sources claimed that Russian forces captured on December 31.[51] The milblogger claimed that Russian forces continue to probe Ukrainian defenses in the area and exposed Ukrainian positions in the forest belt east of the T0401 highway between Hulyaipole and Dorozhnyanka.[52] A different milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces do not conduct any offensive operations along the Zaporizhia Oblast frontline and lost their chance to launch an offensive near Vasylivka, Zaporizhia Oblast.[53] Russian milbloggers claimed for months that Ukrainian forces were preparing for an imminent counteroffensive in Zaporizhia Oblast.[54]\n\nUkrainian forces continued to target Russian military assets in rear areas of southern Ukraine. Odesa Military Administration Spokesperson Serhiy Bratchuk amplified reports of an explosion of an S-300 missile warehouse in Radensk, Kherson Oblast, which is within range of Ukrainian tube artillery.[55] Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official Vladimir Rogov claimed that Russian air defenses activated over Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast on January 4.[56] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) confirmed on January 4 a Ukrainian strike in Tokmak, Zaporizhia Oblast, but denied allegations that Russian forces used a hospital in Tokmak as a military facility.[57] The Russian MoD claimed the hospital strike killed a Russian military medic but otherwise did not comment on casualty counts.\n\nRussian forces continued routine fire against areas in Zaporizhia, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts on January 5.[58]\n\nThe head of Ukrainian nuclear energy agency Energoatom, Petro Kotin, stated in an interview published on January 4 that Energoatom does not believe that the International Atomic Energy Agencys (IAEA) efforts to establish a safety and security zone around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) are realistic.[59] Kotin stated that Ukrainian forces will return the ZNPP to Ukrainian control and that Russian forces would have to withdraw from the ZNPP if Ukrainian forces broke through Russian lines and captured Melitopol.[60]\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nOfficial Ukrainian sources continue to report that Russian officials are preparing for another imminent wave of mobilization in Russia and occupied territories in Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 5 that the Russian military-political leadership is taking measures to prevent Russian men from leaving the country during a new mobilization wave in January and that Russian officials are considering a complete foreign travel ban for Russian men of military age.[61] The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on January 5 that Russian forces and occupation officials are preparing for another wave of mobilization in Russian-occupied Zaporizhia Oblast.[62] The Resistance Center reported that Russian occupation officials have introduced new restrictions on movement that require residents in Berdyansk and Melitopol to obtain permission from local military commandant's offices in order to leave the cities.[63] Russian occupation officials likely introduced the measures to prevent military-age men from fleeing the upcoming wave of mobilization. ISW reported on December 31, 2022, that Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov stated that he knew \"for a fact\" that the Kremlin plans to close all Russian borders for military-age men, declare martial law, and begin another wave of mobilization in January.[64]\n\nMobilized Russian servicemembers likely continue to comprise an outsized portion of Russian military casualties in Ukraine. BBC Russian Service reported on January 2 that it has confirmed open-source data for the identities of 538 mobilized Russian servicemembers killed in Ukraine.[65] BBC Russian Service noted that real casualties among mobilized Russians servicemembers could be much higher, as many reports on Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine since October 2022 do not indicate the status of the servicemembers.[66] ISW reported on December 9, 2022, that the BBC Russian Services ongoing open-source investigation into the identities of confirmed Russian casualties with independent Russian outlet Mediazona had identified over 400 mobilized Russian personnel killed in Ukraine.[67] BBC Russian Service noted that the more than 100 confirmed Russian mobilized personnel killed in Ukraine since early December 2022 does not account for the large number of mobilized personnel that were killed in a Ukrainian strike on a Russian base in Makiivka, Donetsk Oblast on December 31, 2022.[68] The breakdown of the confirmed mobilized personnel killed in Ukraine shows that certain Russian oblasts are overrepresented, matching the pattern the BBC Russian Service has reported for all confirmed Russian servicemembers killed in Ukraine.[69] ISW assesses that the overrepresentation of certain Russian oblasts in casualty figures is partially a result of Russian force-generation efforts that have focused on specific Russian regions.[70] Shortages of professional soldiers in combat operations, poor training, and Russian commanders lack of regard for the lives of mobilized Russian personnel may also account for the recent predominance of mobilized personnel in confirmed Russian casualty figures in Ukraine.\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nRussian forces and occupation authorities are continuing to intensify filtration measures in occupied territories. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on January 5 that Russian forces are prohibiting movement within occupied Zaporizhia Oblast and are only permitting those with permits to leave occupied territories.[71] Ukrainian Kherson Oblast Administration Advisor Serhiy Khlan stated on January 5 that Russian forces are prohibiting civilians in occupied Kherson Oblast from leaving occupied territories until January 15.[72]\n\nRussian occupation authorities are continuing passportization efforts in occupied territories. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 5 that Russian occupation authorities have shortened the process to receive Russian passports in Horlivka, Donetsk Oblast, from 30 to 10 days.[73] The Ukrainian General Staff also stated on January 5 that Russian occupation authorities are continuing to forcibly passportize citizens in occupied territories and that banking institutions in Luhansk Oblast require Russian passports to issue bank cards.[74]\n\nRussian authorities are continuing to take measures to consolidate legal and administrative control of occupied territories. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed and implemented a decree (N984) to simplify procedures to allow Ukrainian collaborators to join the occupation civil service by abolishing psychological screening and personal recommendations from other civil servants.[75] The decree also provides that newly-hired collaborators may undergo medical examinations in absentia.[76] The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 5 that Russian occupation authorities in Donetsk Oblast are issuing citizens Russian license plates and drivers licenses.[77]\n\nRussian forces and occupation authorities continued to seize and repurpose civilian infrastructure to support Russian military activities in occupied territories on January 5. Luhansk Oblast Head Serhiy Haidai stated on January 5 that Russian forces coerced farmers in Bilovodsk, Luhansk Oblast to abandon their hangers in order to accommodate Russian servicemen and personnel.[78] Haidai also stated that Russian occupation authorities are continuing to seize and repurpose civilian hospitals to treat Russian and Wagner Group servicemen throughout Luhansk Oblast.[79]\n\nRussian occupation authorities are continuing to take measures to incentivize Ukrainian citizens to move to occupied territories. Russian officials passed a resolution on January 3 on the provision of a two percent rate on mortgage loans for residents in occupied territories.[80] Kherson Occupation Administration Head Vladimir Saldo stated on January 5 that the new planned city on the Arabat Spit will need new residents and that preferential mortgages will make housing there much more affordable.[81] Russian occupation authorities likely seek to increase the population in the deep rear in occupied territories to strengthen production capabilities and support logistics related to Russias invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussian occupation authorities continued making efforts to consolidate economic control of occupied territories on January 5. Ukrainian Kherson Oblast Administration Advisor Serhiy Khlan reported on January 5 that Russian occupation officials are allowing Ukrainian civilians to exchange the Ukrainian hryvnia for Russian rubles at select banks in occupied Kherson Oblast in accordance with proposed rates.[82]\n\nRussian forces and occupation authorities are continuing to take measures to identify possible partisans in occupied territories. Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov stated on January 5 that Russian forces conceal themselves in civilian clothing before entering supermarkets and other public places in Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast, in an effort to identify possible partisans.[83]\n\nISW will continue to report daily observed indicators consistent with the current assessed most dangerous course of action (MDCOA): a renewed invasion of northern Ukraine possibly aimed at Kyiv.\n\nISWs December 15 MDCOA warning forecast about a potential Russian offensive against northern Ukraine in winter 2023 remains a worst-case scenario within the forecast cone. ISW currently assesses the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine from Belarus as low, but possible, and the risk of Belarusian direct involvement as very low. This new section in the daily update is not in itself a forecast or assessment. It lays out the daily observed indicators we are using to refine our assessments and forecasts, which we expect to update regularly. Our assessment that the MDCOA remains unlikely has not changed. We will update this header if the assessment changes.\n\nObserved indicators for the MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nNothing significant to report.\n\nObserved ambiguous indicators for MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nThe Belarusian Ministry of Defense stated on January 5 that Russia will continue deploying Russian forces to Belarus and will conduct combat exercises with Belarusian forces within the context of the combined RussianBelarusian Regional Grouping of Forces (RGV).[84]\n\nBelarus State Border Committee accused Ukrainian forces of engaging in \"provocations\" on the Ukraine-Belarusian border by aiming weapons at Belarusian border guards at the Poddobryanka checkpoint (between Chernihiv and Gomel oblasts) on January 5.[85]\n\nObserved counter-indicators for the MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nReuters National Security Correspondent covering the Pentagon Idrees Ali reported on January 5 that the Pentagon assesses there are no indications that Russia intends to use Belarus as a new front in the war in Ukraine.[86]\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff reiterated that it has not observed Russian forces in Belarus forming a strike group as of January 5.[87]\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

                "cc_text": "Some give little warning before they strike. Others produce a sound likened to a rocket, a screeching motor or an artillery strike, a herald to the destruction that follows.\n\nDrones have been in use since the First World War, with the first models radio-controlled for gunnery practice. In the 1950s, the U.S. Air Force developed the Model 147, which flew missions over Vietnam for photo reconnaissance. The Soviets followed suit, with preliminary models launched in 1974.\n\nThe Predator drone became a symbol of the American forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, which followed by the hunter-killer successor, the Reaper. It was Reaper drones that were alleged to have killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in January 2020.\n\nDrone warfare has also been a calling card of the invasion of Ukraine, with the autonomous aerial vehicles being used on both sides of the conflict to devastating effect.\n\nWhile some analysts have claimed that Ukraine is the staging ground for the first \"full-scale drone conflict,\" video from the 2020 outbreak of the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia was a preview of what to expect on future battlefields involving drones, and before that, drone operations were prevalent in clashes including those in Yemen, Syria and Libya.\n\n\"What makes Libya slightly different is that it was essentially multiple non-state actors backed by foreign parties. Here, in the case of Russia and Ukraine, you have organized militaries in an interstate war throwing drones at each other,\" said drone expert and professor at Rutgers University Michael Boyle in a recent interview with CTV News.\n\n\"Thats one of the reasons why you're seeing such interest from outside Russia and Ukraine, looking at how this is playing out,\" he continued. \"Because a lot of states see this as a potential test run for what it might look like if they had an interstate war, for example, over Taiwan, or in any other theatre against Russia.\n\n\"They're looking at this as the first time two state actors (are) equipped with reasonably competent drone fleets, versus just throwing them at each other and seeing what's happening.\"\n\nUkraine experienced a bloody beginning to the new year, with a massive drone assault over the weekend killing four and wounding dozens of others. The Ukrainian military said it shot down 45 Shahed-136 drones overnight, a report CTV News is unable to independently verify.\n\nRussia claimed to be targeting Ukrainian drone-production facilities.\n\nAs fighting on the ground on parts of the frontline grinds to a halt in deep winter conditions, or in cases of close-quarters combat seen in Bakhmut, victory and survival may hinge on who has the most advanced weapons and credible intelligence both acquired with drones.\n\nEYES IN THE SKY OR DROPPING DEATH BELOW\n\nSince Russias invasion almost one year ago, the battlefield has seen several different types and classes of drones in use. Some can be disabled in a \"hard kill\" method, such as shooting it down; others in a \"soft kill\" by using electronic warfare to disable internal software.\n\nBoyle said militaries will prioritize the soft kills in order to inspect the machine and trace its internal parts.\n\n\"You can trace the supply network back, and that actually gives you pressure points For example, we know Russian drones are getting parts from Hong Kong, so now how do we pressure those companies in order to make it hard for them to be able to buy drones?\" he said.\n\nBoyle said it may be helpful to categorize drones in surveillance and reconnaissance versus tactical strikes, as well as if they are short-, medium- or long-range.\n\nNational Police officers shooting down an Iranian drone.\n\nWE NEED AIR DEFENSE! pic.twitter.com/AvdviH6RhE Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) October 17, 2022\n\nCTV News cannot independently verify the content of this video\n\nONE-WAY TICKETS\n\nA drone is seen in the sky seconds before it fired on buildings in Kyiv, Ukraine, Monday, Oct. 17, 2022. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)\n\nSHAHED-136\n\nThe Iranian-made Shahed-136 has become synonymous with the war in Ukraine, and is colloquially called a \"kamikaze drone\" or \"one-way attack munition\" due to its ability to self-destruct into a particular target.\n\nIn technical terms, the Shahed-136, like other similar machines is what is known as a \"loitering munition,\" but due to its rather cheap design, the Shahed-136 is more like a low-cost long-range cruise missile, according to drone industry insiders, independently verified by CTV News, who spoke on the condition of anonymity\n\nThe sound of the Shahed-136 is distinct, like a screech of a motorcycle or chainsaw engine. It was first revealed by Iran in 2021, and supplied to the Houthis in Yemen to be used against Saudi Arabia. The Shahed-136 can be fired off the back of a truck from a rocket-propelled stack in groups up to five which can overwhelm air defence systems.\n\nThe Shahed-136 flies low and slow, which allows it to evade air defences, and its construction and materials means it is hard to detect and track by radar.\n\nAt around 3.4 metres long, weighing more than 180 kilograms and with a wingspan of 2.4 metres, the Shahed-136 is a larger machine, and can fly at 185 km/h with a range of 1,000-plus kilometres\n\nThe explosive power of the Shahed-136 is about 10 times that of a regular artillery strike, making it an extremely devastating weapon.\n\nA launch of the Switchblade 600 (AeronVironment Inc.)\n\nSWITCHBLADE 300 AND 600\n\nIn March and April this past year, the U.S. sent more than 700 Switchblade drones as part of its aid packages. Made by AeroVironment, the Switchblade 300 and 600 contain warheads to detonate on impact.\n\nThe 300 is intended to kill combatants in the open or passengers in an armoured vehicle. Its a lightweight machine weighing 2.5 kilograms, with a wingspan of 69 centimetres and a flight range of 10 kilometres.\n\nIt uses a colour camera that feeds data to the operator and a GPS system for precise strikes. The 300 contains an explosive charge equivalent to a 40-millimetre hand grenade. It can fly missions up to 15 minutes.\n\nThe 600 is intended for larger anti-tank strikes, and can be fitted with an anti-tank warhead to pierce armour. The 600 is larger than the 300, weighing 23 kilograms with a flight range of 40 kilometres and can fly missions up to 40 minutes.\n\nBoth the Switchblade 300 and 600 are highly portable and can be fired from a tube on the ground, making it simple to use in fighting hot zones. Soldiers can deploy the drones and quickly move on to a new position.\n\nTACTICAL SURVEILLANCE\n\nA Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drone is seen during a rehearsal of a military parade dedicated to Independence Day in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, Aug. 20, 2021. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)\n\nBAYRAKTAR TB2\n\nThe Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drone is meant for combat reconnaissance and precision strikes. The machine known as a medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) drone has a 12-metre wingspan and is 6.5 metres long, making it easier to spot.\n\nThe drone weighs 700 kilograms and can carry a payload (explosives) of an added 150 kilograms. The most common payloads of Bayraktar TB2s are laser- or GPS-guided lightweight munitions.\n\nA remote video terminal operated by a soldier in the field sends data to a ground control station, manned by a pilot, payload operator and a commander. The unit can control three Bayraktars simultaneously.\n\nWith a price tag of approximately $5 million USD, the Bayraktar TB2 is relatively cheap compared to other options. The priciest component of the drone is the infrared camera, made by L3 Wescam, a company headquartered in Hamilton, Ont.\n\nThe Bayraktar TB2 was a core part of the initial assault in February, but as Russian air defences improved, the majority of them were shot down.\n\nThis handout photo taken from video released by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Monday, Aug. 8, 2022, shows a Russian serviceman preparing a Orlan-10 reconnaissance drone to launch at an undisclosed location. (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service photo via AP)\n\nORLAN 10\n\nThe Russian-made Orlan 10 is also a medium-range drone that is a workhorse. It can be used for reconnaissance, search and rescue, observation, monitoring, target tracking, strikes and jamming signals in the area in which it flies.\n\nIt was revealed in 2016 and relies on many foreign-sourced parts, including Japanese cameras.\n\nWith the sanctions placed on Russia since the beginning of the invasion, sourcing parts to build and repair Orlan 10s has been limited.\n\nWith a wingspan of three metres and length of two metres, the Orlan 10 is a smaller drone that has a daylight and thermal imaging camera, along with a video and radio transmitter.\n\nIt can be fitted with cellular or Wi-Fi signal jammers to create dead zones, has a mission time of 18 hours and can withstand extreme weather, including temperatures as low as -30 C.\n\nLike the Bayraktar, the Orlan 10 flies low and slow, resulting in hundreds of the drones being shot down since the war began.\n\nOFF THE SHELF\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman flies a drone during an operation against Russian positions at an undisclosed location in the Donetsk region, Ukraine, Sunday, Dec. 4, 2022. (AP Photo/Roman Chop)\n\nDJI MAVIC SERIES\n\nAnother staple of the Ukrainian war effort has been commercially available drones either rigged to carry small, handmade explosives or used for observation and scouting.\n\nA popular model is the Mavic line from Chinese technology company DJI, based in Shenzen.\n\nWith a 4K camera, seven-kilometre range and mission flight time of 27 minutes, the Mavic is an easy-to-use machine that can fly up to 64 km/h.\n\nWhile the ease with which it can be controlled by a cellphone or through a Wi-Fi signal is a plus for Ukrainian troops forced to be adaptable on the battlefield, the Mavic also can easily be jammed or spoofed.\n\nMany are lost, damaged or broken on their first flight, but with a price tag in the low thousands, it has quickly become a focus point for crowdfunding and charity initiatives.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense included DJI on a blacklist this year because of the companys alleged ties to the Chinese military, noting potential security risks stemming from the drones collecting of vast amounts of sensitive data from infrastructure images to sensor readings of body temperature and personal information from users' smartphones and the fact that DJI customers must use company software that may have privacy pitfalls.\n\nOleg flies a drone while testing it on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, June 8, 2022.

Sutton observed that it was likely propelled by a recreational water jet that bore almost identical markers of a Sea-Doo, made by Quebec-based Bombardier Recreational Products.\n\nThe company said it played no part in creating the Ukrainian vessel.\n\nRussia claimed the aerial drones used in the Sevastopol attack also used parts manufactured in Canada, but provided no evidence.\n\nA national flag can be seen in front of Ukraine's the Motherland Monument in Kyiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022.

As soon as it became clear to the Russian command that Ukraine was not going to fall into their laps in the way that had been envisaged in the Kremlin, they reverted to classic, old-style brute force tactics,\" Giles said in an interview with CTV News.\n\n\"The current iteration that we have of Russia's tactics, the attacks on critical civilian infrastructure in Ukraine in order to remove everything that sustains life in Ukraine and trigger a humanitarian catastrophe, is actually straight from the Russian manual.\"\n\nGiles said the tactics and strategic operation of destruction Russia is employing in Ukraine is an attempt to replicate \"on a much larger scale\" the tactics that it found \"successful\" in Syria.\n\n\"If you simply make life impossible for the civilian population, then sooner or later your adversary has to quit because they are no longer in a position to wage war,\" he said.\n\nBoyle agreed.\n\n\"I think what's actually happened is that the war has shifted towards a strategy of mutual hurt,\" he said. \"It has been a strategy of, We're not going to win this on the battlefield in direct capturing of territory.\"\n\nUkraines adaptability on the battlefield is also exemplified in it uses its drones, compared to Russia's strategies.\n\nSpeaking on the U.S. supplying Ukraine with the Switchblade model of drone, Boyle said the way Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyys forces are using them is \"interesting.\"\n\n\"Theyve been quite literally picking off the leadership (of the Russian military) with Switchblade drones, which is a very interesting way of degrading your enemies capacity,\" he said.\n\nUkraine also revealed its capabilities for long-range strikes when it hit air bases inside Russia with Soviet-era modified drones in December, killing at least three soldiers, injuring four and damaging two long-range bombers.\n\nThe drones were likely Tupolev Tu-141s, last used by the Soviet air force on the front line for photo reconnaissance, pulled out of storage, outfitted with explosives and sent on a one-way mission into Russia, according drone industry insiders, independently verified by CTV News, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine has also set up aerial reconnaissance units called \"Ochi,\" which means \"eyes\" in Ukrainian, meant to spot Russian aircraft and artillery.\n\nThe Ochi units can be the difference of life or death in close combat.\n\n\"Ukraine has adopted flexibility because of necessity,\" Giles said. \"Because if you do not have a choice in a war of survival, then yes, you adopt the best means possible and never mind procedure or doctrine.\"\n\nAs for Russia, Giles does not mince words on its efforts on the battlefield.\n\n\"What we've seen in Ukraine in the very early stages of the campaign is the thin crust of competence and modernity of the Russian forces breaking away,\" he said. \"And underneath it, it seems we have the same old seething morass of corruption and backwardness.\"",

All times EST.\n\n11:20 a.m.:\n\n11:10 a.m.: Estonia wants to outline a plan by the end of January for seizing some $21.4 million of Russian assets and delivering them under European Union sanctions to Ukraine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nEstonian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mihkel Tamm said on January 10 that the Baltic state had started working on the proposal last month.\n\nThe announcement comes as the European Commission is developing a bloc-wide arrangement to deal with $322 billion in Russian central-bank reserves and billions in frozen assets of Russian nationals sanctioned over Moscows invasion of Ukraine.\n\n10:55 a.m.: The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on Tuesday released data showing that donors contributed $327 million in 2022 to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund.\n\n10:40 a.m.: The CEO of energy company Uniper has decided to step down after the German government nationalized the gas supplier last month, Uniper said Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.\n\nKlaus-Dieter Maubach is exercising a special right to terminate his contract and will leave the board this year, Uniper said in a statement. It added that Maubach, who has led the company since March 2021, was willing to stay in the job until a suitable replacement is appointed.\n\nThe German government announced its plan to nationalize Uniper in September, expanding state intervention in the energy sector to prevent a shortage resulting from Russias war in Ukraine.\n\nBefore the invasion of Ukraine, the company bought about half of its gas from Russia, which started cutting deliveries to Germany in June and hasnt supplied any gas to the country since the end of August.\n\nUniper has incurred huge costs as a result of those cuts because it was forced to buy gas at far higher market prices to meet its supply contract obligations.\n\n10:15 a.m.:\n\n9:35 a.m.: Europe has dodged an energy apocalypse this winter, economists and officials say, thanks to unusually warm weather and efforts to find other sources of natural gas after Russia cut off most of its supply to the continent.\n\nNatural gas suppliers in recent days have increased their stocks at a time when theyre usually being drawn down an unexpected boost that has relieved fears of gas used to heat homes, generate electricity and power factories running out by winters end.\n\nAs a result, short-term gas prices have fallen from record highs, dropping from 18 times what they were before Russia massed troops on Ukraines border in early 2021 to four times higher. Thats still painfully high, eating away at company earnings and consumer spending power through costly utility bills and inflation.\n\nBut analysts say the worst case of shortages and rationing has been avoided.\n\nThe Associated Press published key facts about Europes energy struggles in this report\n\n9:10 a.m.:\n\n11:30 p.m.: Ukrainian forces repelled an earlier attempt to take the town but a large number of Wagner Group units quickly returned, deploying new tactics and more soldiers under heavy artillery cover, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar said on Monday on the Telegram messaging app, according to Reuters.\n\n\"The enemy literally step[s] over the corpses of their own soldiers, using massed artillery, MLRS systems and mortars,\" Malyar said.\n\n10:30 p.m.:\n\n9:50 p.m.: A Ukrainian couple heard their son's voice off-camera on a video showing soldiers captured by Russian forces in Mariupol. They have been searching for him since he sent a final message on May 17, the day troops defending the Azovstal steelworks surrendered. He is one of many Ukrainians believed to be in Russian custody whose fate is unknown. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n8:38 p.m.:\n\n7:54 p.m.: Britain on Monday scaled back its energy bill support for businesses after warning that the current aid level was unsustainable, Reuters reported.\n\nThe government is currently subsidizing energy costs to protect consumers and firms after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, a key gas supplier, caused prices to soar.\n\nFinance minister Jeremy Hunt announced Monday that the support for businesses, due to expire in late March, would be overhauled and extended by one year until March 2024.\n\n6:59 p.m.: Vengeance From Above: Ukraine's Aging Helicopters Punish Russian Positions: Soviet-era helicopters have been providing close air support for Ukraine's troops as they seek out Russian positions on the front line near Kherson.

The effects of trauma from the war with Russia vary widely, with an estimated 75% of Ukrainian kids suffering from psychological damage. Current Time's Borys Sachalko talked with three students who have been through differing challenges to see how they're faring. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n3:18 p.m.: The U.S. would risk enabling the spread of extremism in Europe if it stopped providing support to Ukraine in its war with Russia, Maines independent senator said Monday in the wake of meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, The Associated Press reported.\n\nSens. Angus King of Maine and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, who sit on the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, traveled to Kyiv last week to meet with Zelenskyy. King said he came back more certain that U.S. aid to Ukraine is vital.\n\nUkraine is slated to receive $44.9 billion in U.S. aid as part of the recent government spending bill. The U.S. should continue supporting Ukraine until Russian President Vladimir Putin is out of power, King said. He characterized Putin as \"a dictator.\"\n\nFailure to continue supporting Ukraine would be akin to Western nations failure to combat the rise of Germany in the 1930s, King said. He said he plans to make that case to constituents and Republican lawmakers who have voiced skepticism of continued U.S. involvement in the war.\n\n\"I get letters every now and then, people saying, Why are we doing this? Ukraines far away. Its not our fight. Well, it is our fight, because if we dont fight it now, it will spread,\" King said. \"And it will become something that we cant avoid being involved in, just as occurred in the late 1930s at the beginning of World War II.\"\n\n2:30 p.m.: Ukrainian police said on Monday they were looking for two British voluntary workers who had gone missing in east Ukraine, the scene of heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces, Reuters reported.\n\nA police statement named the two as Andrew Bagshaw and Christopher Parry and said in a statement they were trying to establish their whereabouts.\n\nThe police said the two left the city of Kramatorsk for the town of Soledar on Friday morning and were reported missing on Saturday evening after contact with them was lost. The police statement said they were aged 28 and 48 but gave no details of their voluntary work.\n\nKramatorsk is about 80 km (50 miles) from Soledar, where Ukraine's military says fighting is particularly intense.\n\n\"We are supporting the families of two British men who have gone missing in Ukraine,\" Britain's foreign office said.\n\n2:05 p.m.:\n\n1:45 p.m.: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is starting Monday a weeklong trip to Europe and North America Monday in Paris where he will hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on key global issues, including the war in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMacron and Kishidas talks come as Japan is leading the Group of Seven most advanced economies and is preparing the next G-7 summit scheduled in May in Hiroshima.\n\nCentral to discussions between Macron and Kishida will be the war in Ukraine and the response to Russian aggression, according to the Elysee.\n\nKishidas five nation-tour will also take him Italy, Britain, Canada and the U.S. where he will have talks Friday with President Joe Biden.\n\nJapan in December adopted key security and defense reforms, including a counterstrike capability that breaks from an exclusively self-defense-only postwar principle.\n\n1:15 p.m.:\n\n12:55 p.m.: The Russian and Ukrainian human rights commissioners will meet in Turkey this week, news agencies from both countries reported on Monday, for talks likely to include the possibility of further exchanges of prisoners of war, Reuters reported.\n\nInterfax quoted the Russian commissioner, Tatiana Moskalkova, as saying the meeting with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Lubinets would take place during an international forum in Turkey between Thursday and Saturday.\n\nShe said there had already been discussion of the \"approximate agenda of our negotiations\", but gave no details.\n\nUkraine's Ukrinform news agency quoted Lubinets as saying the main issue was \"the return of our heroes and heroines\", a reference to prisoner exchanges.\n\n12:25 p.m.:\n\n12:05 p.m.: Officials at a vocational school in an eastern Ukraine city dismissed claims by Russia that hundreds of Ukrainian troops were killed in a missile strike there, saying Monday that a rocket merely blew out windows and damaged classrooms, The Associated Press reported.\n\nRussia specifically named the vocational school in Kramatorsk as the target of an attack in the almost 11-month war. The Russian Defense Ministry said its missiles hit two temporary bases housing 1,300 Ukrainian troops in the city, killing 600 of them, late Saturday.\n\nAssociated Press reporters visiting the scene in sunny weather Monday saw a four-story concrete building with most of its windows blown out. Inside, locals were cleaning up debris, sweeping up broken glass and hurling broken furniture out into a missile crater below.\n\nA separate, six-story school building was largely undamaged. There were neither signs of a Ukrainian military presence nor any casualties.\n\nYana Pristupa, the schools deputy director, scoffed at Moscows claims of hitting a troop concentration. \"Nobody saw a single spot of blood anywhere,\" she told the AP. \"Everyone saw yesterday that no one carried out any bodies. Its just people cleaning up.\"\n\n11:30 a.m.:\n\n10:50 a.m.: Russia on Monday opted out of a European convention on fighting corruption, a move that comes in the wake of its withdrawal from the Council of Europe following start of Moscows military action in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin asked the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, to terminate adherence to the Council of Europes convention on fighting corruption that Russia signed in 1999. The date for a vote on termination hasnt been set yet, but its expected to come soon.\n\nPutin argued in his letter to the Duma that the opt-out was the result of the Councils decision to restrict Moscows participation in a body charged with overseeing general compliance with the convention, something he called \"unacceptable\" and \"discriminatory.\"\n\nThe Council of Europe, the continents top human rights organization, suspended Russias participation shortly after it sent troops into Ukraine on February 24. Russia withdrew from the Council in March and warned that it will also opt out of conventions that it signed as part of its membership in the organization. Moscow backed out of the European Convention on Human Rights in September.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russias withdrawal from the anti-corruption convention wouldnt hinder official efforts to combat graft.\n\n10:35 a.m.:\n\n10:10 a.m.: Britain is considering supplying Ukraine with tanks for the first time to help the country fight Russian forces, Sky News reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources.\n\nDiscussions have been taking place \"for a few weeks\" about delivering the British Army's Challenger 2 main battle tank to Ukraine, Sky said, quoting a Western source with knowledge of the conversations.\n\nSupplying tanks would represent a significant step-up in Western support to Ukraine, but the British government has not yet taken a final decision on the matter, the report added.\n\nSky cited one unnamed source saying Britain could offer around 10 Challenger 2 tanks.\n\nThe Challenger 2 is a battle tank designed to attack other tanks, and has been in service with the British army since 1994. It has been deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Iraq, according to the British army.\n\n9:50 a.m.:\n\n9:20 a.m.: Kyiv expects the European Union to include Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom in its next round of sanctions over the war in Ukraine, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday, according to Reuters.\n\nShmyhal said after talks in Kyiv with Frans Timmermans, a vice-president of the European Union's executive European Commission, that Russia's nuclear energy industry should be punished over the invasion of Ukraine more than 10 months ago.\n\nRussia has occupied the Zaporizhzia nuclear power station in southeastern Ukraine since last March and President Vladimir Putin issued a decree last October transferring control of the plant from Ukrainian nuclear energy company Energoatom to a subsidiary of Rosatom. Kyiv says the move amounts to theft.\n\n\"We are actively working with our European partners on providing support in four areas: demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, supply of electrical equipment, opportunities to import electricity from the EU, and sanctions against Russia,\" Shmyhal wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n8:55 a.m.: Norway's oil output is expected to rise by 6.9% this year as the huge Johan Sverdrup field ramps up production while gas volumes are predicted to remain unchanged near record highs, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) said on Monday, Reuters reported. Norway last year overtook Russia as Europe's biggest gas supplier, with Equinor the top exporter, after Russia's Gazprom cut off much of the gas on which Europe previously depended.\n\n8:25 a.m.: Sweden and the United States have begun negotiations to form deeper security ties in the form of a defense cooperation agreement (DCA), the Swedish government said in a statement on Monday, according to Reuters.\n\nA DCA will create a legal framework for the presence of U.S. forces in Sweden and enables an even closer bilateral cooperation than facilitated by NATO membership, the Swedish defense ministry said.\n\n\"The United States is Swedens most important security and defense partner, both bilaterally and within NATO,\" the ministry said.\n\nSweden in May applied alongside Finland to join NATO in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine, but the application is still awaiting the approval of members Hungary and Turkey.\n\n8:10 a.m.:\n\n7:50 a.m.: Ukraine said it was strengthening its forces around Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region and repelling constant attacks there by Russian mercenary group Wagner, whose leader has vowed to capture the area's vast underground mines, Reuters reported.\n\nKyiv had sent reinforcements to Soledar, a small town near Bakhmut where the situation was particularly difficult, Ukrainian officials said.\n\n\"The enemy again made a desperate attempt to storm the city of Soledar from different directions and threw the most professional units of the Wagnerites into battle,\" Ukraine's military said in a statement.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner mercenary group, has been trying to capture Bakhmut and Soledar for months at the cost of many lives on both sides. He said on Saturday its significance lay in the network of mines there.\n\n7:35 a.m.:\n\n7:20 a.m.: Russian actor Artur Smolyaninov faces criminal charges in his home country after allegedly making \"anti-Russian\" comments in a newspaper interview, Reuters reported Monday, citing investigators.\n\nSmolyaninov, who starred in the 2005 film \"The 9th Company\" about the Soviet Union's ill-fated military campaign in Afghanistan, said in an interview last week that he would fight for Ukraine, not Russia, if he had to take part in the conflict.\n\nSmolyaninov said last October that he was no longer living in Russia.\n\nHis comments made in an interview for Novaya Gazeta Europe, a newspaper now banned in Russia drew condemnation from members of the Russian parliament, one of whom said the actor should be barred from all state-contracted films.\n\n\"For my part, I will appeal to the Investigative Committee with a request to initiate a criminal case against this traitor,\" lawmaker Biysultan Khamzaev told the RIA news agency.\n\nThe Investigative Committee said on Monday it had launched a criminal case against Smolyaninov after he took part in an interview with a \"Western publication,\" but did not provide further details.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, dozens of actors and artists have fled abroad in fear of breaching the country's tough new laws on spreading \"misinformation\" about the war in Ukraine or discrediting the Russian army.\n\nMoscow calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special military operation\" designed to demilitarize and \"denazify\" the country. Kyiv and its Western allies cast the invasion as an unprovoked act of aggression aimed at seizing territory.\n\n7:05 a.m.: Three women from Ukraine, Iran, and Turkey have won Sweden's Olof Palme human rights prize in 2023 for championing women's rights and freedoms, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nMarta Chumalo of Ukraine, Iran's Narges Mohammadi, and Eren Keskin of Turkey were honored for \"their efforts in the fight to secure women's freedom, in an age when human rights are threatened by war, violence and oppression,\" the Olof Palme Memorial Fund said in a statement.\n\nAn award ceremony will be held in Stockholm on February 1.\n\n6:50 a.m.:\n\n6:30 a.m.: Germany has no current plans to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, a government spokesperson told a regular briefing on Monday.\n\nGermany last week announced it was sending Marder fighting vehicles to Kyiv, answering calls for more heavy weapons to repel Russian forces, Reuters reported. Germany's economy minister also said Berlin cannot rule out the delivery of the Leopard tanks, which are heavier fighting vehicles than the Marders.\n\n6:15 a.m.: The Kremlin said on Monday that new deliveries of Western weapons to Kyiv would \"deepen the suffering of the Ukrainian people\" and would not change the course of the conflict, Reuters reported.\n\n\"This supply will not be able to change anything,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a daily briefing.\n\nUkraine, which has scored some battlefield successes since Russian forces invaded last February, has asked Western allies for heavier weapons and air defenses as it seeks to tip the balance of the 10-month long conflict in its favor.\n\n6:00 a.m.: The Kremlin on Monday rejected a Ukrainian assertion that a senior Russian official has been floating the idea of a potential peace deal over Ukraine with European officials, Reuters reported.\n\nOleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told the country's public broadcaster on Thursday that Dmitry Kozak, deputy head of Russia's presidential administration, had been holding meetings with European officials in an attempt to force Kyiv to sign what he characterized as an unfavorable peace deal.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked about Danilov's assertion, said it was \"another fake.\"\n\n5:45 a.m.:\n\n5:30 a.m.: According to Reuters, the Kremlin said on Monday that it was confident its defense ministry was correct when it said that 600 Ukrainian servicemen had been \"destroyed\" in an attack on the city of Kramatorsk, despite reporting which showed the attack missed its target.\n\n\"The Kremlin has absolute confidence, I would like to remind you of the President's words that the main source of information is the Ministry of Defense,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a daily briefing.\n\nA Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk missed its targets and there were no obvious signs of casualties, a Reuters reporter said on Sunday, after Moscow claimed the strike had killed 600 Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n5 a.m.: Pope Francis on Monday said wars like the one in Ukraine where civilian areas are subjected to what he called indiscriminate destruction are \"a crime against God and humanity.\"\n\nReuters reported that Francis made his remarks in his yearly speech to diplomats accredited to the Vatican, an overview of the world situation which has come to be known informally as his \"state of the world\" address.\n\nFrancis spoke of \"the war in Ukraine, with its wake of death and destruction, with its attacks on civil infrastructures that cause lives to be lost not only from gunfire and acts of violence, but also from hunger and freezing cold.\"\n\nHe then immediately quoted from a Vatican constitution, saying \"every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God and humanity which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation.\"\n\nReferring to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, he said: \"Sadly, today too, the nuclear threat is raised, and the world once more feels fear and anguish.\"\n\nHe repeated his appeal for a total ban on nuclear weapons, saying even their possession for reasons of deterrence is \"immoral.\"\n\n4:30 a.m.: A 60-year-old woman was killed and several other people were wounded in a Russian missile strike on a market in the village of Shevchenkove in eastern Ukraine on Monday, the regional governor said according to Reuters.\n\nFootage posed by public broadcaster Suspilne on the Telegram messaging app showed rescue workers sifting through large piles of rubble, burning wreckage and a large crater in what it said was Shevchenkove, southeast of the regional capital Kharkiv.\n\n\"According to confirmed information, unfortunately a 60-year-old woman died,\" Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, wrote on Telegram.\n\n\"All other victims were hospitalized. Doctors are helping them. Rescuer workers continue to clear the debris.\"\n\nHe had said earlier that at least seven people had been wounded, including a 13-year-old girl. The reports could not immediately be verified independently by Reuters.\n\nSuspilne quoted a local official as saying at least three pavilions were destroyed in the attack and that a shopping center was damaged, but that Monday was not a market day.\n\nRussia, which invaded Ukraine more than 10 months ago, did not immediately comment on the reported attack.\n\n4 a.m.: Shipping traffic in the Suez Canal was proceeding normally on Monday after tugs towed a cargo vessel that broke down during its passage through the waterway, Reuters reported the Canal Authority as saying.\n\nThe breakdown was expected to cause only minor delays, with convoys of ships resuming regular transit by 11:00 local time (09:00 GMT), shipping agent Leth said.\n\nThe M/V Glory, which was sailing to China, suffered a technical fault when it was 38km into its passage southward through the canal, before being towed by four tugs to a repair area, the Suez Canal Authority said in a statement.\n\nIt departed Ukraine's Chornomorsk port on December 25 bound for China with 65,970 metric tons of corn, according to the Istanbul-based Joint Coordination Centre, or JCC, overseeing Ukraine grain exports.\n\nThe JCC, which includes representatives from the United Nations, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia, said the ship had been cleared to carry on its journey from Istanbul after an inspection on January 3.\n\n3:30 a.m.:\n\n3 a.m.:\n\n2:30 a.m.: The ongoing war in Ukraine is cited as one of the factors that four out of ten German companies are expecting business to shrink in 2023, a survey by the German Economic Institute (IW) showed on Monday. Other factors include high energy costs and supply chain issues.\n\n\"The risk of a gas shortage in the 2022/23 winter season is no longer as present as it was in the summer of 2022, and energy prices have also retreated since then. However, they remain at a high level and production disruptions cannot be ruled out,\" the IW said in the survey seen by Reuters. \"Moreover, it will only become clear in the course of 2023 how extensive gas and energy supply can be built up for the next winter and the extent of any possible disruptions that could occur in 2023.\"\n\nThe survey of around 2,500 companies showed that around a third of companies expect output to stagnate and the remaining quarter predict business will grow. Germany's economy, Europe's largest, is forecast to shrink by 0.3% next year, the most among G-7 nations, according to the International Monetary Fund, hit by a sudden halt of gas flows from Russia, its former main supplier.\n\nThe outlook is particularly bleak in the German construction sector, where more than half of companies surveyed by IW expect a decline in production and just 15% anticipate more business. The picture is barely brighter in industry, where 39% of surveyed companies forecast a decline, driven by a cautious assessment in the consumer and basic industries.\n\n2 a.m.:\n\n1:30 a.m.:\n\n1 a.m.: Russia's government extended support to a legislative amendment that would classify maps that dispute the country's official \"territorial integrity\" as punishable extremist materials, Reuters cited the state-owned TASS news agency as reporting on Sunday.\n\nThe amendment to Russia's anti-extremism legislation stipulates that \"cartographic and other documents and images that dispute the territorial integrity of Russia\" will be classified as extremist materials, the agency reported.\n\nRussia's sweepingly ambiguous anti-extremism legislation it applies to religious organizations, journalists and their materials, as well as the activity of businesses, among others has allowed the Kremlin to tighten its grip on opponents.\n\nThe new amendment, TASS reports without citing sources, emerged after its authors pointed out that some maps distributed in Russia dispute the \"territorial affiliation\" of the Crimean Peninsula and the Kuril Islands.\n\nRussia annexed Ukraine's Crimea in 2014 a move rejected by Ukraine and many countries as illegal. Ukrainians and their government have since often objected to world maps showing Crimea as part of Russia's territory.\n\nRussia and Japan have not formally ended World War Two hostilities because of their standoff over a group of islands just off Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido. The Soviet Union seized those islands known in Russia as the Kurils and in Japan as the Northern Territories at the end of the war.\n\nThe amendment must be proposed to the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, and after a review go through three readings. It is then sent to the Federation Council, the upper house, and to President Vladimir Putin for signing.\n\nSeparately, Russian politicians began debating punishment for Russians who oppose the war in Ukraine and who, as the former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said, \"wish their fatherland to perish.\"\n\nMedvedev, one of the most forthright allies of Putin, said that \"in times of war,\" there are special rules that allow to deal with traitors.\n\n\"In times of war, there have always been such special rules,\" Medvedev said on the Telegram messaging app. \"And quiet groups of impeccably inconspicuous people who effectively execute the rules.\"\n\nMedvedev's rhetoric has become increasingly vitriolic since the war in Ukraine began, though his published views sometimes chime with thinking at the top levels of the Kremlin elite.\n\n12:30 a.m.:\n\n12:01 a.m.: Ukrainian forces are repelling constant attacks on the town of Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region and holding their positions in nearby Soledar in very difficult conditions, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Bakhmut is holding on despite everything. And even though most of the town has been destroyed by Russian strikes, our soldiers are repelling constant Russian attempts to advance,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.\n\n\"Soledar is holding on, even though there is even greater destruction and things are very difficult.\"\n\nZelenskyy issued a fresh denunciation of what he said was Russia's failure to observe a truce it had proclaimed for Orthodox Christmas by staging attacks on Ukrainian cities.\n\n\"Russians were shelling Kherson with incendiary ammunition immediately after Christmas,\" he said, referring to a city in the south abandoned by Russian forces in November.\n\n\"Strikes on Kramatorsk and other cities in Donbas - on civilian targets and at the very time when Moscow was reporting a supposed 'silence' for its army.\"\n\nRussia said on Sunday that a missile attack on Kramatorsk, northwest of Bakhmut, had killed 600 Ukrainian soldiers, but a Reuters reporter at the scene found no obvious signs of casualties.\n\nSome information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.",

                "cc_text": "Makiivka: Russia points fingers after deadliest Ukraine attack\n\nBy Paul Kirby BBC News\n\nReuters\n\nLocal military commander's wife Yekaterina Kolotovkina was among mourners in the centre of Samara\n\nThe deaths of dozens of Russian soldiers in a new year missile strike on a building in occupied eastern Ukraine have prompted recriminations among critics of the Russian military.\n\nRussia's defence ministry has so far conceded that 89 people were killed in the Ukrainian attack on Makiivka at around midnight on New Year's Eve.\n\nOne commander's wife accused the West of trying to destroy Russia.\n\nBut elsewhere military leaders were accused of incompetence.\n\nUkraine says as many as 400 people were killed or wounded at Makiivka, and numbers into the hundreds have been given by Russian nationalists on social media.\n\nHowever, there is no way of verifying how many soldiers were killed when US-made Himars missiles hit a vocational college packed with conscripts. Ammunition was also being stored close to the site, which was reduced to rubble.\n\nWhatever the number, this is the highest number of deaths acknowledged by Russia since it invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022.\n\nRallies were held in several cities in Russia's south-western region of Samara, where governor Dmitry Azarov said many of the conscripts had lived.\n\nThe biggest commemoration took place in the city of Samara itself, with at least 200 people taking part. Other official events were held in the industrial city of Tolyatti and in Syzran and Novokuybyshevsk.\n\nNo criticism was reported at the Samara rally, where the main remarks came from Yekaterina Kolotovkina, who said \"neither we nor our husbands wanted war; the entire West united against us to eliminate us and our children\".\n\nHers was very much an official voice as her husband, Lt Gen Andrei Kolotovkin, commands the 2nd Guards Combined Arms Army based in Samara.\n\nThe commander's wife's remarks prompted anger on social media with independent journalist Dmitry Kolezev pointing out that her husband did not die in Makiivka.\n\n\"Could we have at least some evidence?\" he asked, in response to her claim that the West intended to kill Samara's children. Another blogger condemned her comments as a \"pack of lies\".\n\nThe governor of Samara met defence ministry officials in Moscow on Tuesday and was expected to visit some of the wounded in hospital in the city of Rostov-on-Don the next day.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has so far said nothing about the attack, but did sign a decree on Tuesday for families of National Guard soldiers killed in service to be paid 5m roubles (57,000; $69,000).\n\nReuters\n\nThe building housing the conscripts was all but flattened in the Ukrainian attack\n\nThe soldiers sent to Makiivka were among an estimated 300,000 men signed up by Russia's military as part of the president's \"partial mobilisation\" announced last September in the face of a string of setbacks in Ukraine.\n\nA number of voices have been highly critical of the military in the aftermath of the attack on Makiivka, a city adjacent to the main city of Donetsk and some distance from the front line.\n\nPavel Gubarev, a former leading official in Russia's proxy authority in Donetsk, condemned the decision to place a large number of soldiers in one building as \"criminal negligence\".\n\nSuch mistakes were being made early in the war, he complained, and even if the conscripts did not realise the risk, the authorities should have.\n\n\"If no-one is punished for this, then it'll only get worse,\" he warned.\n\nOne theory promoted by local security officials was that Ukrainian forces had been able to detect the use of Russian mobile phones by servicemen arriving at the vocational college on New Year's Eve.\n\nThe deputy speaker of Moscow's local parliament, Andrei Medvedev, said it was predictable that the soldiers would be blamed - instead of the commander who made the original decision to position so many soldiers in one place.\n\n\"History will certainly preserve the names of those who tried to keep silent about the trouble, and those who tried to blame the dead soldier for everything,\" he wrote on Telegram.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's armed forces said they killed or wounded 500 Russian troops in another attack on New Year's Eve, on a village in the occupied southern region of Kherson.\n\nThere was no independent verification of the attack at Chulakivka, some 20km south of the River Dnipro.\n\nRussian forces retreated across the Dnipro in November and Ukrainian officials have posted video of a flag being hoisted on an island between the eastern and western banks of the river.\n\nUkraine's southern military command has warned that it is too early to talk of Velykyi Potomkin island being completely liberated.",

The deaths included that of a 15-year-old girl, according to officials.\n\nSome 64 others were also wounded.\n\n\"Tragedy!\" said Borys Filatov, mayor of the rocket-making city on the Dnieper River.\n\n\"Ive gone to the site. We will be going through the rubble all night.\"\n\nPictures from the scene showed firefighters putting out a blaze around the carcasses of some cars in Dnipro. A broad chunk of the apartment block was missing, while the exterior of the rest of the building was badly damaged.\n\nTrapped residents were signalling their location under the debris with their mobile phone torches, according to Ukrainian media reports.\n\n\"They keep sending SMS-es,\" Mikhailo Lysenko, deputy mayor of Dnipro said in a social media video. \"We stop our work now and then to keep silence and we hear people scream from underneath the rubble.\"\n\nRegional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said seven children were among the wounded, the youngest three years old.\n\n\"The fate of 26 people is still unknown,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was not yet known how many were under the rubble.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the death toll is growing every hour,\" he said in his nightly address.\n\nThe strikes Russias largest wave of attacks on Ukraine in two weeks came as the country was observing the traditional New Year.\n\nBesides Dnipro, other cities hit on Saturday included Odesa in the south, Kharkiv in the east, Lviv in the west and the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Civilian infrastructure, including electricity sites, were once again damaged and power outages were reported.\n\nEmergency blackouts were applied in \"most regions\" of Ukraine on Saturday due to the raids, Energy Minister German Galushchenko said.\n\nHe warned that the coming days would be \"difficult\".\n\nOfficials said the Kharkiv region lost power completely and that disruptions to electricity and water supplies in Lviv were also possible.\n\nRussia has been targeting Ukraines energy infrastructure with missiles and drones since October, causing sweeping blackouts and disruptions to central heating and running water.\n\nMilitary top commander Valerii Zaluzhny said that Russia fired 33 cruise missiles overall on Saturday, of which 21 were shot down.\n\nUK pledges tanks\n\nMoldova, Ukraines southwestern neighbour, said it had found missile debris on its territory after the latest Russian raids.\n\n\"Russias brutal war against Ukraine directly impacts Moldova again,\" President Maia Sandu tweeted, posting photos of the wreckage.\n\n\"We strongly condemn todays intensified attacks.\"\n\nIn his nightly speech, Zelenskyy appealed to the West to supply more weapons to prevent further deaths from what he described as \"Russian terror\".\n\n\"Whats needed for this? The kind of weapons that our partners have in stockpiles and that our warriors have come to expect. The whole world knows what and how to stop those who are sowing death,\" he said.\n\nSaturdays attack comes as Western powers consider sending heavy weaponry to Kyiv and ahead of a meeting of Ukraines allies in Ramstein in Germany next Friday, where governments will announce their latest pledges of military support.\n\nThe United Kingdom on Saturday became the first Western country to pledge heavy tanks for the war effort, with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak saying his country will send 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine.\n\nSunaks office said the British prime minister believed that a \"long and static war only serves Russias interests\".\n\n\"UK defence and security officials believe a window has opened up where Russia is on the backfoot due to resupply issues and plummeting morale,\" the statement said. \"The Prime Minister is therefore encouraging allies to deploy their planned support for 2023 as soon as possible to have maximum impact.\"\n\nSaturdays attacks came as Ukrainian and Russian forces battled for control of Soledar, a small salt-mining town in eastern Ukraine that for days has been the focus of a relentless Russian assault.\n\nCapturing Soledar, which had a pre-war population of 10,000, could improve the position of Russian forces as they push towards what has been their main target since October, the nearby transport crossroads of Bakhmut.\n\nRussia said on Friday that its forces had taken control of the town, but Ukraine has denied the claim.\n\nAl Jazeeras Charles Stratford, reporting from near Soledar, said there was no obvious sign of a Ukrainian withdrawal from the town.\n\n\"Russia says its taken full control of Soledar, but the smoke rising from impact sites, the explosions from almost constant artillery and heavy machine gun fire suggests otherwise,\" he said.\n\nOn streets leading to Soledar, army medics were waiting at intervals to take the wounded to hospitals away from the front line, said Stratford. Ukrainian armoured personnel carriers were seen carrying troops towards the town, while the tree lines were packed with artillery in defensive positions.\n\nOne soldier appealed for better weapons.\n\n\"It will be hard for us to push them back,\" he told Al Jazeera. \"We will suffer big losses. They move in such great numbers that sometimes our old guns overheat as we try to shoot as many as we can.\"\n\nTurkey said Saturday it was ready to push for local ceasefires in Ukraine and warned that neither Moscow nor Kyiv had the military means to \"win the war\".\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogans foreign policy adviser, Ibrahim Kalin, conceded that it seemed unlikely that the warring sides were ready to strike an \"overarching peace deal\" in the coming months.",

                "cc_text": "Russia has stepped up its attacks around Bakhmut in Ukraine's eastern region of Donbas and particularly around the city of Soledar, few miles north of Bakhmut. According to Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar, Russian troops have commenced another major assault.\n\nUkrainian forces repelled an earlier attempt to take the town, but a large number of Wagner units quickly returned, deploying fresh tactics and more soldiers under heavy artillery cover, Maliar said on Telegram.\n\n\"The enemy literally step over the corpses of their own soldiers, using massed artillery, MLRS systems and mortars,\" she added, explaining that the attackers were drawn from Wagner's best reserves.\n\nSo far, Russian forces have been unsuccessful in capturing the city of Soledar despite their \"desperate attempt to storm the city from different directions\" and despite throwing \"the most professional units of the Wagnerites into battle,\" said Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian ground forces, referring to the Kremlin-linked Wagner mercenary group.\n\nUkrainian officials say they are strengthening forces around Bakhmut and repelling constant attacks by Wagner fighters, whose leader, businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, is targeting the area's vast underground mines.\n\nIn his nightly video address Monday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the resilience of Ukraine's forces fighting off waves of attacks in Donbas had helped the country win time and gain strength.\n\n\"Thanks to the resilience of our soldiers in Soledar, we have won for Ukraine additional time and additional strength,\" he said.\n\nA U.S. official has said Prigozhin, a powerful ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is eyeing the salt and gypsum reserves from the mines in the area but Prigozhin has also said that he wants to seize the vast underground tunnels in the area that can fit large numbers of tanks and other armaments.\n\nSerhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine's Eastern Military Command, reported that the city of Soledar, which has long been a target of Russia's Bakhmut offensive, is \"practically destroyed.\"\n\nIn an evacuee center in nearby Kramatorsk, Olha, 60, who declined to give her last name, said she had fled Soledar after moving from apartment to apartment as each was destroyed in tank battles.\n\n\"There isn't one house left intact,\" she said. \"Apartments were burning, breaking in half,\" she said.\n\nPro-Russian bloggers quoted Prigozhin as saying his forces were fighting for the administration building in Soledar.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said reinforcements had been sent to Soledar and everything was being done to fend off the enemy.\n\n\"There are brutal and bloody battles there106 shellings in one day,\" Cherevatyi said on Ukrainian television.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential staff, said Moscow was suffering huge losses to try to justify its mobilization of reservists but was not succeeding. \"Our soldiers' feat is titanic,\" he wrote on Telegram.\n\nReuters was not able to independently verify the battlefield reports.\n\nIncreased military support\n\nThe United States announced Thursday, it will send Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles to Ukraine to bolster Kyiv's fight against Russia's invasion. The delivery, expected to total about 50 units, comes alongside a commitment from Germany to send its own armored vehicles and a similar move by France last week. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Monday he was certain of the need to coordinate weapons deliveries to Ukraine with allies as pressure mounts on Berlin to send Kyiv its Leopard 2 battle tanks.\n\n\"Germany will not go alone,\" he said at an event of his center-left Social Democrat party (SPD) kicking off the campaign for the Berlin state election.\n\n\"Germany will always remain united with its friends and allies ... Anything else would be irresponsible in such a dangerous situation.\"\n\nGermany has become one of Ukraine's top military supporters in response to Russia's invasion on Ukraine last February.\n\nSky News reported Britain was also considering supplying Ukraine with battle tanks.\n\nAccording to VOA's National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin, at a Pentagon briefing Monday, a U.S. official said training for Ukrainian troops at the battalion level will start this month, if it hasn't started already.\n\nHe also praised Ukrainian air defenses. \"Look at the success that they're having not just against cruise missiles but against the UAVs [drones] it's really staggeringly positive,\" the official said, adding that the West expects Ukrainian air defenses will only get stronger with the additional help coming from the U.S. and others.\n\nAccording to VOA's Carla Babb, a Pentagon official called the fight in Bakhmut \"really savage.\"\n\n\"And what I mean by savage is you're talking about thousands upon thousands of artillery rounds that have been delivered between both sides,\" he said, adding that Russian mercenary forces sacrifice their weaker soldiers by putting them in the front lines.\n\nThey \"essentially take the brunt,\" he said, adding that better trained forces then \"move behind them to claim the ground.\"\n\nThe Kremlin said new Western deliveries of armored vehicles to Ukraine would exacerbate the conflict, and, as Kremlin spokesperson man Dmitry Peskov told reporters at a briefing Monday, \"would deepen the suffering of the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nIn the north, Ukrainian officials said Monday a Russian missile hit a market in the Kharkiv region, killing a 10-year-old girl and wounding several others.\n\nThe officials said the missile struck the village of Shevchenkove, about 75 kilometers from the city of Kharkiv.\n\n\"We brutally condemn this act of terror,\" Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova tweeted along with a video and photos of a large crater and a building in flames. \"The only proper response is more weapons for Ukraine.\"\n\nSome material in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nRecent Russian gains in Soledar do not portend an imminent encirclement of Bakhmut, contrary to claims made by Russian sources. Even at the most generous interpretation of Russian milblogger narratives, which claim that Russian forces are fighting on the outskirts of Razdolivka (about 6km northwest of Soledar), Russian forces are still far from being within striking distance of an operational encirclement of Bakhmut.[1] In order to effectively cut Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) into Bakhmut, Russian forces would have to establish control of the T0513 Siversk-Bakhmut highway (currently 7km west of the furthest point of confirmed Russian advances in the Soledar area) and reach the E40 Slovyansk-Bakhmut highway (13km from the furthest point of confirmed Russian advance in the Soledar area) at least. Considering that the recent rate of gains in this area has been on the order of a few hundred meters a day, at most, it is highly unlikely that Russian forces will be successful in cohering a mechanized push towards these GLOCs and move towards encircling Bakhmut.[2] Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut would still have GLOCs available even if the Russians cut the E40, moreover, making the entire discussion of an encirclement at this point bizarre.\n\nRussia continues to weaponize religion to perpetuate long-standing information operations and discredit Ukraine. Russian milbloggers responded to footage posted on January 7 of uniformed Ukrainian servicemen attending Orthodox Christmas services at the Kyiv-Perchesk Lavra and decried it as a reprisal and open war on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Moscow Patriarchate (UOC MP).[3] Several milbloggers referred to the footage as evidence that the Lavra has been \"captured\" by \"heretics and schismatics.\"[4] The milblogger vitriol at the footage of Christmas services at the Lavra follows the decision by the Ukrainian government to take back control of the main cathedral of the Kyiv-Perchesk Lavra from the UOC MP and allow the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) to hold Orthodox Christmas services at the Lavra on January 7.[5] The Russian response to the Ukrainian governments decision to transfer control of the Lavra to the OCU exemplifies Moscows continued weaponization of religion in order to frame Ukraine as evil and position Russia as the protector of Orthodox Christian values, as ISW has previously reported.[6]\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not disrupted the ability of observers to celebrate Orthodox Christmas in Ukraine. Russian milbloggers falsely presented the legal transfer of the Kyiv-Perchesk Lavra from the UOC MP, which the Ukrainian government maintains has explicit links to the Kremlin and has provided material and spiritual support to the Russian war in Ukraine, to the OCU as an attack on the ability of observers of Orthodox tradition to celebrate Christmas. Orthodox services continued through Ukraine, including in the Kyiv-Perchesk Lavra, throughout the course of the day on January 7.[7] The Ukrainian government position that elements of the UOC MP, from which Kyiv removed control of the Lavra, is supported by Russian President Vladimir Putins continued association with the Russian Orthodox Church. In his speech on Orthodox Christmas, Putin thanked the ROC for its continued support for Russian troops in Ukraine.[8] Ukraine is not suppressing the religious liberties of Orthodox Christians, contrary to the Russian information operation, and is instead taking the steps it deems necessary to distance Ukrainian cultural heritage from religious elements it asserts are linked to the Kremlin and its conduct of the war.\n\nRussian forces reportedly continue to deplete their missile arsenal but will likely continue to be able to threaten Ukrainian critical infrastructure and civilians at scale in the near term. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov published an infographic on January 6 detailing that Russian forces have expended roughly 81 percent of their strategic missile stocks and 19 percent of their tactical missile stocks.[9] Reznikov reported that Russian forces reportedly have remaining of their pre-war and post-invasion production stocks:\n\n92 Iskander 9M723 missiles (11 percent),\n\n52 Iskander 9M728/9M729 missiles (44 percent),\n\n118 Kh-101 and Kh-555/55SM missiles (16 percent),\n\n162 Kh-22/32 missiles (44 percent),\n\n53 Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missiles (84 percent), and\n\n59 sea-based Kalibr missiles (9 percent).[10]\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) stated that it would never run out of sea-based Kalibr missiles while conducting a massive series of missile strikes on December 29, 2022.[11] Russian forces last used sea-based Kalibr missiles in Ukraine during their ninth large-scale series of missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure on December 16.[12] Although the Russian militarys tactical missile stock is less expended, S-300 and 3M-55 Onyx missiles are less precise systems than Russian strategic missiles, which is likely why Russian forces have not used these systems extensively in large-scale missile strikes against Ukrainian critical infrastructure.\n\nReznikov reported that Russia has managed to produce since the February 2022 invasion:\n\n290 Kh-101 and Kh-555/55SM missiles (65 percent of the pre-war stock),\n\n150 Kalibr missiles (30 percent of the pre-war stock),\n\n36 Iskander 9M723 missiles (5 percent of the pre-war stock),\n\n20 Iskander 9M728/9M729 missiles (20 percent of the pre-war stock),\n\nand 20 Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missiles (47 percent of the pre-war stock).[13]\n\nThe Russian production of strategic missiles since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in comparison to the Russian military's pre-war stock highlights that Russia has not mobilized its military industry to support Russian military operations in Ukraine. A country would normally increase the production of missile, rocket, and other weapons systems and munitions before embarking on a major war and would normally put its military industry on a war footing once the war began. Russia has done neither. Putins failure to mobilize Russian industry to support the Russian war effort in Ukraine may result from fears that further economic disruptions could produce further domestic discontent in Russia because Western sanctions regimes have placed significant constraints on Russian military industry, or because of inherent limitations of Russian industry and military industryor some combination of these factors. The current level of the Russian militarys depletion of strategic missile systems may constrain how often and at what scale Russian forces conduct future massive series of missile strikes in Ukraine, but Russian forces will be able to continue their campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure at scale in the near term and threaten the lives of Ukrainian civilians.\n\nRussian forces have also reportedly depleted their arsenal of Iranian-made drones following an increased pace of drone attacks in Ukraine in the past month. Russian forces have reportedly expended 88 percent of their stock of the Shahed-131 and 136 drones that they have so far received from Iran, with only 90 Iranian-made drones remaining according to Reznikov.[14] ISW previously assessed that Russian forces increased their use of Shahed drones in attacks on Ukraine over the past month in order to maintain the pace of their campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure without further depleting their more valuable missile stocks.[15] Russias contract with Iran reportedly stipulates that Iran will send an additional 1,000 Shahed drones to Russia.[16] Russian forces will likely be able to conduct only a handful of massive drone attacks in Ukraine in the near term until Russia receives from Iran another delivery of drones, which reportedly come in batches of 200 to 300.[17]\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nRecent Russian gains in Soledar do not portend an imminent Russian encirclement of Bakhmut.\n\nRussia continues to weaponize religion to perpetuate long-standing information operations and discredit Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces reportedly continue to deplete their missile arsenal and stock of Iranian-made drones but will likely continue to threaten Ukrainian infrastructure at scale in the near term.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations near Svatove and Kreminna.\n\nRussian forces made marginal confirmed advances in Soledar amid continuing Russian offensive operations around Bakhmut and along the western outskirts of Donetsk City.\n\nRussian forces continue efforts to establish further control over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).\n\nUkrainian and European officials continue to warn that Russia is preparing for an imminent second wave of mobilization.\n\nRussian occupation authorities continue to transport Ukrainian children to Russian territory under the guise of medical rehabilitation schemes.\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian CounteroffensivesEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and one supporting effort);\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortCapture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting EffortSouthern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast)\n\nRussian and Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations near Svatove on January 7. The Ukrainian General Staff stated that Russian troops northwest of Svatove in the Kupyansk direction are trying to improve their tactical positions and that Ukrainian troops repelled an attack near Stelmakhivka (15km northwest of Svatove).[18] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Ukrainian troops attempted to counterattack towards Synkivka (45km northwest of Svatove).[19] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian troops attempted to advance on Stelmakhkivka and Novoselivske (13km northwest of Svatove).[20] The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported that a Russian engineering and sapper unit arrived in Svatove to examine options for potentially blowing the dam of a nearby reservoir in order to slow Ukrainian advances in the Svatove area.[21] Footage posted by Russian media outlet RIA Novosti shows a BMPT armored fighting vehicle in the Svatove area manned by personnel who appear to be wearing patches of the 3rd Army Corps.[22]\n\nRussian and Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations near Kreminna on January 7. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian troops attempted to attack near Makiivka (22km northwest of Kreminna), Dibrova (5km southwest of Kreminna), and Bilohorivka (10km south of Kreminna).[23] A Russian milblogger noted that Russian forces are attacking towards Makiivka and that Makiivka and the surrounding area are a \"grey zone.\"[24] The Russian MoD reported Ukrainian assault groups are operating in the Serebrianka forest area southwest of Kreminna.[25]\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nRussian forces made marginal confirmed advances in Soledar, but Ukrainian forces maintain control of the settlement as of January 7. Geolocated footage shows a Wagner Group fighter at the Artyomsol Plant in central Soledar.[26] Russian milbloggers also broadly claimed that Wagner Group forces are fighting around Soledar on the streets in Pidhorodne, Krasna Hora, Krasnopillia, Blahodatne, Razdolivka, and Vesele and that Wagner Group fighters have taken complete control of Pidhorodne.[27] ISW has not observed visual confirmation to corroborate these extensive claims, beyond footage of the aftermath of urban combat and fighting in residential buildings in Soledar over the course of January 6 and 7.[28] A Ukrainian military correspondent posted a geolocated picture of himself in front of the Soledar Salt Mine in northwestern Soledar, indicating that Ukrainian troops hold the northwestern part of the settlement and repelled reported Russian attacks on this part of the mine.[29] Spokesperson for the Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces, Serhiy Cherevaty, denied Russian claims that Ukrainian troops are withdrawing from Soledar, and the Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops continue to repel Russian attacks on the settlement.[30]\n\nRussian forces additionally continued ground attacks south of Bakhmut on January 7. Geolocated footage confirms that Wagner Group forces advanced into Klishchiivka (6km southwest of Bakhmut).[31] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks south of Bakhmut near Ozerianivka and Klishchiivka.[32] Russian milbloggers additionally discussed fighting south of Bakhmut near Opytne.[33] Graphic drone footage posted on January 7 shows the corpses of Wagner Group forces scattered near Bakhmut, indicating that combat in this area continues to be highly attritional.[34]\n\nRussian forces continued ground attacks along the western outskirts of Donetsk City on January 7. The Ukrainian General Staff stated that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks near Pervomaiske on the northwestern outskirts of Donetsk City, and near Marinka and Pobieda on the southwestern outskirts.[35] A Russian milblogger reported that Russian troops are attempting to bypass Avdiivka (north of Donetsk City) from positions to the north, and that the next decisive offensive action in this sector will be on Pervomaiske.[36] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Ukrainian troops conducted unsuccessful assaults northwest of Donetsk City towards Krasnohorivka and Heorhiivka.[37] Social media footage shows Russian offensive operations within Marinka, where a milblogger claimed that Russian troops are trying to bypass Ukrainian fortifications from the south.[38] Russian forces did not conduct any confirmed or claimed ground attacks in western Donetsk Oblast and continued routine fire along the line of contact in western Donetsk and eastern Zaporizhia oblasts.[39]\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nRussian forces continued routine indirect fire west of Hulyaipole and along the west (right) bank of the Dnipro River in Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson oblasts on January 7 despite the declared Russian ceasefire.[40] Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces struck Kherson City and Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.[41] Ukrainian Mayor of Kamianske, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Andriy Bilousov, reported that Ukrainian air defense shot down a Russian drone near the settlement.[42] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) likely tried to preempt criticism that Russian indirect fire continued during the period of the Russian ceasefire by claiming that Russian forces returned fire in Zaporizhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kherson oblasts to suppress Ukrainian artillery strikes against Russian positions in southern Ukraine.[43]\n\nRussian forces continue efforts to establish further control over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) as of January 7. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian occupation troops have forced about 3,000 employees at the ZNPP to obtain Russian passports.[44] Russian authorities likely forced many Ukrainian employees at the ZNPP to obtain Russian passports in order to support ongoing efforts to force the employees to sign employment contracts with Russian state nuclear power company Rosatom.[45] Energoatom reported that only 100 out of the 6700 remaining Ukrainian workers at the plant have signed contracts with Rosatom as of October 28, 2022.[46]\n\nRussian sources claimed that Russian air defenses shot down a Ukrainian drone in the vicinity of Russian-occupied Sevastopol, Crimea on the night of January 6 to 7.[47]\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nUkrainian and European officials continue to warn that Russia is preparing for an imminent second wave of mobilization. Head of the Estonian Defense Forces intelligence center Colonel Margo Grosberg stated that Russian authorities are preparing for an imminent second wave of mobilization while continuing covert mobilization and noted that details regarding this new wave will likely become clear following Orthodox Christmas.[48] Grosberg noted that a printer in Krasnodar Krai has already received an order for 5,000 mobilization call-up slips.[49] Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) representative Andriy Chernak reported on January 7 that Russian officials plan to mobilize up to 500,000 Russians, including residents of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, which arguably have faced lighter mobilization pushes in the past.[50] Ukrainian and Russian sources continue to detail ongoing Russian mobilization efforts in Russia and occupied parts of Ukraine and refusals of Russian officials to release soldiers with expired contracts.[51] One Russian source accused \"provocateurs\" of spreading false reports of mobilization to push a false narrative of the existence of a second wave.[52] However, as Ukrainian and other officials have noted, and as ISW has previously reported, discussion of a \"second\" wave of mobilization is somewhat misleading because mobilization efforts never truly ceased after the purported \"end\" of partial mobilization.[53] Even the initial partial mobilization efforts in Russia were not truly the first mobilization wave; moreover, they were the first mobilization efforts aimed at the reserve on the tail end of regionally-based volunteer recruitment drives throughout the summer of 2022. The volunteer recruitment drives, finally, followed the call-up of Russian reservists in advance of the invasion of February 24, 2022. Each successive reserve call-up reaches deeper into the pool of men who have been out of service longer, are older, in worse health, or were exempted in previous waves.\n\nRussian authorities continue to recruit for territorial defense forces and perpetuate the unrealistic threat of a Ukrainian ground assault on Russian border regions. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 7 that Russian police in Belgorod Oblast are implementing a recruitment campaign following the failure of the initial plan to generate volunteers.[54] Russian servicemen reportedly visit residential areas, survey the male population of military age, and engage in discussions aimed at popularizing service.[55]\n\nA Russian news outlet reported on January 6 that Russian authorities want to conduct \"revenue mobilization\" and collect a one-time payment of an unspecified amount from large businesses in order to fund the war and address problems in the state budget.[56] The source also claimed that Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin provided Russian officials in mid-December with relevant instructions for \"revenue mobilization\" and a proposal to allocate 175 billion rubles (about $2.4 million) to fund the war and additionally to provide for the resettlement of residents of Kherson Oblast to unspecified locations.[57] Russia continues to seek methods to circumvent growing financial difficulties, as ISW has previously reported.[58]\n\nRussian military leadership continues to experience challenges with maintaining the morale of mobilized servicemen. A Russian mobilization Telegram channel posted video footage on January 7 in which previously mobilized servicemen of Belgorod Oblast asked to go home after stating that Russian leadership sent them to the territory of the Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) as cannon fodder.[59] A Russian source claimed on January 8 that mobilized servicemen of the 568th Howitzer Artillery Battalion, now subordinate to the DNRs 1st Army corps, complained that their command is transferring them into an infantry role for which they were not trained.[60] Independent Georgia-based investigative organization Conflict Intelligence Team reported on January 6 that several mobilized Russian servicemen training in Belarus escaped from their unit and stated that the servicemen are on a wanted list in Minsk Oblast.[61]\n\nRussian military leadership continues to face resistance in ethnic enclaves following past partial mobilization efforts. The \"Free Yakutia Foundation,\" established on August 24, operates similarly to the other ethnic advocacy groups in Russia with anti-war and anti-xenophobia sentiments and seeks independence from Russia.[62] The \"Free Yakutia Foundation\" states that Russias partial mobilization scheme is part of a larger effort to ethnically cleanse indigenous peoples from Russia and that Russian military leadership intentionally sends minority groups of Russia into Ukraine as cannon fodder.[63] A Russian source claimed on January 7 that the \"Free Yakutia Foundations\" emphasis on the Russian government as a totalitarian and oppressive institution is overstated and unpopular in Russias Yakutia (Sakha) Republic and that the West is fixated on dividing the Russian Federation along ethnic lines.[64] ISW has previously reported that ethnic minority enclaves largely face the brunt of force generation efforts, which may prove to be a source of domestic dissent for the Kremlin as the war continues.[65]\n\nSome Russians continue to challenge Russian force-generation efforts. A Russian news outlet reported on January 6 that Russian authorities in Rostov-on-Don, Rostov Oblast detained three people, including two minors, on suspicion of intent to set fire to a military recruiting office using Molotov cocktails.[66]\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nRussian occupation authorities are continuing to transport Ukrainian children to Russian territory under the guise of medical rehabilitation schemes. Luhansk Oblast Administration Head Serhiy Haidai stated on January 7 that Russian occupation authorities transported 300 Ukrainian children to Moscow Oblast hospitals after Russian field doctors in Luhansk Oblast conducted medical exams to identify children with \"serious injuries.\"[67] Haidai also reported on January 7 that teachers in occupied Luhansk Oblast accept bribes from Russian occupation officials to provide authorities with lists of children for medical examinations.[68]\n\nRussian forces and occupation authorities are continuing to take measures to control movement in occupied territories. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on January 7 that Russian forces are collecting data on local residents after Russian occupation authorities introduced special permits allowing civilian movement between settlements in occupied Zaporizhia Oblast.[69] The Ukrainian Resistance Center also reported on January 7 that residents must specify the purpose of their movement and identify the person they are visiting, allowing Russian forces to gather data on connections between residents in occupied Zaporizhia Oblast.[70]\n\nRussian forces and occupation authorities are continuing to use intimidation to consolidate economic and administrative control of occupied territories. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 7 that Russian occupation authorities fully eradicated the Ukrainian hryvnia from circulation in occupied Enerhodar, Zaporizhia Oblast, by threatening local entrepreneurs with fines and confiscation of property.[71] The Ukrainian General Staff stated on January 7 that Russian forces have increased seizures of residential property in Enerhodar as the number of houses abandoned due to forced evacuation has increased.\n\nRussian occupation authorities are continuing to intensify measures to consolidate social control of occupied territories. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 7 that Russian occupation authorities replaced all Ukrainian television channels with Russian programming in Melitopol and Pryazovske, Zaporizhia Oblast.[72]\n\nRussian occupation authorities continued intensifying efforts to identify partisan activity in occupied territories on January 7. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on January 7 that Russian occupation authorities created a Telegram chatbot to encourage local residents to report on and identify Ukrainian partisans operating in Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast.[73]\n\nISW will continue to report daily observed indicators consistent with the current assessed most dangerous course of action (MDCOA): a renewed invasion of northern Ukraine possibly aimed at Kyiv.\n\nISWs December 15 MDCOA warning forecast about a potential Russian offensive against northern Ukraine in winter 2023 remains a worst-case scenario within the forecast cone. ISW currently assesses the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine from Belarus as low, but possible, and the risk of Belarusian direct involvement as very low. This new section in the daily update is not in itself a forecast or assessment. It lays out the daily observed indicators we are using to refine our assessments and forecasts, which we expect to update regularly. Our assessment that the MDCOA remains unlikely has not changed. We will update this header if the assessment changes.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this report incorrectly identified Lieutenant-General Oleksandr Pavliuk by his previous position as the Kyiv Oblast Military Administration Head. He is currently the Commander of the Kyiv Defense Forces.\n\nObserved indicators for the MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nNothing significant to report.\n\nObserved ambiguous indicators for MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nNothing significant to report.\n\nObserved counter-indicators for the MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nCommander of the Kyiv Defense Forces Lieutenant-General Oleksandr Pavliuk stated on January 7 that there is currently no immediate threat of a Russian offensive on Kyiv from Belarusian territory.[74] Pavliuk claimed that Russian forces are deployed near the Ukrainian-Belarusian border to pin Ukrainian forces on the northern border so that Ukrainian command cannot transfer these forces to eastern Ukraine.[75] Pavliuk stated that Ukrainian forces are considering the possibility of a Russian offensive in northwestern Ukraine in the coming months but have not observed Russian forces transfer the appropriate number of forces and means to Belarus in preparation for such an offensive.[76]\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff reiterated that it has not observed Russian forces in Belarus forming a strike group as of January 7.[77]\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

They were saying ''this isn't war, this is hell''.\n\n'Missiles were landing on the building next door, the roof was shaking.

                "cc_text": "(CNN) Air raid sirens rang out across Ukraine on Saturday as Russia carried out another series of missile attacks across the country, including one in Dnipro that hit a nine-story apartment building and killed at least 12 people.\n\nMissiles and explosions were heard everywhere from Lviv in the west; Kharkiv in the northeast; Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro in the southeast; Myokaliv in the south; and Kharkiv in the northeast, officials said.\n\nIn Dnipro, another 27 people, including six children, were hospitalized after being wounded in the apartment building strike, according to Valentyn Reznichenko, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration.\n\nLocal authorities are working to dig people from the rubble but 26 remain trapped, according to Reznichenko. So far, at least 15 have been rescued, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"We are fighting for every person, every life,\" Zelensky said on social media.\n\nIn his nightly address on Saturday, Zelensky said \"dozens\" of people, including a three-year-old girl, were rescued from the building even though most of the floors were \"smashed\" in the strike.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said the Russian missile fired at the apartment block in Dnipro was a Kh-22 the same type that hit a busy shopping mall in central Ukraine last summer.\n\nYurii Ihnat, spokesman for the Ukrainian air force, said the Kh-22 \"was fired from a Tu-22M3 long-range bomber, launched from the area near Kursk and the Sea of Azov.\"\n\n\"There were a total of five launches of these missiles,\" Ihnat said.\n\nThe Kh-22 is an older type of cruise missile that is less accurate than most modern missiles.\n\nAttack on the capital\n\nAuthorities in Kyiv said there was an \"attack on the capital.\" Blasts were heard as early as 6 a.m. local time, according to the head of Kyiv region military administration, Oleksiy Kuleba. Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said strikes hit the citys east bank, where several power facilities were located. The exact locations of the blasts could not be immediately verified by CNN. A thick fog blanketed much of the city.\n\nHowever, Oleksandr Pavliuk, a Kyiv-based commander in the Ukrainian army, said the explosions in Kyiv were not caused by Russian attacks.\n\n\"The explosions are not connected with the threat from the air or air defense, as well as with any military actions,\" Pavliuk wrote on the encrypted social media app Telegram. \"If there was a threat you would have heard the alarm. The cause of the explosions will be reported separately.\"\n\nRussias latest nationwide salvo appeared to target critical infrastructure across Ukraine, as the Kremlin continues its efforts to limit the countrys ability to heat and power itself in the middle of winter.\n\nFierce fighting in Soledar\n\nOn the battlefield, all eyes are fixed on Soledar, a town of little strategic value that Russia is attempting to retake in the hopes that it will provide Russian President Vladimir Putin a symbolic victory. Various units of the Ukrainian military said that Soledar remains the scene of \"fierce fighting.\" Russias Ministry of Defense claimed that its forces took control of the town, although Kyiv has denied it.\n\nAfter a broad assessment regarding the situation on the ground in Ukraine, several Western governments have decided to answer Zelenskys longstanding call to supply modern battle tanks to Kyiv.\n\nFrance, Poland and the United Kingdom have pledged to soon send tanks for the Ukrainian military to use in its efforts to protect itself from Russia. Finland is considering following suit. Britain said it plans to send a dozen Challenger 2 tanks and additional artillery systems. Poland plans to send a company of German-built Leopard tanks while France will deliver its domestically built AMX 10-RCs.\n\nWe want to hear from you. Have a story idea or tip?

REUTERS/Yevhen Titov Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nSummary Five people killed in nine-storey block -Kyiv officials\n\nAt least 60 injured as part of building reduced to rubble\n\nRussian missiles again hit energy facilities across country\n\nZelenskiy calls for more weapons to fight Russia\n\nKYIV, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Russia unleashed a major missile attack on Ukraine on Saturday, smashing a nine-storey apartment block in the city of Dnipro, killing at least five people and striking vital energy facilities, officials said.\n\nUkraine's energy minister said the coming days would be \"difficult\" as months of Russian bombardment of the power grid threaten the supply of electricity, running water and central heating at the height of winter.\n\nIn the east-central city of Dnipro, 20 people were rescued from an apartment block where an entire section of the building had been reduced to rubble, sending smoke billowing into the sky, the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office said.\n\n\"Tragedy. I've gone to the site.... We will be going through the rubble all night,\" said Borys Filatov, mayor of the rocket-making city on the Dnipro River.\n\nFive people were killed and at least 60 people, including 12 children, were also wounded in the attack, with more people were still trapped under the rubble, the regional governor said.\n\nAnother person was killed and one wounded in the steel-making city of Kryviy Rih where six houses were damaged in President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's hometown, mayor Oleksandr Vilkul said.\n\nIn his nightly speech, Zelenskiy appealed to the West to supply more weapons to prevent further deaths from what he described as \"Russian terror\".\n\n\"What's needed for this? The kind of weapons that our partners have in stockpiles and that our warriors have come to expect. The whole world knows what and how to stop those who are sowing death,\" he said.\n\nSaturday's attack comes as Western powers consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv and ahead of a meeting of Ukraine's allies in Ramstein in Germany next Friday where governments will announce their latest pledges of military support.\n\nOn the front lines in the east, Ukraine said its forces were battling to hold onto control of the small town of Soledar where Russia has sacrificed large numbers of troops and resources to try to secure some kind of advance after months of setbacks.\n\nIn Dnipro, pictures showed firefighters putting out a blaze around the carcasses of some cars. A broad chunk of the apartment block was missing. The exterior of the rest of the building was badly damaged. Wounded people were carried away on stretchers.\n\nRussia, which invaded Ukraine last February, has been pounding its energy infrastructure with missiles and drones since October, causing sweeping blackouts and disruptions to central heating and running water. Ukraine shot down 25 of 38 Russian missiles of different types, the Air Force said.\n\nMissiles struck critical infrastructure facilities in the eastern region of Kharkiv and the western region of Lviv, officials said. Kharkiv region lost power completely and disruptions to electricity and water supplies in Lviv were also possible, officials said.\n\nMoldova's interior ministry said missile debris had been found in the north of the country near the Ukraine border following the air strikes.\n\nMORNING ATTACK\n\nThe attack on Saturday came hours after a smaller-scale missile attack hit critical infrastructure in Kyiv and the eastern city of Kharkiv.\n\nThe first attack was unusual because missiles struck their targets before the air raid siren even sounded. No one was reported hurt then, but missile debris caused a fire in one area and houses were damaged outside the capital, officials said.\n\nDTEK, the biggest private electricity company, introduced emergency blackouts in several regions.\n\nResidential infrastructure was also hit in the village of Kopyliv outside the capital. The windows and roofs of 18 privately owned houses were shattered or damaged by the blast, Oleksiy Kuleba, the regional governor, said.\n\nCommenting on the first attack, Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said Russia's missiles had likely been fired along a high, looping ballistic trajectory from the north, which would explain why the air raid siren did not sound.\n\nUkraine is not able to identify and shoot down ballistic missiles, he told the Ukrainska Pravda online outlet.\n\nMISSILES STRIKE KHARKIV\n\nIn Ukraine's northeast, two S-300 missiles struck the city of Kharkiv near the Russian border early on Saturday, according to regional governor Oleg Synehubov.\n\nThe attacks hit critical energy and industrial targets in the Kharkiv and Chuhuev district of the region, he said.\n\nSaturday's strikes came as Ukrainian and Russian forces battled for control of Soledar, a small salt-mining town in eastern Ukraine that for days has been the focus of a relentless Russian assault.\n\nUkraine insisted that its forces were battling to hold onto control of Soledar, but acknowledged the situation was difficult, that street fighting was raging and that Russian forces were advancing from various directions.\n\nRussia said on Friday that its forces had taken control of the town with a pre-war population of 10,000, in what would be a minor advance, but one holding psychological importance for Russian forces who have suffered months of battlefield setbacks.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the situation in Soledar.\n\nWriting by Tom Balmforth Editing by Angus MacSwan, Mark Heinrich, Tomasz Janowski and Frances Kerry\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

He also reported rocket attacks on Kramatorsk and Konstantynivka.\n\nBakhmut was once a city of 70,000 people. It is now mostly abandoned, its reduced population kept alive by volunteers who help maintain invincibility centers, which are often tents set up to offer electricity, internet service, heat, water and medicine.\n\nOne person was killed in the Kharkiv region, in the town of Merefa, and two other settlements in the region were shelled, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said.\n\nThe attacks came as the Russian military claimed missiles launched at Kramatorsk had struck barracks used by Ukrainian troops, killing 600 people, but Ukrainian officials denied there were any casualties.\n\nRussia said the attacks on the barracks, two temporary bases in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, came in retaliation for the deaths of dozens of Russian soldiers in a rocket attack a week ago on a facility in Makiivka.\n\nBut Ukraine said only civilian infrastructure was hit in the Russian attack. \"The armed forces of Ukraine weren't affected,\" a military spokesman said.\n\nIn a new analysis, Britains Defense Ministry said Sunday in an intelligence update about Russias invasion of Ukraine that Russia seems undecided about where the greatest threat from Ukraine lies.\n\nIn the update, posted on Twitter, the ministry said, \"The way Russia has worked on improving defenses suggests commanders are highly likely pre-occupied with the potential for major Ukrainian offensive action in two sectors: either in northern Luhansk Oblast, or in Zaporizhzhia. A major Ukrainian breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia would seriously challenge the viability of Russia's land bridge' linking Russia's Rostov region and Crimea; Ukrainian success in Luhansk would further undermine Russia's professed war aim of liberating' the Donbas.\"\n\n\"Deciding which of these threats to prioritize countering,\" the report said, is \"likely one of the central dilemmas for Russian operational planners.\"\n\nBakhmuts underground\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russia's Wagner mercenary group, which is fighting alongside regular Russian army troops in the battle of Bakhmut, said on Telegram he wanted to capture the small town because it contained \"underground cities\" that can hold troops and tanks.\n\n\"The cherry on the cake is the system of Soledar and Bakhmut mines, which is actually a network of underground cities. It not only [has the ability to hold] a big group of people at a depth of 80-100 meters, but tanks and infantry fighting vehicles can also move about,\" Prigozhin said on Telegram.\n\nPrigozhin, who likely would see his political influence in Moscow boosted if Bakhmut fell to Russia given Wagner's role in the fighting there, said stockpiles of weapons had been stored in the underground complexes since World War I.\n\nHis comments were a reference to vast salt and other mines in the area, which contain more than 100 miles of tunnels and a vast underground room that has hosted football matches and classical music concerts in more peaceful times.\n\nPrigozhin, also called Bakhmut \"a serious logistics center\" with unique defensive fortifications.\n\nRussia's heavy losses over a five-month effort to advance in Bakhmut has led some Western military analysts to say that any Russian victory there, if it happens, would be pyrrhic.\n\nSome material in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

The US and Germany announced the same week that they would send Bradley fighting vehicles and Marder armoured personnel carriers, respectively, for the first time.\n\nThe UKs decision to provide the tanks came as Russian forces fired missiles at Ukraines capital and other cities around the country on Saturday, hitting critical infrastructure.\n\nAt least 12 people were killed and more than 64 wounded in the southeastern city of Dnipro, where a Russian missile attack destroyed a section of an apartment building, regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said.\n\nSeven children were among the wounded, the youngest three years old, he added, saying \"the fate of 26 people is still unknown\".\n\nInfrastructure facilities were also hit in the western Lviv region and northeastern Kharkiv.

Those weapons which are in the depots of our partners and which our soldiers are waiting for so much,\" he said in his nightly video address, adding that his forces shot down more than 20 out of 30 Russian missiles fired at Ukraine.\n\nSTR/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock\n\nRescue teams work in the rubble of the damaged residential building hit by shelling in Dnipro\n\nThe devastating strike in Dnipro hit the entrance of a nine-storey building, turning several floors into smouldering rubble, and leaving 73 injured, including 14 children, Ukrainian officials said, in what is likely to be the worst attack in months.\n\nA sizeable crowd gathered to watch the rescue effort at the site of the strike, while others joined rescue workers in a desperate search for survivors. There were urgent calls, human chains of volunteers clearing rubble and torch beams piercing thick clouds of dust and smoke.\n\nIn his address, Mr Zelensky said debris clearance in Dnipro would continue all night: \"We are fighting for every person, every life.\" So far, 38 people have been rescued from the building, including six children, officials say.\n\nThere is no information yet on why the apartment block was the object of such devastation, as it is some distance from the nearest power facility.\n\nOn a day when Russia seemed intent, once again, on targeting Ukraine's energy grid, this could have been one of the less accurate missiles in Russia's arsenal, or something brought down by Ukraine's air defences - although on the face of it, this seems a less likely explanation.\n\nIt has been two weeks since the last wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid. Mr Zelensky said of the energy infrastructure facilities hit on Saturday that the most difficult situation was in the Kharkiv and Kyiv regions.\n\nUkrainian state energy company Ukrenergo earlier said round-the-clock consumption limits had been set for all regions until midnight local time.\n\nOfficials, in the West and in Ukraine, had begun to wonder if Russia's \"energy war\" might be coming to an end, due to a possible shortage of suitable missiles and the evident fact the strategy has yet to break Ukraine's spirit.",

Kyiv, the capital, was also targeted.\n\nSunak made the pledge to provide Challenger 2 tanks and other artillery systems after speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday, the British leader's Downing Street office said in a statement.\n\nIt didn't say when the tanks would be delivered or how many. British media have reported that four British Army Challenger 2 main battle tanks will be sent to Eastern Europe immediately, with eight more to follow shortly after, without citing sources.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Russell Cheyne/AP Russell Cheyne/AP\n\nZelenskyy tweeted his thanks to Sunak on Saturday \"for the decisions that will not only strengthen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners.\"\n\nUkraine has for months sought to be supplied with heavier tanks, including the U.S. Abrams and the German Leopard 2 tanks, but Western leaders have been treading carefully.\n\nThe Czech Republic and Poland have provided Soviet-era T-72 tanks to Ukrainian forces.

The U.S. and Germany announced the same week that they would send Bradley fighting vehicles and Marder armored personnel carriers, respectively, for the first time.\n\nSunak's announcement came as Russian forces fired missiles at Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine on Saturday in the first major barrage in days.\n\nIn Dnipro, rescuers were using a crane to try to evacuate people trapped in the apartment building's upper stories, some of whom were signaling with the flashlights on their mobile phones, Tymoshenko said on Telegram. He also said there were likely people under the rubble.\n\nIn the northeastern Kharkiv region, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said two Russian missiles hit an infrastructure object again on Saturday afternoon, following a similar attack in the morning, In the city of Kharkiv, the subway suspended operations amid the attacks, according to its Telegram channel.\n\nAnother infrastructure facility was hit in the western Lviv region, according to Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi.\n\nAir defense systems were activated in other regions of Ukraine, as well, and as another round of air raid sirens sounded across the country in the afternoon, regional officials urged local residents to seek shelter.\n\nVitali Kim, governor of the southern Mykolaiv region, hinted in a Telegram post that some missiles have been intercepted over his province.\n\nMilitary top commander Valeri Zaluzhny said that Russia fired 33 cruise missiles overall on Saturday, of which 21 were shot down.\n\nEarlier in the day, explosions also rocked the capital, Kyiv. The blasts occurred before air sirens sounded, which is unusual. It's likely the explosions came ahead of the warning sirens because the attack was by ballistic missiles, which are faster than cruise missiles or drones.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat, Russia attacked Kyiv with ballistic missiles flying from the north.\n\n\"The ballistics are not easy for us to detect and shoot down,\" he told local media. The warning about the missile threat was late because of the lack of radar data and information from other sources.\n\nAn infrastructure target was hit in the morning missile attack, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nExplosions were heard in the Dniprovskyi district, a residential area on the left bank of the Dnieper River, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Klitschko also said that fragments of a missile fell on a nonresidential area in the Holosiivskyi district on the right bank, and a fire briefly broke out in a building there. No casualties have been reported so far.\n\nThis was the first attack on the Ukrainian capital since Jan. 1.\n\nOn Saturday morning, two Russian missiles hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The strikes with S-300 missiles targeted \"energy and industrial objects of Kharkiv and the (outlying) region,\" governor Syniehubov said. No casualties have been reported, but emergency power cuts in the city and other settlements of the region were possible, the official said.\n\nIn the city of Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine where fighting is most intense, three people were killed in Russian artillery attacks on Saturday, mayor Vitalii Barabash said. One person died in a rocket attack in Kryvyi Rih, in the Dnipropetrovsk region, Reznichenko said.\n\nThe attacks follow conflicting reports on the fate of the fiercely contested salt mining town of Soledar, in Ukraine's embattled east. Russia claims that its forces have captured the town, a development that would mark a rare victory for the Kremlin after a series of humiliating setbacks on the battlefield.\n\nUkrainian deputy defense minister Hanna Malyar said Saturday that the \"fiece battles for Soledar are continuing.\"\n\nMoscow has painted the battle for the town and the nearby city of Bakhmut as key to capturing the eastern region of the Donbas, which comprises of partially occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and as a way to grind down the best Ukrainian forces and prevent them from launching counterattacks elsewhere.\n\nBut that cuts both ways, as Ukraine says its fierce defense of the eastern strongholds has helped tie up Russian forces. Western officials and analysts say the two towns' importance is more symbolic than strategic.",

Russia has \"destroyed completely or seized\" networks in parts of Ukraine, and communications infrastructure in more than 10 out of the countrys 24 regions has been considerably damaged and destroyed, the Geneva-based International Telecommunication Union said. The report, which covers the first six months of the war, said: Since the beginning of military attacks, with the purpose of using the facilities in its interests and for its own needs, the aggressor either destroyed completely or seized the regular operation of public and private terrestrial telecommunication and critical infrastructure in the temporarily occupied and war-affected territories of Ukraine. The report goes on to allege that Moscow unilaterally switched Ukrainian dialling codes, fixed by the UN agency, to Russian ones, and that there had been 1,123 cyber-attacks against Ukraine. Russia has regularly targeted Ukraine with cyber-attacks since its annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nUpdated at 13.48 EST\n\n6 Jan 2023 13.06 EST Russia preparing to mobilise extra 500,000 conscripts, claims Ukraine Ukraines military intelligence has claimed that Russia is set to order the mobilisation of as many as 500,000 conscripts in January in addition to the 300,000 it called up in October, in another apparent sign that Vladimir Putin has no intention of ending the war. Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraines deputy military intelligence chief, said Ukraine believed the conscripts would be part of a string of Russian offensives over the spring and summer in the east and south of the country. Russia has denied it is preparing a second wave of mobilisation, with Putin saying last month it was \"pointless\" to talk about a new call-up, claiming that only half of those already mobilised had been sent to Ukraine. Russian officials, including Putin, previously denied plans to order a mobilisation before eventually declaring a \"partial mobilisation\" in September.

Russian forces also tried to storm one of the liberated villages in Luhansk oblast during the \"Chstrimas truce\", Haidai wrote on Telegram. He said: Briefly on the three hours of Putins Christmas truce in Luhansk region. From 12:00 to 15:00. The Ruscists fired artillery 14 times and stormed one of our settlements three times.

Sanctions have been imposed on six executives and board members of Qods Aviation Industries (QAI), also known as Light Airplanes Design and Manufacturing Industries, according to a statement by the US treasury department. It described QAI as a key Iranian defence manufacturer responsible for the design and production of drones. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in the statement: We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to deny Putin the weapons that he is using to wage his barbaric and unprovoked war on Ukraine. She added: The Kremlins reliance on suppliers of last resort like Iran shows their desperation in the face of brave Ukrainian resistance and the success of our global coalition in disrupting Russian military supply chains and denying them the inputs they need to replace weapons lost on the battlefield. The US has previously imposed sanctions on companies and people it accused of producing or transferring Iranian drones that Russia has used to attack civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\n6 Jan 2023 11.18 EST Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says he has spoken with Germanys chancellor, Olaf Scholz, a day after Berlin announced it would provide Kyiv with Marder infantry fighting vehicles and a Patriot air defence system. Zelenskiy says he thanked Scholz for the \"powerful\" defence package, and that the pair discussed \"further cooperation to strengthen the Ukrainian army\".

The EUs foreign policy chief Josep Borrell was speaking during a visit to Morocco, AFP reports. He said: The Kremlin totally lacks credibility and this declaration of a unilateral ceasefire is not credible. He added: It was Russia that launched this illegitimate aggression. When the aggressor talks of a ceasefire, I think the response that comes to us all is scepticism in the face of such hypocrisy. He called for \"concrete actions on the ground\", including \"a complete halt of military attacks\" and Moscows withdrawal of troops and military equipment from Ukrainian territory. He added: In the absence of such concrete actions, a unilateral ceasefire seems to be an attempt by Russia to buy time to regroup its troops and try to repair its damaged international reputation.\n\n6 Jan 2023 10.41 EST The Ukrainian government has reclaimed the main cathedral of a Russian-backed monastery in Kyiv and allowed the Orthodox Church of Ukraine to use it for Orthodox Christmas services. The 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex or Kyiv Monastery of the Caves was the headquarters of the Russian-backed wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox church (UOC) that falls under the Moscow patriarchate. The monastery is also a Ukrainian cultural treasure and a Unesco world heritage site. Uspenskyi (Holy Dormition) Cathedral and the Trapezna church at the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra monastery.

The war has sharpened the split between Ukraine and Russias Orthodox churches and intensified a feud over religious allegiance. In 2019, Ukraine was given permission by the spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians worldwide to form a church independent of Moscow, largely ending centuries of religious ties between the two countries.\n\n6 Jan 2023 09.59 EST Peter Beaumont On the roads leading to Ukraines frontlines, a striking change has become visible in recent months. Where once the armoured vehicles being ferried in were familiar from the Soviet era T-model tanks, BMPs and post-Soviet Ukrainian-built BTRs they have in recent months been joined by a growing array of western-supplied vehicles. Bushmasters from Australia can be seen alongside Polish Dziks and British-made Spartans, soon to be joined by scores of even more impressive vehicles: US Bradley and German Marder infantry fighting vehicles and French AMX-10 tank destroyers. French troops on an AMX-10 during a training exercise in France. Ukraines military have successfully emphasised speed and mobility not least in its successful counteroffensives in both the east and south against Russian forces. Photograph: Gouhier Nicolas/ABACA/REX/Shutterstock While Kyiv has been pushing hard for its allies to supply main battle banks, such as the US M1 Abrams and the German Leopard II, demands so far resisted, the armoured vehicles now pouring into Ukraine are in many ways a better fit for the kind of war and tactics that the Ukrainian military has been using against Russia. Faced with a shortage of armour at the beginning of the war, and on paper, at least heavily outgunned, Ukraines armed forces rapidly turned those shortcomings into advantages. Confronted with a lumbering Russian military approach that concentrated its heavy tanks and had a large reliance on recently upgraded Ukraines road system, Ukraines lighter forces have successfully emphasised speed and mobility not least in Kyivs successful counteroffensives in both the east and south against Russian forces.

Between August and September, as President Vladimir Putin indicated Russia would be willing to use nuclear weapons to defend its territory, Cold River targeted the Brookhaven (BNL), Argonne (ANL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), according to internet records that showed the hackers creating fake login pages for each institution and emailing nuclear scientists in a bid to make them reveal their passwords. Reuters was unable to determine why the labs were targeted or if any attempted intrusion was successful. Cold River has escalated its hacking campaign against Kyivs allies since the invasion of Ukraine, according to cybersecurity researchers and western government officials. The digital blitz against the US labs occurred as UN experts entered Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory to inspect Europes biggest atomic power plant and assess the risk of what both sides said could be a devastating radiation disaster amid heavy shelling nearby.\n\n6 Jan 2023 09.34 EST Reuters has updated its reporting on the situation in Ukraine. Here are the latest lines: Artillery fire could be heard from the front line in Ukraine on Friday, even after the official start of a unilateral ceasefire declared by Moscow and rejected by Kyiv. Russias defence ministry said its troops began observing the ceasefire from noon Moscow time (0900 GMT) \"along the entire line of contact\" in the conflict, but said Ukraine kept up shelling populated areas and military positions. Reuters could not immediately verify whether the intensity of fighting slowed following the start of the truce. One witness in the Russian-occupied regional capital Donetsk, close to the front, described outgoing artillery fired from pro-Russian positions on the citys outskirts after the truce was meant to take effect. In the hours prior, rockets slammed into a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk close to the eastern frontline, damaging 14 homes but with no casualties, the mayor said. Residents described several explosions. \"Its bad, very bad. We need to pressure them, get them to leave, maybe more air defence systems would help. This happens often, not only on festive occasions. Every other day,\" said Oleksnadr, 36, outside a supermarket at the time of the attack. One rescue worker was killed and four others injured after Russian forces shelled a fire department in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson before the deadline early on Friday, the regional governor said. Reuters could not immediately verify this. Shortly after the ceasefire was supposed to come into effect, Russian-backed officials accused Ukraine of shelling Donetsk with artillery, Russias state-run TASS news agency said. Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed leader in Donetsk, said on Thursday that Putins order only covered offensive operations and his forces would hit back if fired upon. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed administrator of Ukraines Kherson region, described the ceasefire as \"a gesture of goodwill,\" but said the situation on the front lines would not change because of it. Despite air raid warnings sounding in several regions, no major air strikes were reported by Ukrainian officials after the ceasefire starting time. The town of Bakhmut, 12 miles (20 km) southeast of Kramatorsk, has for months been the most intense battleground, still in Ukrainian hands despite dug-in trench warfare and months of battering by Russian forces that have left much of it in ruins. \"I tell people we should pray for the guys holding Bakhmut. If Bakhmut is given up, Kramatorsk will suffer heavily,\" said Yehven, 32, also at the supermarket.\n\nUpdated at 09.34 EST",

If you want to live, you have to get lower. The radar antenna that detects the target will not see it if the target is flying below the level of the antenna.\"\n\nDetails: When asked whether citizens can help the military, Ihnat explained that the ePPO [a smartphone application that can be used to notify Ukrainian air defence forces about Russian missiles and drones ed.] systems are unlikely to provide any information at the time of the attack.\n\nMost often drones fly at night, and Ukrainians can detect them only by sound. However, it is not that simple. While there is a warning system or calls to the police, time will pass and the drone will already be in another place (its speed is 150 km/h).\n\nThe most important thing for citizens is to take care of themselves and stay in shelters, the colonel explains.\n\nQuote: \"Because even with 100% air defence, unfortunately, fragments fall and can destroy cars, buildings and [take ed.] people's lives. When the missile hits the target, it does not explode immediately head-on with a Shahed, but next to it.\n\nThis is how anti-aircraft weapons work. Their hitting elements pierce the fuselage of a missile or drone, the missile loses its aerodynamic features and falls down. Its warhead does not necessarily explode upon impact with an anti-aircraft missile. Meaning, this warhead and the fragments of the anti-aircraft missile fall to the ground.\"\n\nBackground: With incredible efforts, the Ukrainian air defence system shot down 84 Russian drones at night of the two days of the New Year celebration, demonstrating 100% results.\n\nAt the same time, the Air Force emphasises that Ukraine will need more air defence systems to effectively counter these weapons with such an intensity of the invaders.\n\nJournalists fight on their own frontline.

VITALII MATOKHA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Saturday promised to provide tanks and artillery systems to Ukraine. Sunak made the pledge to provide Challenger 2 tanks and other artillery systems after speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday, the British leader's Downing Street office said in a statement.\n\nIt didn't say when the tanks would be delivered or how many. British media have reported that four British Army Challenger 2 main battle tanks will be sent to Eastern Europe immediately, with eight more to follow shortly after, without citing sources.\n\nZelenskyy tweeted his thanks to Sunak on Saturday \"for the decisions that will not only strengthen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners.\"\n\nUkraine has for months sought to be supplied with heavier tanks, including the U.S. Abrams and the German Leopard 2 tanks, but Western leaders have been treading carefully.\n\nThe Czech Republic and Poland have provided Soviet-era T-72 tanks to Ukrainian forces. Poland has also expressed readiness to provide a company of Leopard tanks, but President Andrzej Duda stressed during his recent visit to the Ukrainian city of Lviv that the move would be possible only as an element in a larger international coalition of tank aid to Kyiv.\n\nEarlier this month, France said it would send AMX-10 RC armored combat vehicles to Ukraine, designated \"light tanks\" in French. The U.S. and Germany announced the same week that they would send Bradley fighting vehicles and Marder armored personnel carriers, respectively, for the first time.\n\nSunak's announcement came as Russian forces fired missiles at Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine on Saturday in the first major barrage in days.\n\nIn Dnipro, rescuers were using a crane to try to evacuate people trapped in the apartment building's upper stories, some of whom were signaling with the flashlights on their mobile phones, Tymoshenko said on Telegram.

Maksym Kozytskyi.\n\nAir defense systems were activated in other regions of Ukraine, as well, and as another round of air raid sirens sounded across the country in the afternoon, regional officials urged local residents to seek shelter.\n\nVitali Kim, governor of the southern Mykolaiv region, hinted in a Telegram post that some missiles have been intercepted over his province.\n\nMilitary top commander Valeri Zaluzhny said that Russia fired 33 cruise missiles overall on Saturday, of which 21 were shot down.\n\nEarlier in the day, explosions also rocked the capital, Kyiv. The blasts occurred before air sirens sounded, which is unusual. It's likely the explosions came ahead of the warning sirens because the attack was by ballistic missiles, which are faster than cruise missiles or drones.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat, Russia attacked Kyiv with ballistic missiles flying from the north.\n\n\"The ballistics are not easy for us to detect and shoot down,\" he told local media. The warning about the missile threat was late because of the lack of radar data and information from other sources.\n\nAn infrastructure target was hit in the morning missile attack, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nExplosions were heard in the Dniprovskyi district, a residential area on the left bank of the Dnieper River, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Klitschko also said that fragments of a missile fell on a nonresidential area in the Holosiivskyi district on the right bank, and a fire briefly broke out in a building there. No casualties have been reported so far.\n\nThis was the first attack on the Ukrainian capital since Jan. 1.\n\nOn Saturday morning, two Russian missiles hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The strikes with S-300 missiles targeted \"energy and industrial objects of Kharkiv and the (outlying) region,\" governor Syniehubov said. No casualties have been reported, but emergency power cuts in the city and other settlements of the region were possible, the official said.\n\nIn the city of Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine where fighting is most intense, three people were killed in Russian artillery attacks on Saturday, mayor Vitalii Barabash said. One person died in a rocket attack in Kryvyi Rih, in the Dnipropetrovsk region, Reznichenko said.\n\nThe attacks follow conflicting reports on the fate of the fiercely contested salt mining town of Soledar, in Ukraine's embattled east.

Laura Boushnak for The New York Times\n\nThey are lumbering and noisy and relatively easy to shoot from the sky. Over the New Years weekend, the Ukrainian military said it downed every single one of the 80-odd exploding drones that Russia sent the countrys way.\n\n\"Such results have never been achieved before,\" a Ukrainian Air Force spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nBut beneath that result lies a question: How long can Ukraine sustain its effort when many of its defensive measures cost far more than the drones do?\n\nThe Shahed-136 drones used by Russia and supplied by Iran are relatively cheap, while the array of weapons used to shoot them out of the sky are much more expensive, according to experts.\n\nArtem Starosiek, the head of Molfar, a Ukrainian consultancy that supports the countrys war effort, estimated that it costs up to seven times more to use a missile to shoot down a drone than it does to launch one. The Iranian drones can cost as little as $20,000 to produce, while the cost of firing one of the surface-to-air missiles used by Ukraine can range from $140,000 for a Soviet-era S-300 to $500,000 for a U.S.-made NASAM, or National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System.\n\nThat is an imbalance that could over time favor Russia, costing Ukraine and its allies dearly, some analysts say.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a recent overnight speech that Russia is betting on the \"exhaustion of our people, our air defense, our energy sector.\"\n\nMolfar said it estimated that, since September, Russia had fired around 600 drones at Ukraine. The campaign, which gathered pace just as Moscow sustained a series of battlefield losses, has caused rolling blackouts and outages just as the countrys harsh winter has started to bite, compounding the misery caused by Russias full-scale invasion.\n\nImage Searchlights hunting for drones over Kyiv on Sunday.

Credit... Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times\n\nBoth sides have used drones not just for reconnaissance and attacks since Russias invasion began in February, the first time that they have been widely deployed in a European war.\n\nMilitary authorities in Kyiv have said little about the details of their air defenses in line with the operational secrecy that has shrouded much of their war planning, or about the cost, making analysis difficult.\n\nUkraines forces have used antiaircraft guns and small-arms fire to down some drones, but increasingly, as the Russians have taken to launching assaults at night, Kyiv has also relied heavily on missiles fired from warplanes and the ground. Officials said that Ukraine has employed surface-to-air missiles known as NASAMs multiple times over the weekend to counter drones.\n\nMichael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the CNA research institute, said that Ukrainians are using \"a zoo of different air defense systems\" to combat the threat, including Soviet-era and NATO missile systems, each with its own cost profile.\n\nSome of Ukraines antiaircraft guns, like the Gepard 2 radar-directed mobile gun system, are inexpensive in comparison with other Soviet-era and European defense systems being deployed. And some of the American-made interceptor missiles are relatively expensive.\n\nEven so, Mr. Starosiek said, the expense of downing the drones with missiles needed to be seen in context. It costs far less to shoot down a drone than to repair a damaged or destroyed power station, he noted. And then there is the human factor.\n\n\"People are still alive,\" he said.\n\nIn a report issued on Nov. 7, Molfar said that 82 percent of the drones were being shot down, but that figure has since increased.\n\nImage A damaged building after a Russian drone attack in Kyiv in December. Credit... Laura Boushnak for The New York Times\n\nUkraine currently depends on its allies, chief among them the United States, to resupply its air defense systems and foot the bill, he said. There is a danger those allies will grow weary of the cost over time.\n\n\"The cost is irrelevant as long as the West keeps providing military assistance to Ukraine,\" Mr. Boulegue said.",

(Greg Baker/Pool/AFP/Getty Images/FILE)\n\nIn opening remarks during a video conference Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin invited his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to visit Moscow next spring. He added that the two countries would strengthen cooperation between their armed forces, and pointed to growth in trade despite \"unfavorable market conditions.\"\n\nBilateral relations are \"the best in history, and withstand all tests,\" he said. \"We share the same views on the causes, course and logic of the ongoing transformation of the global geopolitical landscape.\"\n\nXi also delivered opening remarks, saying \"against the background of a difficult international situation, China is ready to increase political cooperation with Russia\" and to be \"global partners,\" according to the Russian state media translation of the broadcast.\n\nMoscow and Beijing have drawn closer in recent years, with Xi and Putin declaring the two countries had a \"no limits\" partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nChina has since refused to condemn the aggression, instead repeatedly laying blame for the conflict on NATO and the United States and remaining one of Russias key remaining supporters as it grows increasingly isolated on the global stage.\n\nBut more than 10 months into the grinding war, the world looks much different and the dynamic between both partners has shifted accordingly, experts say.\n\nInstead of an anticipated swift victory, Putins invasion has faltered with numerous setbacks on the battlefield, including a lack of basic equipment. Morale within parts of Russia is low, with many civilians facing economic hardship during the bitter winter.\n\nOn Thursday, Russia launched what Ukrainian officials described as one of the biggest missile barrages since the war began in February, with explosions rattling villages and cities across Ukraine, damaging civilian infrastructure and killing at least three people.\n\nUkrainian officials have been cautioning for days that Russia is preparing to launch an all-out assault on the power grid to close out 2022, plummeting the country into darkness as Ukrainians attempt to ring in the New Year and celebrate the Christmas holidays, which for the countrys Orthodox Christians falls on January 7.\n\n\"China is eager for (the war) to end,\" said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center.\n\n\"Xi will try to emphasize the importance of peace to Putin,\" she added. \"As Russia is getting impatient with the lack of progress on the battlefield, the timing is ripening for peace talk in Chinas eyes.\"\n\nRead more here.",

All times EST.\n\n9:34 p.m.: Berlin and Washington are coordinating a \"qualitative new step\" in their weapons deliveries to Ukraine, German government sources told Agence France-Presse Thursday, following growing calls on Chancellor Olaf Scholz to act.\n\n\"We are constantly looking at what more we can do in terms of military support,\" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said at a news conference with her British counterpart James Cleverly in London.\n\nThis included both \"defensive weapons\" and arms needed to \"free occupied territory\" from Russia, she added.\n\n8:22 p.m.:\n\n7:33 p.m.: The United States is of the view that Russian President Vladimir Putin's ally Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is the founder of Russia's most powerful mercenary group, is interested in taking control of salt and gypsum from mines near the Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut, Reuters reported, citing a White House official said on Thursday. There are indications that monetary motives are driving Russia's and Prigozhin's \"obsession\" with Bakhmut, the official added. Prigozhin is the owner of private Russian military company Wagner Group. The United States has previously accused Russian mercenaries of exploiting natural resources in the Central African Republic, Mali, Sudan and elsewhere to help fund Moscow's war in Ukraine, a charge Russia rejected as \"anti-Russian rage.\" 6:48 p.m.:\n\n6:06 p.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected out of hand on Thursday a Russian order for a truce over Orthodox Christmas, Reuters reported, saying it was a trick to halt the progress of Ukraine's forces in the eastern Donbas region and bring in more of their own.\n\nSpeaking pointedly in Russian and addressing both the Kremlin and Russians as a whole, Zelenskyy said Moscow had repeatedly ignored Kyiv's own peace plan. The war would end, he said, when Russian troops left Ukraine or were thrown out.\n\n\"They now want to use Christmas as a cover, albeit briefly, to stop the advances of our boys in Donbas and bring equipment, ammunitions and mobilized troops closer to our positions,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.\n\nZelenskyy said that ending the war meant \"ending your country's aggression ... This continues every day that your soldiers are on our soil ... And the war will end either when your soldiers leave or we throw them out.\"\n\nHe urged Russians to challenge President Vladimir Putin's premise of portraying the war as necessary to safeguard Moscow's interests against the West and root out nationalists.\n\n\"But in order to end the war more quickly, we need something completely different. We need Russian citizens to find the courage in themselves, albeit for 36 hours, albeit during Christmas, to free themselves of the shameful fear of one man in the Kremlin.\"\n\n5:02 p.m.: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday pressed Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to declare a unilateral cease-fire in Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nErdogan spoke to both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his latest attempts to broker an end to the 10-month war.\n\nHe told Putin that \"calls for peace and negotiations should be supported by a unilateral cease-fire and a vision for a fair solution,\" Erdogan's office said.\n\nBut he made no mention of a unilateral cease-fire in his subsequent talks with the Ukrainian leader.\n\n\"Erdogan stated that as Turkey, we are ready to facilitate and mediate the establishment of a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine,\" the Turkish presidency said after the call\n\n4 p.m.: A new U.S. weapons package for Ukraine will include about 50 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, two U.S. officials said on Thursday, with one of the officials saying the package will be worth roughly $2.8 billion, Reuters reported.\n\nOn Wednesday President Joe Biden said that sending Bradley Fighting Vehicles, a U.S. Army staple, to Ukraine was being considered to help fight Russia's invasion.\n\nThe latest security package for Ukraine is expected to be unveiled on Friday, the officials said.\n\nOf the roughly $2.8 billion package, around $800 million of the funds came from Foreign Military Financing to help Ukraine procure weapons, the one official said. The balance of the funds came from Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) for Ukraine, which allows the United States to transfer defense articles like Humvees, trucks and munitions from stocks quickly without congressional approval in response to an emergency.\n\nThe armored vehicle with a powerful gun, which is manufactured by BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L), has been used as a staple by the U.S. Army to carry troops around battlefields since the mid-1980s.\n\n3:10 p.m.:\n\n2:30 p.m.: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov expressed doubt on Thursday that the rejection of Russia's proposed truce by an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reflected the Ukrainian leader's view, Reuters reported, quoting the Interfax news agency.\n\n\"It is difficult for us to judge whether Podolyak's opinion reflects the view of the president of Ukraine,\" Interfax quoted Peskov as saying.\n\nZelenskyy has yet to comment on the proposed truce during Orthodox Christmas celebrations. Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak rejected the proposal as \"hypocrisy,\" saying such an arrangement would only be possible if Russia left all territories it occupied.\n\n2:15 p.m.: Independent political analyst Tatyana Stanovaya said Putins cease-fire order is intended to make him look reasonable and interested in peace, The Associated Press reported Thursday.\n\nThe move \"fits well into Putins logic, in which Russia is acting on the right side of history and fighting for justice,\" she said.\n\n\"We must not forget that in this war, Putin feels like a good guy, doing good not only for himself and the brotherly nations, but also for the world hes freeing from the hegemony of the United States,\" Stanovaya, founder of the independent R.Politik think tank, wrote on Telegram.\n\nShe also linked Putins move to Ukrainian forces recent strike on Makiivka that killed at least 89 Russian servicemen. \"He really doesnt want to get something like that for Christmas,\" the analyst said.\n\nUkrainians reacted with suspicion to Putins holiday cease-fire announcement.\n\n\"Frankly speaking, the 8th of March (Womens Day), (Ukraines) independence day (Aug. 24), Christmas (Dec. 25) and the New Year, there were no cease-fires. Why should there be one now?\" said Sophiia Romanovska, a 21-year-old student who fled besieged Mariupol for Kyiv, peppering her comment with expletives.\n\nPutin issued the truce order after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged him in a phone call Thursday to implement a \"unilateral cease-fire,\" according to the Turkish presidents office. The Kremlin said the Russian president \"reaffirmed Russias openness to a serious dialogue\" with Ukrainian authorities.\n\nPrevious attempts at peace talks have failed over Russias territorial demands, because Ukraine insists that Russia withdraw from occupied areas.\n\n2:05 p.m.: A U.N. spokesman said Thursday that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomes Russias proposal for a 36-hour Christmas ceasefire in Ukraine, VOAs U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer reported.\n\n\"Christmas represents a holy period for both Russians and Ukrainians. The possibility that this holy period be respected with a cessation of all hostilities is always welcome by the Secretary-General, knowing that this will not replace a just peace in line with the U.N. Charter and international law,\" U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters.\n\n1:50 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden suggested Vladimir Putin's struggle in Ukraine after 10 months of war and thousands of lives lost had prompted the Russian president to offer a 36-hour truce, saying, \"I think he's trying to find some oxygen,\" Reuters reported.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had ordered a cease-fire from midday on Friday after a call for a Christmas truce by Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nUkraine spurned the cease-fire offer over Orthodox Christmas, saying there would be no truce until Russia withdraws its invading forces from occupied land.\n\nAsked about the proposed truce, Biden told reporters at the White House: \"I'm reluctant to respond to anything that Putin says. I found it interesting that he was willing to bomb hospitals and nurseries and churches ... on the 25th and New Year's. I mean, I think he's trying to find some oxygen.\"\n\n1:30 p.m.:\n\n1:15 p.m.: U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has disbanded a fact-finding mission into a July attack in the front-line Ukrainian town of Olenivka that killed prisoners held by Moscow-backed separatists, because the U.N. mission cannot deploy to the site, a U.N. spokesman said on Thursday.\n\nRussia and Ukraine both requested an investigation, which Guterres had announced in August.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the Secretary-General reiterated his call for full respect of international humanitarian and human rights law, including the protection and treatment of prisoners of war, VOAs U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer reported.\n\nDujarric said the U.N. requires clear safety and access guarantees from both sides and they didnt feel they had received them. He said if get they get the guarantees, then the Secretary-General stands ready to reconstitute the team.\n\n1:05 p.m.: Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russia's most powerful mercenary group, bade farewell on Thursday to former convicts who had served out their contracts in Ukraine and urged them to avoid the temptation to kill when back in civilian life, Reuters reported.\n\nWagner Group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, has fought in Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic and Mali as well as in Ukraine.\n\nAfter President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Prigozhin emerged from the shadows and recruited thousands of men from prisons, offering them the chance of freedom in return for serving in some of the most dangerous battles in Ukraine.\n\nPrigozhin, who has been sanctioned by Western countries for his role in Wagner, was shown in footage supplied by RIA state news agency shaking hands with the first group of convicts who had gained their freedom after serving for six months.\n\nYaroslav Trofimov, Chief Foreign-Affairs Correspondent of The Wall Street Journal, shared the RIA video on Twitter Thursday.\n\n12:45 p.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent a frigate armed with the countrys latest Zircon hypersonic missile on a trans-ocean cruise in a show of force as tensions with the West escalate over the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia touts that the Zircon missile can evade any Western air defenses by flying at an astounding 7,000 miles per hour (11,265 km/h).\n\nThe Associated Press published this explainer about the ship and its weapons on Thursday.\n\n12:20 p.m.: Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday warned the United States that hypersonic missiles would soon be close to NATOs shores after the U.S. embassy said in a video it stood in solidarity with Russians who opposed the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nRussias invasion of Ukraine has triggered one of the most deadly wars in Europe since World War Two and the deepest crisis in Moscows relations with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\n\"The main gift for the New Year with an ammunition package of Zircon missiles left yesterday for the shores of NATO countries,\" Medvedev said, referring to President Vladimir Putins deployment of a warship with hypersonic cruise missiles to the Atlantic.\n\nMedvedev said the missiles could be placed 100 miles (160 km) off the U.S. coast, adding: \"So rejoice! It will bring to their senses anyone who poses a direct threat to Russia and our allies.\"\n\nHe was speaking after the U.S. embassy to Russia released a video that it called an \"an appeal to the people of Russia\". The 50-second video included images of the impact of bombing in Ukraine, saying what was happening there \"is not worthy of you\".\n\n\"We stand in solidarity with each of you who are striving to create a more peaceful future,\" the video said, showing an image of the slogan \"No to war\" in Russian sprayed on a wall.\n\n12:05 p.m.: Anti-drone tools and logistics equipment are among a new batch of German military aid granted to Ukraine, the Kyiv Independent reported on Twitter Thursday.\n\n11:50 a.m.: The U.S. will provide $30 million in aid to Moldova to help the small country tackle an energy crisis and other economic hardships \"caused by the Kremlins unprovoked and unjustified war\" against Ukraine, a U.S. government aid agency said Thursday, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development said the funds will be paid to Moldova one of Europes poorest countries, landlocked between Ukraine and Romania through a World Bank trust fund. The country will also be reimbursed for previous electricity purchases.\n\nUSAID said that as Moldova began to recover from a recent \"series of severe shocks\" including the COVID-19 pandemic and a fourfold increase in natural gas prices, the war in Ukraine has placed its \"short-term economic recovery and its long-term economic prospects at risk.\"\n\nIn a statement, the agency called the aid \"critical\" because of the wars impact.\n\nSince Moscows forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Moldova a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.6 million has lurched from crisis to crisis.\n\nThese include large arrivals of refugees fleeing safety from the war next door and an acute energy crisis that worsened after Moscow on which Moldova was entirely dependent for natural gas dramatically reduced supplies. Additionally, skyrocketing inflation left some officials worried citizens would be unable to pay their winter energy bills.\n\n11:40 a.m.:\n\n11:30 a.m.: Russia and Belarus have beefed up their joint military grouping in Belarus with weapons, soldiers and specialized equipment, and plan to hold joint aviation drills, the Belarusian Defense Ministry said on Thursday, Reuters reported.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly warned that President Vladimir Putin may try to use Belarus to launch a new ground invasion of Ukraine from the north, a step that would open a major new front in the war.\n\n\"The decision to create a regional grouping of troops on the territory of Belarus was made and is being implemented solely in the interests of strengthening the protection and defense of the Union State, based on the current situation near our borders,\" the Belarusian Defense Ministry said.\n\n\"Personnel, weapons, military and special equipment of the armed forces of the Russian Federation will continue to arrive in the Republic of Belarus,\" the ministry said.\n\nBelarus allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine on February 24.\n\n11:15 a.m.:\n\n11 a.m.: Ukraine spurned an offer from Russian President Vladimir Putin for a 36-hour ceasefire over Orthodox Christmas, saying there would be no truce until Russia withdraws its invading forces from occupied land, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had ordered a ceasefire from midday on Friday after a call for a Christmas truce from Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\n\"Taking into account the appeal of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill, I instruct the Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation to introduce a ceasefire regime along the entire line of contact of the parties in Ukraine from 12:00 on January 6, 2023 to 24:00 on January 7, 2023,\" Putin said in the order.\n\n\"Proceeding from the fact that a large number of citizens professing Orthodoxy live in the areas of hostilities, we call on the Ukrainian side to declare a ceasefire and allow them to attend services on Christmas Eve, as well as on Christmas Day,\" Putin said.\n\nBut Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhailo Podolyak tweeted back that Russia \"must leave the occupied territories - only then will it have a 'temporary truce'. Keep hypocrisy to yourself.\"\n\n10:54 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday ordered Moscows armed forces to hold a 36-hour cease-fire in Ukraine this weekend for the Russian Orthodox Christmas holiday, The Associated Press reports, quoting the Kremlin.\n\nThe order follows a proposal by the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill.\n\n10:30 a.m.: Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, called on Thursday for both sides of the war in Ukraine to observe a Christmas truce, a step dismissed by Kyiv as a cynical trap, Reuters reported.\n\nMany Orthodox Christians, including those living in Russia and Ukraine, celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6-7.\n\n\"I, Kirill, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, appeal to all the parties involved in the internecine conflict to cease fire and establish a Christmas truce from 12:00 on Jan. 6 until 24:00 on Jan. 7 so that Orthodox people can attend services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day,\" he said.\n\nA senior aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Mykhailo Podolyak, cast the Russian Orthodox Church as a \"war propagandist\" that had incited the \"mass murder\" of Ukrainians and the militarization of Russia.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church is by far the biggest of the churches in the Eastern Orthodox communion, which split with Western Christianity in the Great Schism of 1054. Today it has about 100 million followers within Russia and more outside.\n\n10:10 a.m.: The United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) and its partners in Ukraine brought children together through a network of Spilno Child Spots to enjoy a more festive holiday season despite the war with Russia, UNICEF said in a statement. In addition to activities and crafts, it also provides health and safety lessons for children and youth, UNICEF said.\n\n9:50 a.m.: The French Defense Ministry said Thursday it will soon hold talks with its Ukrainian counterpart to arrange for the delivery of armored combat vehicles in what Frances presidency says will be the first time this type of Western-made wheeled tank destroyer will be given to the Ukrainian military, The Associated Press reported.\n\nDiscussions will include the delivery timetable and the training of Ukrainian soldiers on the equipment, the ministry said.\n\nDesignated as \"light tanks\" in French, the AMX-10 RC carries a 105-milimeter cannon and two machine guns. Its primarily designed for reconnaissance missions and has enough armor to protect against light infantry weapons, according to the French defense ministry. They have wheels rather than tracks, allowing it to be more mobile than heavy tanks.\n\nThe decision is another in Frances military support to Ukraine, following the French defense ministers visit to Kyiv last week.\n\n9:25 a.m.: Russian companies have been banned from participating in the CES-2023 consumer-technology expo in Las Vegas, organizers said January 4, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n\n\"We did not welcome them this year, given the political situation,\" said Gary Shapiro, head of the Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event. \"We just didnt feel it was appropriate.\"\n\nShapiro said that about a dozen Ukrainian tech firms were expected to display at the show, which runs from January 5-8.\n\n9:05 a.m.:\n\n8:55 a.m.: President Vladimir Putin told Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday that Russia was open to dialogue over Ukraine, but that Kyiv would have to accept the loss of territories claimed by Russia, Reuters reported, quoting the Kremlin.\n\n\"Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Russia's openness to a serious dialogue, provided that the Kiev authorities fulfill the wellknown and repeatedly voiced requirements and take into account the new territorial realities,\" the Kremlin said.\n\nPutin also \"acknowledged the destructive role of the West, pumping weapons into Kyiv, providing information and guidance,\" the Kremlin said.\n\nThe presidents also discussed a number of energy issues, including the creation of a gas hub in Turkey and the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, the Kremlin said.\n\nErdogan and the Russian president have spoken repeatedly since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February. Turkey acted as mediator alongside the United Nations to set up a deal allowing grain exports from Ukrainian ports.\n\n8:40 a.m.: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told Vladimir Putin in a phone call that peace efforts in the Russia-Ukraine war should be supported by a unilateral ceasefire and a \"vision for a fair solution,\" the Turkish presidency said on Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nErdogan and the Russian president have spoken repeatedly since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February. Turkey acted as mediator alongside the United Nations to set up a deal allowing grain exports from Ukrainian ports.\n\n\"President Erdogan said calls for peace and negotiations should be supported by a unilateral ceasefire and a vision for a fair solution,\" the readout said, adding that Erdogan reminded Putin of the positive outcomes of the grains corridor deal.\n\n8:25 a.m.:\n\n8:10 a.m.: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday it would be dangerous to underestimate Russia and President Vladimir Putin's ambitions amid the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\n\"They have shown a great willingness to tolerate losses and suffering,\" Stoltenberg told a business conference in Norway.\n\n\"We have no indication that President Putin has changed his plans and goals in Ukraine. So it's dangerous to underestimate Russia.\"\n\nNATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu on Thursday tweeted a link to Stoltenbergs full speech.\n\n7:55 a.m.: France's decision to send light AMX-10 RC armored combat vehicles to Ukraine prompted renewed calls from within German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition for Berlin to send more modern fighting vehicles to help in the war against Russia, according to Reuters.\n\nMarie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, the head of the parliamentary defense committee and a member of Scholz's junior coalition partner Free Democrats (FDP), called for Berlin to send Marder infantry fighting vehicles and train Ukrainians to use them. Sara Nanni, the security policy spokesperson from the Greens party, another coalition partner, said Germany should send Marders and Leopard tanks.\n\nScholz's government ramped up defense spending and sent aid and weapons to Ukraine since Russia invaded last February, but as other Western powers has sometimes hesitated to send powerful weapons for fear of risking direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nScholz has also made it clear that he did not want to go it alone on sending heavy weapons to Ukraine and that he would coordinate deliveries with other members of the NATO alliance. A government spokesperson and the defense ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked France for the AMX-10 RC vehicles, saying other allies should take that as a signal and that \"there is no rational reason why Ukraine has not yet been supplied with western tanks.\"\n\n7:35 a.m.:\n\n7:15 a.m.: A French court on Thursday postponed to January 19 a hearing on whether to extradite Ukrainian billionaire Kostyantyn Zhevago to his home country, Reuters reported.\n\nThe court in Chambery, in eastern France, is set to decide later in the day whether the businessman, one of Ukraine's richest men, will stay behind bars in the meantime or can be freed. The 48-year-old billionaire, who controls London-listed iron pellet producer Ferrexpo, was arrested and detained in France in late December at Ukraine's request.\n\nUkraine's state bureau of investigation DBR has said the billionaire was wanted on suspicion of embezzlement and money-laundering linked to the disappearance of $113 million from the now bankrupt lender Finance & Credit Bank.\n\nZhevago, who served in the Ukrainian parliament from 1998 to 2019, primarily as an independent, denied any wrongdoing and is fighting the request to extradite him to Ukraine. Zhevago told the court the case against him was political.\n\nThe case comes amid Ukraine's broader efforts to clean up its oligarch-dominated economy. Since Ukraine's independence in 1991, a small group of elites have dominated its political system and economy. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pledged to reduce the role of oligarchs in the economy.\n\n6:50 a.m.:\n\n6:25 a.m.: Ukrainian and Russian troops battled in eastern regions on Thursday as Kyiv tried to push back occupying forces, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the West to provide his army with heavy tanks to boost their firepower, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said the Russians were focused on an offensive in the Bakhmut sector of the Donetsk region, but their attacks in the Avdiivka and Kupiansk sectors were unsuccessful.\n\nThe governor of neighboring Luhansk region, meanwhile, said Ukrainian troops were recapturing areas there \"step-by-step\" but cautioned it was \"not happening fast.\"\n\nLuhansk and Donetsk make up the Donbas region, Ukraine's industrial heartland, parts of which were seized by Russian-backed proxies in 2014.\n\nRussia declared Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as part of its territory in September after referendums condemned by Ukraine and Western countries. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.\n\nBakhmut, which is now largely in ruins after months of battering by Russian artillery, is important because the Russian leadership wants to have a success to hold up to the Russian public after a series of setbacks in the war.\n\nIt is located on a strategic supply line between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Gaining control of the city, with a pre-war population of 70,000-80,000 that has shrunk to close to 10,000, could give Russia a steppingstone to advance on two bigger cities Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.\n\nFighting has been particularly tough there, with commanders on both sides describing it as a \"meat grinder.\"\n\nUkraine's military said it estimated 800 Russian soldiers were killed in the past day, mostly in fighting in Donetsk. The figure which would signify a huge loss of life for a single day could not be independently confirmed.\n\nThe Luhansk governor, Serhiy Haidai, said he expected fighting to intensify across the eastern front as temperatures drop further and the ground freezes.\n\n\"Then the opportunity to use heavy equipment will open up,\" he said.\n\n6:15 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the situation in Ukraine, Syria and energy issues with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan, Reuters reported Thursday, citing the Kremlin.\n\nAccording to the Kremlin, Putin \"acknowledged the destructive role of the West, pumping weapons into Kyiv, providing information and guidance.\"\n\nPutin said that Russia was ready for a dialog on Ukraine, but that Kyiv must fulfill the previously announced requirements and take into account \"new territorial realities.\"\n\n5:12 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that Russia increasingly relies on Iranian-made drones to hit Ukrainian critical infrastructure. Russia will likely seek further bilateral cooperation with Iran in order to secure a greater number of high-precision weapons systems for use in Ukraine, the assessment said.\n\nRussian forces continued limited counterattacks to regain lost positions along the Svatove-Kreminna line as Ukrainian strikes reportedly damaged Russian military logistics in Luhansk Oblast. They also continued offensive operations around Bakhmut amid continued indicators that the broader offensive may be culminating. In addition, Russian forces continued offensive operations on the western outskirts of Donetsk City.\n\n4:07 a.m.: The United States is looking at ways to target Iranian drone production through sanctions and export controls, and it is talking to private companies whose parts have been used in production, the White House said on Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n\n\"We are assessing further steps we can take in terms of export controls to restrict Irans access to technologies used in drones,\" White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement.\n\nThe United States has previously imposed sanctions on companies and people it accused of producing or transferring Iranian drones that Russia has used to attack civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\n3:09 a.m.: The United States is not \"hand-wringing\" over the mass casualties of Russian soldiers in a Ukrainian attack reportedly using U.S.-supplied artillery, a senior White House official said Wednesday, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThe New Year's strike hit a building in the occupied eastern Ukrainian town of Makiivka being used as a barracks. Russia has officially conceded there were 89 deaths, an unusually high number, while Ukraine's military estimates that nearly 400 soldiers died.\n\nFollowing criticism in Russia over the use of U.S.-delivered weaponry by Ukrainian defenders, including in the Makiivka strike, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Russia is to blame.\n\nThere is no \"hand-wringing by the administration at all. This is a war. They have been invaded and they (Ukrainians) are striking back and defending themselves,\" Kirby said. \"Russian soldiers in their territory are legitimate targets for Ukrainian military action, period.\"\n\n2:05 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said that in December, Ukraine hit Russia's long-range aviation air base, damaging several aircraft.\n\n\"Russia has highly likely responded to the incidents by conducting a general dispersal of LRA aircraft, especially to airfields further away from Ukraine,\" the update said. The new locations mean that while Russia will still be able to use the craft, it'll cause more wear on the planes that \"will further deplete the limited flying hours available on these aging aircraft.\"\n\n1:08 a.m.: Serbia's president said Wednesday that the European Union's calls for his country to join sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine represent \"a brutal\" interference in the internal affairs of the Balkan state, which has asked to join the EU, The Associated Press reported.\n\nIn his wide-ranging year-end address to the nation, Aleksandar Vucic praised his and his country's economic and political achievements, comparing himself to a wolf who cannot be tamed under international pressure.\n\nAlthough formally seeking EU membership, Serbia has repeatedly ignored calls to align its foreign policies with the 27-nation bloc, including joining international sanctions against Moscow over the war in Ukraine.\n\nSerbia remains the only European country besides Belarus that has refused to introduce sanctions against Russia, its Slavic ally.\n\nRussia has been supporting Serbia's claim over its former province of Kosovo which declared independence in 2008 with Western support.\n\n12:02 a.m.: Australia announced Thursday it will boost its defense capabilities by spending more than 1 billion Australian dollars ($700 million) on new advanced missile and rocket systems, including U.S.-made HIMARS, which have been successfully used by Ukraine's military.\n\nIn Ukraine, the mobile, truck-mounted HIMARS have proved crucial in enabling Ukrainian forces to hit key targets, including a recent strike on a single building that killed at least 89 Russian soldiers.\n\nThe Australian government said the HIMARS it was buying included launchers, missiles and training rockets and would be in use by 2026. It said the system had a current range of 300 kilometers, which was expected to increase with technological advances.\n\nThe government said it had also signed a contract with Norway-based Kongsberg to buy Naval Strike Missiles for navy destroyers and frigates, which would replace aging Harpoon anti-ship missiles from next year.\n\nSome information in this report came from Reuters, The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.",
